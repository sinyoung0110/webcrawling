Therefore, according to the change of the modern art world, art education using artificial intelligence is needed in schools. In this study, the art learning support tool based on deep learning were developed to support students’ art education activities. The art learning support tool used the neural transfer algorithm in deep learning generative models. The neural transfer algorithm can combine two images to create a single image. In order to develop the art learning support tool, researchers developed initial prototypes through literature research and needs analysis according to the design and development research methodology. The students’ satisfaction level with the tool was analyzed through class demonstrations. In the survey of the effects and perceptions of art learning support tools, learners were generally satisfied with it.

The principle goal of scheduling is to limit resource starvation and to guarantee fairness among the parties using the resources. The demand for resources fluctuates dynamically hence the prearranging of resources is a challenging task. Many task-scheduling approaches have been used in the cloud-computing environment. Security in cloud computing environment is one of the core issue in distributed computing. We have designed a deep learning-based security model for scheduling tasks in cloud computing and it has been implemented using CloudSim 3.0 simulator written in Java and verification of the results from different perspectives, such as response time with and without security factors, makespan, cost, CPU utilization, I/O utilization, Memory utilization, and execution time is compared with Round Robin (RR) and Waited Round Robin (WRR) algorithms"

For about 200 years, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd industrial revolutions were experienced, and the 4th industrial revolution was declared in 2015. Declared to commercialize 5G in 2020. By 2020, it will enter the era of the fourth industrial revolution. Our older generation must live in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution led by young people. From 2015, the era of the 4th industrial revolution, a production system based on cyber physical systems, began. The Internet of Things era is to create a flexible and efficient production system by connecting humans and machines. Convenience, diversity and originality are the most important spirits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. How can Buddhism contribute to humans seeking convenience through concentration and reflection? Buddhism easily embraces a diversity that acknowledges everything. Buddhists will be able to lead and live the 4th Industrial Revolution easily. The core of the 4th industry is machine and human, but it is based on meditation such as concentration and reflection. The life of Buddhists can be harmonized with the 4th Industrial Revolution and live in harmony with the organization and society. The main core technologies that lead the 4th industrial revolution are physics, digital, and biology. Physics is connected to unmanned transportation, robotics, 3D printing, and new materials. Digital is connected to the Internet of Things and blockchain. Biology is linked to genetics, gene editing, and synthetic biology. The national safety management paradigm is also changing by the 4th industrial revolution. So far, the national safety 1.0 system is the center of disaster acceptance and recovery. Responding to disasters, the national safety 2.0 system is the focus of on-site response. The national safety that prepares for disaster preparedness based on ICT is version 3.0. In the future, it is not a disaster caused by disaster prevention, but rather a disaster that will occur in the future. The future system is to comprehensively manage disaster risk for each process such as prediction, risk assessment, and reduction activities. In terms of our health, it is the same as the 3.0 version of National Safety. Until now, the disease had to appear to treat the disease, but in the future, it will go to a paradigm that prevents the disease and leads a healthy life that does not lead to illness."
"Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in women’s health nursing",2020,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Big data', 'Computer neural networks', 'Deep learning', 'Nursing']",,"Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning has been introduced to nursing care in recent years. The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice."

EER-ASSL: Combining Rollback Learning and Deep Learning for Rapid Adaptive Object Detection,2020,"['Object Detection', 'Active Learning', 'Semi-Supervised Learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network']",,"We propose a rapid adaptive learning framework for streaming object detection, called EER-ASSL. The method combines the expected error reduction (EER) dependent rollback learning and the active semi-supervised learning (ASSL) for a rapid adaptive CNN detector. Most CNN object detectors are built on the assumption of static data distribution. However, images are often noisy and biased, and the data distribution is imbalanced in a real world environment. The proposed method consists of collaborative sampling and EER-ASSL. The EER-ASSL utilizes the active learning (AL) and rollback based semi-supervised learning (SSL). The AL allows us to select more informative and representative samples measuring uncertainty and diversity. The SSL divides the selected streaming image samples into the bins and each bin repeatedly transfers the discriminative knowledge of the EER and CNN models to the next bin until convergence and incorporation with the EER rollback learning algorithm is achieved. The EER models provide a rapid short-term myopic adaptation and the CNN models an incremental long-term performance improvement. EER-ASSL can overcome noisy and biased labels in varying data distribution. Extensive experiments shows that EER-ASSL obtained 70.9 mAP compared to state-of-the-art technology such as Faster RCNN, SSD300, and YOLOv2."
Empirical Comparison of Deep Learning Networks on Backbone Method of Human Pose Estimation,2020,"['Deep learning', 'human pose estimation', 'CNN', 'VGG', 'Resnet']",,"Accurate estimation of human pose relies on backbone method in which its role is to extract feature map. Up to dated, the method of backbone feature extraction is conducted by the plain convolutional neural networks named by CNN and the residual neural networks named by Resnet, both of which have various architectures and performances. The CNN family network such as VGG which is well-known as a multiple stacked hidden layers architecture of deep learning methods, is base and simple while Resnet which is a bottleneck layers architecture yields fewer parameters and outperform. They have achieved inspired results as a backbone network in human pose estimation. However, they were used then followed by different pose estimation networks named by pose parsing module. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comparison between the plain CNN family network (VGG) and bottleneck network (Resnet) as a backbone method in the same pose parsing module. We investigate their performances such as number of parameters, loss score, precision and recall. We experiment them in the bottom-up method of human pose estimation system by adapted the pose parsing module of openpose. Our experimental results show that the backbone method using VGG network outperforms the Resent network with fewer parameter, lower loss score and higher accuracy of precision and recall."

This study proposes a target recognition method which differs from the existing surveillance reconnaissance systems. This method consists in distinguishing between ordinary people and targets by classifying motions in the images being filmed. Thus, the skeleton data of the target in the image are extracted using OpenPose. Then, keypoints included in the extracted skeleton data are entered into DNN, CNN, and LSTM to classify the motion. The classified motions are selected as motions learned in the military, such as overall security. When the system classifies motions and recognizes targets, it identifies them on the map and tracks them. The tracking algorithm calculates the movement direction of the target by calculating the change in the values of keypoints extracted through OpenPose by frames. Finally, it uses the depth information obtained from the camera to display targets on the map based on the camera location. All these computations are based on the use of the skeleton data rather than the entire image, thus reducing the overall computation."
Robust URL Phishing Detection Based on Deep Learning,2020,"['Phishing Detection', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'CNN', 'Cyber Security']",,"Phishing websites can have devastating effects on governmental, financial, and social services, as well as on individual privacy. Currently, many phishing detection solutions are evaluated using small datasets and, thus, are prone to sampling issues, such as representing legitimate websites by only high-ranking websites, which could make their evaluation less relevant in practice. Phishing detection solutions which depend only on the URL are attractive, as they can be used in limited systems, such as with firewalls. In this paper, we present a URL-only phishing detection solution based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The proposed CNN takes the URL as the input, rather than using predetermined features such as URL length. For training and evaluation, we have collected over two million URLs in a massive URL phishing detection (MUPD) dataset. We split MUPD into training, validation and testing datasets. The proposed CNN achieves approximately 96% accuracy on the testing dataset; this accuracy is achieved with URL schemes (such as HTTP and HTTPS) removed from the URL. Our proposed solution achieved better accuracy compared to an existing state-of-the-art URL-only model on a published dataset. Finally, the results of our experiment suggest keeping the CNN up-to-date for better results in practice."

Comparison of Deep-Learning Algorithms for the Detection of Railroad Pedestrians,2020,"['Deep-learning', 'MobileNet', 'Pedestrian railroad accident']",,"Railway transportation is the main land-based transportation in most countries. Accordingly, railway-transportation safety has always been a key issue for many researchers. Railway pedestrian accidents are the main reasons of railway-transportation casualties. In this study, we conduct experiments to determine which of the latest convolutional neural network models and algorithms are appropriate to build pedestrian railroad accident prevention systems. When a drone cruises over a pre-specified path and altitude, the real-time status around the rail is recorded, following which the image information is transmitted back to the server in time. Subsequently, the images are analyzed to determine whether pedestrians are present around the railroads, and a speed-deceleration order is immediately sent to the train driver, resulting in a reduction of the instances of pedestrian railroad accidents. This is the first part of an envisioned drone-based intelligent security system. This system can effectively address the problem of insufficient manual police force."
Improving accuracy of land surface temperature prediction model based on deep-learning,2020,"['AWS', 'Land surface temperature', 'Deep multilayer perceptron', 'Feature engineering', 'Downscaling']",,"Land surface temperature (LST) data is essential for urban engineering as well as modeling the atmospheric phenomena. Such modeling efforts require accurate temperature prediction which is then used for predicting other meteorological phenomena such as urban heat island and fine dust air pollution. The automatic weather system (AWS) provides accurate temperature with high frequency but it cannot grasp spatially continuous distribution in detail because it is collected only at specific points. On the contrary, the LST data obtained from satellite imagery has a high spatial resolution and spatially continuous temperature can be grasped, but it is difficult to get high temporal frequency temperature data because of its revisit time. In this study, to solve this spatio-temporal tradeoff problem, a deep-learning method was used to create a spatially continuous temperature image using AWS data with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The seasonal temperature was predicted with accuracy of 3.6 ℃ for spring, 1.9 ℃ for summer, 3 ℃ for fall, and 1.4 ℃ for winter. The predicted temperature accuracy for spatial resolution of 30 m is better than other reported interpolation methods. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of the model, fine tuning procedures were applied to the deep learning model hyper parameters as well as the input feature data."

Automated Segmentation of Left Ventricular Myocardium on Cardiac Computed Tomography Using Deep Learning,2020,"['Segmentation', 'Left ventricle', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Computed tomography']",,"Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of a deep learning-based automated segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) myocardium using cardiac CT.Materials and Methods: To develop a fully automated algorithm, 100 subjects with coronary artery disease were randomly selected as a development set (50 training / 20 validation / 30 internal test). An experienced cardiac radiologist generated the manual segmentation of the development set. The trained model was evaluated using 1000 validation set generated by an experienced technician. Visual assessment was performed to compare the manual and automatic segmentations. In a quantitative analysis, sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to the number of pixels where two three-dimensional masks of the manual and deep learning segmentations overlapped. Similarity indices, such as the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), were used to evaluate the margin of each segmented masks.Results: The sensitivity and specificity of automated segmentation for each segment (1–16 segments) were high (85.5– 100.0%). The DSC was 88.3 ± 6.2%. Among randomly selected 100 cases, all manual segmentation and deep learning masks for visual analysis were classified as very accurate to mostly accurate and there were no inaccurate cases (manual vs. deep learning: very accurate, 31 vs. 53; accurate, 64 vs. 39; mostly accurate, 15 vs. 8). The number of very accurate cases for deep learning masks was greater than that for manually segmented masks.Conclusion: We present deep learning-based automatic segmentation of the LV myocardium and the results are comparable to manual segmentation data with high sensitivity, specificity, and high similarity scores."

Application of Deep Learning to Missing Data Imputation: A Case Study of Highway Traffic in South Korea,2020,"['Deep learning', 'LSTM', 'traffic data imputation', 'Highway']",,"PURPOSES : Despite the availability of larger traffic data and more advanced data collection methods, the problem of missing data is yet to be solved. Imputing missing data to ensure data quality and reliability of statistics has always been challenging. Missing data are imputed via several existing methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average, exponential smoothing, and interpolation. However, these methods are complicated and results in significant errors. METHODS : A deep-learning method was applied in this study to impute traffic volume data of the South Korean national highway. Traffic data were trained using the long short-term memory method, which is a suitable deep-learning method for time series analysis. RESULTS : Three cases were proposed to estimate the traffic volume. In the first case, which represented the general conditions, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 12.7%. The second estimation case, which was based on the opposite traffic flow, exhibited a MAPE of 17%~18%. The third case, which was estimated using adjacent-section data, had a MAPE of 18.2%.

Deep learning-based extraction of predicate-argument structure (PAS) in building design rule sentences,2020,"['automated rule checking', 'building information modeling (BIM)', 'natural language processing (NLP)', 'predicate argument structure']",,"This paper describes an approach to extracting a predicate-argument structure (PAS) in building design rule sentences using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning models. For the computer to reason about the compliance of building design, design rules represented by natural language must be converted into a computer-readable format. The rule interpretation and translation processes are challenging tasks because of the vagueness and ambiguity of natural language.Many studies have proposed approaches to address this problem, but most of these are dependent on manual tasks, which is the bottleneck to expanding the scope of design rule checking to design requirements from various documents. In this paper, we apply deep learning-based NLP techniques for translating design rule sentences into a computer-readable data structure. To apply deep learning-based NLP techniques to the rule interpretation process, we identified the semantic role elements of building design requirements and defined a PAS for design rule checking. Using a bidirectional long short-term memory model with a conditional random field layer, the computer can intelligently analyze constituents of building design rule sentences and automatically extract the logical elements. The proposed approach contributes to broadening the scope of building information modeling-enabled rule checking to any natural language-based design requirements."

"딥 러닝(Deep learning)기반 동영상 처리 알고리즘을 통한 19대 대선 TV토론 영상분석 : 후보자들의 등장빈도, 표정, 응시방향에 대한 분석",2020,"['Presidential TV debate', 'Artificial intelligence video analysis', 'Mixed model analysis', 'Facial expression classification algorithm', 'Politicians direction of gaze', '대선 TV토론', '인공지능 영상분석', '다층모형분석', '표정분류 알고리즘', '정치인의 응시방향']",,"This study analyzed the frequency of appearance and nonverbal messages of political candidates in the television debates for the 19th presidential election held in 2017. To analyze nonverbal messages, facial expressions (angry, irritated, satisfied, and neutral) and the direction of gaze in the six televison debates, a classification network was constructed using deep learning technology. For this analysis, videos of six television debates held for 120 minutes per episode were collected, and image data was extracted at the rate of 30 frames per second as a frame, which resulted in image data of approximately 1.25 million frames. After that, this study built an image-analyzing system through deep learning, which automatically recognizes and classifies candidates appearing in videos, and then analyzes video frames by their facial expressions and direction of gaze. Then, the system counts how often each candidate appeared during all television debates in seconds, and analyzes the proportion of facial expressions of the candidates during the entire television debates. The results showed that Sang-Jung Shim appeared the most over three debates, followed by Chul-soo Ahn in two debates and Jae-in Moon in one. The least appeared candidate was Jun-pyo Hong. As for the facial expression, Moon showed the most satisfactory facial expressions, and Seung-min Yoo expressed his emotion the least. Hong showed the irritated expression the most, indicating that he had difficulty managing his facial expression. Additionally, this study conducted a multi-level analysis combining the image data with a panel survey, which measured respondents preference of candidates before and after the presidential campaign, and the number of times they watched the debates. The multi-level analysis confirmed that the preferences of the candidates changed depending on the exposure to the facial expressions made by the candidates in the actual televison debates. As for the satisfactory expression and the expressionless face, the candidates were evaluated more positively as the expression exposure increased. In the case of the angry expression, the degree of candidate favorability decreased after the exposure. These results suggest that the viewers’ evaluations of the candidates changed substantially according to the candidates facial expressions in the debate. In an era where communication scholars are expanding their research areas by converging with new disciplines such as media engineering and data science, this study suggests a new research direction. We hope that this study lays the groundwork for the research on media analysis using algorithms and deep learning."

A commercialized deep learning-based CAD system that can identify various abnormalities on CXR was implemented for the interpretation of CXR in daily practice. The diagnostic performance of radiologists with CAD assistance were evaluated based on two different reference standards: 1) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results for COVID-19 and 2) pulmonary abnormality suggesting pneumonia on chest CT. The turnaround times (TATs) of radiology reports for CXR and rRT-PCR results were also evaluated.Results: Among 332 patients (male:female, 173:159; mean age, 57 years) with available rRT-PCR results, 16 patients (4.8%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Using CXR, radiologists with CAD assistance identified rRT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients with sensitivity and specificity of 68.8% and 66.7%, respectively. Among 119 patients (male:female, 75:44; mean age, 69 years) with available chest CTs, radiologists assisted by CAD reported pneumonia on CXR with a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 72.3%. The TATs of CXR reports were significantly shorter than those of rRT-PCR results (median 51 vs. 507 minutes; p < 0.001).Conclusion: Radiologists with CAD assistance could identify patients with rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 or pneumonia on CXR with a reasonably acceptable performance. In patients suspected with COVID-19, CXR had much faster TATs than rRT-PCRs."
Assessment of a Deep Learning Algorithm for the Detection of Rib Fractures on Whole-Body Trauma Computed Tomography,2020,"['Rib fractures', 'Trauma', 'Deep learning', 'Computer-assisted image interpretation', 'Computed tomography']",,"Objective: To assess the diagnostic performance of a deep learning-based algorithm for automated detection of acute and chronic rib fractures on whole-body trauma CT.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively identified all whole-body trauma CT scans referred from the emergency department of our hospital from January to December 2018 (n = 511). Scans were categorized as positive (n = 159) or negative (n = 352) for rib fractures according to the clinically approved written CT reports, which served as the index test. The bone kernel series (1.5-mm slice thickness) served as an input for a detection prototype algorithm trained to detect both acute and chronic rib fractures based on a deep convolutional neural network. It had previously been trained on an independent sample from eight other institutions (n = 11455).Results: All CTs except one were successfully processed (510/511). The algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 87.4% and specificity of 91.5% on a per-examination level [per CT scan: rib fracture(s): yes/no]. There were 0.16 false-positives per examination (= 81/510). On a per-finding level, there were 587 true-positive findings (sensitivity: 65.7%) and 307 false-negatives. Furthermore, 97 true rib fractures were detected that were not mentioned in the written CT reports. A major factor associated with correct detection was displacement.Conclusion: We found good performance of a deep learning-based prototype algorithm detecting rib fractures on trauma CT on a per-examination level at a low rate of false-positives per case. A potential area for clinical application is its use as a screening tool to avoid false-negative radiology reports."

Feasibility of fully automated classification of whole slide images based on deep learning,2020,"['Computational pathology', 'Computer-aided diagnosis', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Digital pathology']",,"Although microscopic analysis of tissue slides has been the basis for disease diagnosis for decades, intra- and inter-observer variabilities remain issues to be resolved. The recent introduction of digital scanners has allowed for using deep learning in the analysis of tissue images because many whole slide images (WSIs) are accessible to researchers. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of a deep learning-based, fully automated, computer-aided diagnosis system with WSIs from a stomach adenocarcinoma dataset. Three different convolutional neural network architectures were tested to determine the better architecture for tissue classifier. Each network was trained to classify small tissue patches into normal or tumor. Based on the patch-level classification, tumor probability heatmaps can be overlaid on tissue images. We observed three different tissue patterns, including clear normal, clear tumor and ambiguous cases. We suggest that longer inspection time can be assigned to ambiguous cases compared to clear normal cases, increasing the accuracy and efficiency of histopathologic diagnosis by pre-evaluating the status of the WSIs. When the classifier was tested with completely different WSI dataset, the performance was not optimal because of the different tissue preparation quality. By including a small amount of data from the new dataset for training, the performance for the new dataset was much enhanced. These results indicated that WSI dataset should include tissues prepared from many different preparation conditions to construct a generalized tissue classifier. Thus, multi-national/multi-center dataset should be built for the application of deep learning in the real world medical practice."

All included patients underwent CCTA with iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE level 3, Siemens Healthineers). We developed a deep learning based denoising technique (ClariCT.AI, ClariPI), which was based on a modified U-net type convolutional neural net model designed to predict the possible occurrence of low-dose noise in the originals. Denoised images were obtained by subtracting the predicted noise from the originals. Image noise, CT attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were objectively calculated. The edge rise distance (ERD) was measured as an indicator of image sharpness. Two blinded readers subjectively graded the image quality using a 5-point scale. Diagnostic performance of the CCTA was evaluated based on the presence or absence of significant stenosis (≥ 50% lumen reduction).Results: Objective image qualities (original vs. denoised: image noise, 67.22 ± 25.74 vs. 52.64 ± 27.40; SNR [left main], 21.91 ± 6.38 vs. 30.35 ± 10.46; CNR [left main], 23.24 ± 6.52 vs. 31.93 ± 10.72; all p < 0.001) and subjective image quality (2.45 ± 0.62 vs. 3.65 ± 0.60, p < 0.001) improved significantly in the denoised images. The average ERDs of the denoised images were significantly smaller than those of originals (0.98 ± 0.08 vs. 0.09 ± 0.08, p < 0.001). With regard to diagnostic accuracy, no significant differences were observed among paired comparisons.Conclusion: Application of the deep learning technique along with iterative reconstruction can enhance the noise reduction performance with a significant improvement in objective and subjective image qualities of CCTA images."

First, specious answers were suggested in those studies because the probability distributions of answer candidates were calculated even if the actual answer did not exist within the group. Second, when there were more than two entities in an image, only a single entity was focused on. We applied an object detection algorithm (YOLO) to resolve these problems.

Low-Dose Abdominal CT Using a Deep Learning-Based Denoising Algorithm: A Comparison with CT Reconstructed with Filtered Back Projection or Iterative Reconstruction Algorithm,2020,"['Deep learning', 'Denoising', 'Iterative reconstruction', 'CT', 'Phantoms', 'Radiation dose']",,"Objective: To compare the image quality of low-dose (LD) computed tomography (CT) obtained using a deep learning-based denoising algorithm (DLA) with LD CT images reconstructed with a filtered back projection (FBP) and advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE).Materials and Methods: One hundred routine-dose (RD) abdominal CT studies reconstructed using FBP were used to train the DLA. Simulated CT images were made at dose levels of 13%, 25%, and 50% of the RD (DLA-1, -2, and -3) and reconstructed using FBP. We trained DLAs using the simulated CT images as input data and the RD CT images as ground truth. To test the DLA, the American College of Radiology CT phantom was used together with 18 patients who underwent abdominal LD CT. LD CT images of the phantom and patients were processed using FBP, ADMIRE, and DLAs (LD-FBP, LD-ADMIRE, and LD-DLA images, respectively). To compare the image quality, we measured the noise power spectrum and modulation transfer function (MTF) of phantom images. For patient data, we measured the mean image noise and performed qualitative image analysis. We evaluated the presence of additional artifacts in the LD-DLA images.Results: LD-DLAs achieved lower noise levels than LD-FBP and LD-ADMIRE for both phantom and patient data (all p < 0.001). LD-DLAs trained with a lower radiation dose showed less image noise. However, the MTFs of the LD-DLAs were lower than those of LD-ADMIRE and LD-FBP (all p < 0.001) and decreased with decreasing training image dose. In the qualitative image analysis, the overall image quality of LD-DLAs was best for DLA-3 (50% simulated radiation dose) and not significantly different from LD-ADMIRE. There were no additional artifacts in LD-DLA images.Conclusion: DLAs achieved less noise than FBP and ADMIRE in LD CT images, but did not maintain spatial resolution. The DLA trained with 50% simulated radiation dose showed the best overall image quality."

Mobile network operators will need to collaborate tofulfill service requirements at scale.

In this paper, we propose an agent-based architecture,where establishment of collaboration for a given connectivityservice is done proactively, given predictions about future servicedemand. We build a simulation environment and evaluate ourapproach with a number of scenarios and in context of areal-world use case, and compare it with existing collaborationapproaches. Results show that by learning how to adapt theircollaboration strategy, operators can fulfill a greater part of theservice requirements than by providing the service independently,or through pre-established, intangible service level agreements."

Deep learning–based drone detection with SWIR cameras,2020,"['Drone', 'Anti-drone', 'YOLO', 'Object detection', 'Image processing', 'SWIR camera']",,"Small unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, and their related industries are improving in leaps and bounds. The global drone industry began with a military focus and subsequently progressed into commercial applications. Consequently, abuse cases linked to drone technology are gradually increasing. Following the technical advancement in drone technology, studies on drone detection and prevention are actively ongoing. This is one such study. Radar-based drone detection that combines various existing sensors or equipment has shortcomings, including high costs and specialist operations. Thus, this paper proposes a drone-detection system that uses only thermal images from short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) cameras. The YOLO model, which is widely used for object recognition, was used for the drone-detection algorithm. Labels were attached to 22,921 thermal images to test the constructed system; 16,121 images were used for training and the remainder for testing. The test results showed 98.17% precision and 98.65% recall.

Design of Falling Recognition Application System using Deep Learning,2020,"['Deep Learning', 'Smart Phone', 'Application', 'Falling Recognition System', 'DBaaS.']",,"Studies are being conducted regarding falling recognition using sensors on smartphones to recognize falling in human daily life. These studies use a number of sensors, mostly acceleration sensors, gyro sensors, motion sensors, etc. Falling recognition system processes the values of sensor data by using a falling recognition algorithm and classifies behavior based on thresholds. If the threshold is ambiguous, the accuracy will be reduced. To solve this problem, Deep learning was introduced in the behavioral recognition system. Deep learning is a kind of machine learning technique that computers process and categorize input data rather than processing it by man-made algorithms. Thus, in this paper, we propose a falling recognition application system using deep learning based on smartphones. The proposed system is powered by apps on smartphones.

The controlled items, composed of 210 sentences, are categorized into two types: well-formedness test (i.e., no syntactic violation) and plausibility (i.e., no awkwardness) test items, most of which are excerpted from precedent linguistics literature. The deep learning model and five English native speakers are asked to classify the nativeness of the same stimulus sentences and the results reveal differences and similarities between them; although the overall performance of humans overwhelms that of deep learning, they are quite similar in judging plausibility items and learner data. The length of response time―hanging back from decision of nativeness―does not guarantee the accuracy, which means judging nativeness depends on something like intuition rather than deliberation."

Deep Contour Recovery: Repairing Breaks in Detected Contours using Deep Learning,2020,"['Contour recovery', 'Contour detection', 'Deep learning', 'CNN', 'Residual connections training']",,"We present a contour recovery framework based on a deep learning model to connect broken contours (breaks) produced by contour detection methods. The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods."

The application areas of DL in radiation oncology include classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, image translation and generation, and image captioning. This article tries to understand what is the potential role of DL and what can be more achieved by utilizing it in radiation oncology.

Development of Fault Detection and Identification Algorithm Using Deep learning for Nanosatellite Attitude Control System,2020,['Deep learning · Nanosatellite · Fault detection · Fault identifi cation · Reaction wheel'],,"Satellites should have high reliability because they are required to operate autonomously, while performing a given mission. To realize this, it is necessary to use heritage parts or include redundancy. However, for nanosatellites, where it is difficult to include redundancy due to volume and weight limitations, fault management becomes crucial. In this study, a new method based on deep learning is proposed for detecting and identifying the faults in the reaction wheel, which is one of the satellite actuators. A deep learning model is applied to learn the fault and fault type using the residual between the measured attitude data and the estimated attitude date. In this study, it is assumed that three reaction wheels are installed, and fault detection is designed accordingly. The proposed model enables the satellite to detect faults autonomously, even when it is not communicating with the ground station, and is expected to be highly beneficial for the autonomous operation of the mega-constellation mission using nanosatellite that is to be activated in future."

Deeplearning method has proved to be a viable approach in a number of application domains. It is also gaining wider groundsin medical image analysis. A cascaded structure of layers can be trained to mimic the image-based cognitive and inferenceprocesses of human and other higher organisms. We employed a set of well known deep learning network architectures. Inthe current study, 3000 images were manually curated to mark feature points on hands. They were used as reference pointsin removing unnecessary image regions and to retain regions of interest (ROI) relevant to age estimation. Diff erent ROI’swere defi ned and used—that of rather small area mostly made up of carpal and metacarpal bones and that includes most ofphalanges in addition. Irrelevant intensity variation across cropped images was minimized by applying histogram equalization.In consideration of the established gender diff erence in growth rates, separate gender models were built. Certain agerange image data are far scarcer and exhibit rather large excursion in morphology from other age ranges—e.g. infancy andvery early childhood. Many studies excluded them and addressed only elder subjects in later developmental stages. Consideringinfant age group’s diagnosis demand is just as valid as elder groups’, we included entire age ranges for our study.A number of diff erent deep learning architectures were trained with varying region of interest defi nitions. Smallest meanabsolute diff erence error was 8.890 months for a test set of 400 images. This study was preliminary, and in the future, weplan to investigate alternative approaches not taken in the present study."

A Study of Video-Based Abnormal Behavior Recognition Model Using Deep Learning,2020,"['Behavior Recognition', 'Deep Learning', 'CNN-LSTM', '3D CNN', 'I3D']",,"Recently, CCTV installations are rapidly increasing in the public and private sectors to prevent various crimes. In accordance with the increasing number of CCTVs, video-based abnormal behavior detection in control systems is one of the key technologies for safety. This is because it is difficult for the surveillance personnel who control multiple CCTVs to manually monitor all abnormal behaviors in the video. In order to solve this problem, research to recognize abnormal behavior using deep learning is being actively conducted. In this paper, we propose a model for detecting abnormal behavior based on the deep learning model that is currently widely used. Based on the abnormal behavior video data provided by AI Hub, we performed a comparative experiment to detect anomalous behavior through violence learning and fainting in videos using 2D CNN-LSTM, 3D CNN, and I3D models. We hope that the experimental results of this abnormal behavior learning model will be helpful in developing intelligent CCTV."

EGR PREDICTION OF DIESEL ENGINES IN STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS USING DEEP LEARNING METHOD,2020,"['Diesel engines', 'DNN (Deep neural network)', 'EGR', 'EGR prediction model', 'Prediction in steady-state', 'Deep learning']",,"Most of the parameters needed to predict Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions, for example, combustion temperature, oxygen concentration and in-cylinder composition ratio, can be predicted by phenomenological 0-D prediction model if accurate EGR rates are provided. However, it is difficult to predict the EGR rate itself accurately by the model, so the EGR rate is predicted by the temperature measurement method. Although this method predicts EGR rates very accurately and quickly, there are some problems such as thermocouple failures and the difficulty in applying to mass production engines, so it is necessary to predict EGR rates by another method. The deep learning method follows an inductive methodology that extracts common characteristics of data based on a lot of data themselves. Therefore, although it requires a lot of experimental data, it has an advantage of high accuracy that can be obtained without any feature engineering. In this study, the EGR rate, which was difficult to predict in the past, was predicted by making various models using the deep learning method. Finally, EGR rate was predicted with a high accuracy of R-square 0.9994 and root mean squared error 0.0692 using a deep learning method at 1500 rpm and bmep 4, 6 and 8 bar. This study can be used as a basic study to predict EGR rates in transient and RDE conditions."
Mobile sensor based human activity recognition: distinguishing of challenging activities by applying long short-term memory deep learning modified by residual network concept,2020,['Human activity recognition · Mobile sensor · Deep learning · Convolutional neural networks · Long short-term memory · Residual networks'],,"Automated recognition of daily human tasks is a novel method for continuous monitoring of the health of elderly people.Nowadays mobile devices (i.e. smartphone and smartwatch) are equipped with a variety of sensors, therefore activity classification algorithms have become as useful, low-cost, and non-invasive diagnostic modality to implement as mobile software.The aim of this article is to introduce a new deep learning structure for recognizing challenging (i.e. similar) humanactivities based on signals which have been recorded by sensors mounted on mobile devices. In the proposed structure, theresidual network concept is engaged as a new substructure inside the main proposed structure. This part is responsible toaddress the problem of accuracy saturation in convolutional neural networks, thanks to its ability in jump over some layerswhich leads to reducing vanishing gradients eff ect. Therefore the accuracy of the classifi cation of several activities isincreased by using the proposed structure. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated on real life recorded signalsand is compared with existing techniques in two diff erent scenarios. The proposed structure is applied on two well-knownhuman activity datasets that have been prepared in university of Fordham. The fi rst dataset contains the recorded signalswhich arise from six diff erent activities including walking, jogging, upstairs, downstairs, sitting, and standing. The seconddataset also contains walking, jogging, stairs, sitting, standing, eating soup, eating sandwich, and eating chips. In the fi rstscenario, the performance of the proposed structures is compared with deep learning schemes. The obtained results show thatthe proposed method may improve the recognition rate at least 5% for the fi rst dataset against its own family alternatives indistinguishing challenging activities (i.e. downstairs and upstairs). For the second data set similar improvements is obtainedfor some challenging activities (i.e. eating sandwich and eating chips). These superiorities even reach to at least 28% whenthe capability of the proposed method in recognizing downstairs and upstairs is compared to its non-family methods for thefi rst dataset. Increasing the recognition rate of the proposed method for challenging activities (i.e. downstairs and upstairs,eating sandwich and eating chips) in parallel with its acceptable performance for other non-challenging activities shows itseff ectiveness in mobile sensor-based health monitoring systems."

To utilize a wide range of network options properly andmake decisions more intelligently, the mobile devices should be ableto understand networks’ situations autonomously. The current mobile devices have powerful computing power and are able to collectvarious network information, and people nowadays almost alwayscarry their mobile devices. Thus, the mobile devices can be utilized to figure out practical quality of service/experience and inferthe network situation/context. However, networks have become notonly larger but also more complex and dynamic than in the past,so it is hard to devise models, algorithms, or system platforms formobile devices to understand such complex and diverse networks.To overcome this limitation, we leverage deep learning to devise amobile device-centric approach to identifying problem spot havingthe most likely cause of network quality degradation, MoNPI. Byusing MoNPI, mobile devices are able to identify the network problem spot, which is like a black box to end nodes heretofore. Mobiledevices with MoNPI are able to understand networks’ situationsand thus take a more proper action."

PD is a chronic and progressive nervous system disorder that aff ectsbody movement. PD is assessed by using the unifi ed Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS). In this paper, fi rstly, principalcomponent analysis (PCA) is employed to the featured dataset to address the multicollinearity problems in the dataset andto reduce the dimension of input feature space. Then, the reduced input feature space is fed into the proposed DNN modelwith a tuned parameter norm penalty (L2) and analyses the prediction performance of it in PD progression by predictingMotor and Total-UPDRS score.

Although computed tomography (CT) volumetry is considered to be the most reliable noninvasive method for liver and spleen volume measurement, it has limited application in clinical practice due to its time-consuming segmentation process. We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning algorithm (DLA) for fully automated liver and spleen segmentation using portal venous phase CT images in various liver conditions.Materials and Methods: A DLA for liver and spleen segmentation was trained using a development dataset of portal venous CT images from 813 patients.

In this paper, we present a novel multimodalrecognition system that trains a deep learning network to automatically learn features after extracting multiplebiometric modalities from a single data source, i.e., facial video clips. Utilizing different modalities, i.e., leftear, left profile face, frontal face, right profile face, and right ear, present in the facial video clips, we trainsupervised denoising auto-encoders to automatically extract robust and non-redundant features. The automaticallylearned features are then used to train modality specific sparse classifiers to perform the multimodalrecognition. Moreover, the proposed technique has proven robust when some of the above modalities weremissing during the testing. The proposed system has three main components that are responsible for detection,which consists of modality specific detectors to automatically detect images of different modalities present infacial video clips; feature selection, which uses supervised denoising sparse auto-encoders network to capturediscriminative representations that are robust to the illumination and pose variations; and classification, whichconsists of a set of modality specific sparse representation classifiers for unimodal recognition, followed byscore level fusion of the recognition results of the available modalities. Experiments conducted on theconstrained facial video dataset (WVU) and the unconstrained facial video dataset (HONDA/UCSD), resultedin a 99.17% and 97.14% Rank-1 recognition rates, respectively.

Review on the Usage of Deep Learning Models in Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis,2020,"['Sentiment analysis', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Opinion mining']",,"In recent years, Sentiment Analysis is reshaping the business operations of many organizations by monitoring their brand reputation on social media and acquiring insights from customer""s feedback. Sentiment Analysis is one of the classification tools that identifies and extracts the subjective information of a product. This subjective information can be stated in different ways, such as feedback, discussions, blogs, podcasts, and video logs. This type of information generated by the empowered customers is known as user-generated content, which is traditionally in the form of words. The analysis was performed on a huge number of words using Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is a Unimodal Sentiment Analysis. With the rapid growth in the usage of the Internet, social media turned out to be a platform to share the thoughts of the individuals. This caused researchers to migrate from the traditional Unimodal analysis to Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, which includes video, audio, and images. This approach leverages the use of emotion and content and helps identify the scope and polarity of an individual’s sentiment. With the latest deep learning algorithms, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis can solve the problem of sarcasm identification. Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis generates more accurate results compared to Uni Modal Sentiment Analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to define Sentiment Analysis and review the approaches and techniques in Sentiment Analysis from conventional Unimodal to Multimodal. In addition, this paper discusses a Multimodal Sentiment Analysis architecture using a transformers attention net."

HPAI outbreaks on 544 poultry farms (307 with H5N6, and 237 with H5N8) that had available visit records of livestock-related vehicles amongst the 812 HPAI outbreaks that were confirmed between January 2014 and June 2017 were involved in this study.Results After 140,000 iterations without drop-out, a model with 3 hidden layers and 10 nodes per layer, were selected. The activation function of the model was hyperbolic tangent. Precision and recall of the test gave F1 measures of 0.41, 0.68 and 0.51, respectively, at validation. The predicted risk values were higher for the “outbreak” (average ± SD, 0.20 ± 0.31) than “non-outbreak” (0.18 ± 0.30) farms (p < 0.001).Conclusion The risk assessment model developed was employed during the epidemics of 2016/2017 (pilot version) and 2017/2018 (complementary version). This risk assessment model enhanced risk management activities by enabling preemptive control measures to prevent the spread of diseases."

An accelerating Rindler observer in a flat spacetime sees quantum fields that have a thermal distribution from  quantum entanglement. For the observer a renormalization group (RG) process for the thermal fields on a lattice is similar to a deep Boltzmann network. This correspondence can be generalized for the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states of quantum fields in a curved spacetime like that around a black hole."

Segmentation of Multi‑Modal MRI Brain Tumor Sub‑Regions Using Deep Learning,2020,['Automatic brain tumor segmentation · CNN · Deep learning · Enhancing tumor · MRI brain tumor image processing · Sub regions of brain tumor segmentation'],,"In medical imaging, extraction of brain tumor region in the magnetic resonance image (MRI) is not sufcient, but fnding the tumor extension is necessary to plan best treatment to improve the survival rate as it depends on tumor’s size, location, and patient’s age. Manually extracting the brain tumor sub-regions from MRI volume is tedious, time consuming and the inherently complex brain tumor images requires a profcient radiologist. Thus, a reliable multi-modal deep learning models are proposed for automatic segmentation to extract the sub-regions like enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). These models are constructed on the basis of U-net and VGG16 architectures. The whole tumor is obtained by segmenting T2-weighted images and cross-check the edema’s extension in T2 fuid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR).ET and TC are both extracted by evaluating the hyper-intensities in T1-weighted contrast enhanced images. The proposed method has produced better results in terms of dice similarity index, Jaccard similarity index, accuracy, specifcity, and sensitivity for segmented sub regions. The experimental results on BraTS 2018 database shows the proposed DL model outperforms with average dice coefcients of 0.91521, 0.92811, 0.96702, and Jaccard coefcients of 0.84715, 0.88357, 0.93741 for ET, TC, and WT respectively"

Detection of Dangerous Situations using Deep Learning Model with Relational Inference,2020,"['Closed-circuit television', 'Crime', 'Danger detection', 'Smart cities']",,"Crime has become one of the major problems in modern society. Even though visual surveillances through closed-circuit television (CCTV) is extensively used for solving crime, the number of crimes has not decreased. This is because there is insufficient workforce for performing 24-hour surveillance. In addition, CCTV surveillance by humans is not efficient for detecting dangerous situations owing to accuracy issues. In this paper, we propose the autonomous detection of dangerous situations in CCTV scenes using a deep learning model with relational inference. The main feature of the proposed method is that it can simultaneously perform object detection and relational inference to determine the danger of the situations captured by CCTV. This enables us to efficiently classify dangerous situations by inferring the relationship between detected objects (i.e., distance and position). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of the accuracy of image classification and the false alarm rate even when object detection accuracy is low."
A Sketch-based 3D Object Retrieval Approach for Augmented Reality Models Using Deep Learning,2020,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'object retrieval', 'Deep Learning', 'Sketch-based 3D object retrieval', 'Augmented Reality']",,"Retrieving a 3D model from a 3D database and augmenting the retrieved model in the Augmented Reality system simultaneously became an issue in developing the plausible AR environments in a convenient fashion. It is considered that the sketch-based 3D object retrieval is an intuitive way for searching 3D objects based on human-drawn sketches as query. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based approach of retrieving a sketch-based 3D object as for an Augmented Reality Model. For this work, we introduce a new method which uses Sketch CNN, Wasserstein CNN and Wasserstein center loss for retrieving a sketch-based 3D object. Especially, Wasserstein center loss is used for learning the center of each object category and reducing the Wasserstein distance between center and features of the same category. The proposed 3D object retrieval and augmentation consist of three major steps as follows. Firstly, Wasserstein CNN extracts 2D images taken from various directions of 3D object using CNN, and extracts features of 3D data by computing the Wasserstein barycenters of features of each image. Secondly, the features of the sketch are extracted using a separate Sketch CNN. Finally, we adopt sketch-based object matching method to localize the natural marker of the images to register a 3D virtual object in AR system. Using the detected marker, the retrieved 3D virtual object is augmented in AR system automatically. By the experiments, we prove that the proposed method is efficiency for retrieving and augmenting objects."

QoS Provisioning and Energy Saving Scheme for Distributed Cognitive Radio Networks Using Deep Learning,2020,"['Bipartite matching', 'cognitive radio networks', 'deep learning', 'energy saving', 'mean slowdown', 'quality of service', 'resource allocation', 'resource percentage threshold', 'traffic prediction.']",,"One of the major challenges facing the realization of cognitive radios (CRs) in future mobile and wireless communicationsis the issue of high energy consumption. Since future network infrastructure will host real-time services requiring immediate satisfaction, the issue of high energy consumption will hinder the fullrealization of CRs. This means that to offer the required qualityof service (QoS) in an energy-efficient manner, resource management strategies need to allow for effective trade-offs between QoSprovisioning and energy saving. To address this issue, this paperfocuses on single base station (BS) management, where resourceconsumption efficiency is obtained by solving a dynamic resourceallocation (RA) problem using bipartite matching. A deep learning(DL) predictive control scheme is used to predict the traffic loadfor better energy saving using a stacked auto-encoder (SAE). Considered here was a base station (BS) processor with both processorsharing (PS) and first-come-first-served (FCFS) sharing disciplinesunder quite general assumptions about the arrival and service processes. The workload arrivals are defined by a Markovian arrivalprocess while the service is general. The possible impatience of customers is taken into account in terms of the required delays. Inthis way, the BS processor is treated as a hybrid switching system that chooses a better packet scheduling scheme between meanslowdown (MS) FCFS and MS PS. The simulation results presentedin this paper indicate that the proposed predictive control schemeachieves better energy saving as the traffic load increases, and thatthe processing of workload using MS PS achieves substantially superior energy saving compared to MS FCFS."

We obtained institutional review board approval to utilize previous radiographs for the study and the radiograph images were used to train CNN architecture. The calculation experiment of a dataset of 136 images of the proximal femur to estimate CI and CC was performed using a trained CNN architecture (Automatic). Also, manual segmentation method (Manual) to calculate CI and CC was conducted using the standard protocol by two experts as a reference for the results comparison. The mean values of the Manual and Automatic calculation of CI for the proximal femur were 0.56 and 0.54, respectively, showing a statistically signifcant diference (p=0.035).Signifcant diference (p<0.001) was also seen in the calculation of CC by Manual and Automatic method resulting in 0.42 and 0.47, respectively. In addition, the automatic method showed far better results in terms of calculation speed (less than 30 s per single image). Therefore, we suggest that the manual method be carefully considered while planning a surgery."
Motion predictive control for DPS using predicted drifted ship position based on deep learning and replay buffer,2020,"['Dynamic Positioning System (DPS)', 'Motion predictive control', 'Ship motion prediction', 'Deep learning', 'Replay buffer']",,"Typically, a Dynamic Positioning System (DPS) uses a PID feed-back system, and it often adopts a wind feed-forward system because of its easier implementation than a feed-forward system based on current or wave.

Real-time Human Pose Estimation using RGB-D images and Deep Learning,2020,"['Human pose estimation', 'human skeleton tracking', 'keypoint localization', 'deep learning']",,"Human Pose Estimation (HPE) which localizes the human body joints becomes a high potential for high-level applications in the field of computer vision. The main challenges of HPE in real-time are occlusion, illumination change and diversity of pose appearance. The single RGB image is fed into HPE framework in order to reduce the computation cost by using depth-independent device such as a common camera, webcam, or phone cam. However, HPE based on the single RGB is not able to solve the above challenges due to inherent characteristics of color or texture. On the other hand, depth information which is fed into HPE framework and detects the human body parts in 3D coordinates can be usefully used to solve the above challenges. However, the depth information-based HPE requires the depth-dependent device which has space constraint and is cost consuming. Especially, the result of depth information-based HPE is less reliable due to the requirement of pose initialization and less stabilization of frame tracking. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method of HPE which is robust in estimating self-occlusion. There are many human parts which can be occluded by other body parts. However, this paper focuses only on head self-occlusion. The new method is a combination of the RGB image-based HPE framework and the depth information-based HPE framework. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method by COCO Object Keypoint Similarity library. By taking an advantage of RGB image-based HPE method and depth information-based HPE method, our HPE method based on RGB-D achieved the mAP of 0.903 and mAR of 0.938. It proved that our method outperforms the RGB-based HPE and the depth-based HPE."

However, since no rapid and accurate method for volumetry has been developed, volumetry has not yet been established in clinical practice, hindering the development of therapies for PKLD. This study presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-based volumetry method for PKLD.Materials and Methods: The performance of AI was first evaluated in comparison with ground-truth (GT). We trained a V-net-based convolutional neural network on 175 ADPKD computed tomography (CT) segmentations, which served as the GT and were agreed upon by 3 experts using images from 214 patients analyzed with volumetry. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC), interobserver correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland–Altman plots of 39 GT and AI segmentations in the validation set were compared. Next, the performance of AI on the segmentation of 50 random CT images was compared with that of 11 PKLD specialists based on the resulting DSC and ICC.Results: The DSC and ICC of the AI were 0.961 and 0.999729, respectively. The error rate was within 3% for approximately 95% of the CT scans (error<1%, 46.2%; 1%≤error<3%, 48.7%). Compared with the specialists, AI showed moderate performance. Furthermore, an outlier in our results confirmed that even PKLD specialists can make mistakes in volumetry.Conclusions: PKLD volumetry using AI was fast and accurate. AI performed comparably to human specialists, suggesting its use may be practical in clinical settings."

However, there is a limited amoun of research yet based on algorithms using panoramic radiography. This study was conducted to find the standard AI reading that distinguishes the young from the elderly using panoramic radiographic images, and to confirm the applicability of the method as a means of increasing the reliability of a diagnosis. A total of 117 panoramas in A dental clinic were used. The selected radiographic images were classified into two groups: the old group and the young group. To load the classified images into the suggested and designed multi-layer neural network model (modified DarkNet), they were split into 70 % training data and 30 % testing data using the ‘SplitEachLable()’ Matlab function. To identify the old group, the focal class activation mapping or CAM (the height of the alveolar bone and the major places where other treatment actions took place) area was estimated. To identify the young group, a wide CAM area over the entire area was estimated as a feature. These data could be important quantitative indicators of the health of the alveolar bone and of the overall dental condition. Significant results and features were derived to show the potential of quantitative indicators for dental care.

We detect body areas and key parts of a body through a pre-learned Mask R-CNN in the images captured by a camera. Then we find the centerline of the body through the joint points of both shoulders and feet. Also, we calculate an angle to the center line and then calculate the amount of change in the angle per hour. If the angle change is more than a certain value, then it is decided as a suspected fall. Also, if the suspected fall state persists for more than a certain frame, then it is determined as a fall situation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can detect body fall situation accurately."

In this study, we tried to find out the neural characteristics of self-regulation process consisting of assimilation, conflict and accommodation by analyzing subject’s brain activity using fNIRS. In addition to the brain activity, a deep learning model was also developed for the process prediction of self-regulation. Forty-six high-school students were administered to take a mirror task inducing self-regulation, and their brain activities were measured and analyzed using fNIRS. As a result, the activities of both OFC and left DLPFC were found in the entire process of self-regulation. It can be seen that the process of self-regulation is mainly based on monitoring and evaluation of one s performance. In addition, the activities of FP and VLPFC were additionally shown in the accommodation phase. These results are presumably proposed that the goal-oriented multitasking and clarification using language might be two of major players in this process. In addition, a predictive model was developed through a deep learning process with an accuracy of 72.8% and a loss value of 0.309.

Deep CNN based Pilot Allocation Scheme in Massive MIMO systems,2020,"['Deep Learning', 'CNN', 'MLP', 'pilot contamination', 'pilot assignment', 'massive MIMO', 'SIR']",,"This paper introduces a pilot allocation scheme for massive MIMO systems based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) learning. This work is an extension of a prior work on the basic deep learning framework of the pilot assignment problem, the application of which to a high-user density nature is difficult owing to the factorial increase in both input features and output layers. To solve this problem, by adopting the advantages of CNN in learning image data, we design input features that represent users’ locations in all the cells as image data with a two-dimensional fixed-size matrix. Furthermore, using a sorting mechanism for applying proper rule, we construct output layers with a linear space complexity according to the number of users. We also develop a theoretical framework for the network capacity model of the massive MIMO systems and apply it to the training process. Finally, we implement the proposed deep CNN-based pilot assignment scheme using a commercial vanilla CNN, which takes into account shift invariant characteristics. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed work realizes about a 98% theoretical upper-bound performance and an elapsed time of 0.842 ms with low complexity in the case of a high-user-density condition."

Defects on the surface of railroads are caused by various factors such as friction between track binding devices and adjacent tracks and can cause accidents such as broken rails [14], so railroad maintenance for defects is necessary. Therefore, various researches on defect detection and inspection using image processing or machine learning on railway surface images have been conducted to automate railroad inspection and to reduce railroad maintenance costs. In general, the performance of the image processing analysis method and machine learning technology is affected by the quantity and quality of data. For this reason, some researches require specific devices or vehicles to acquire images of the track surface at regular intervals to obtain a database of various railway surface images [15, 16]. On the contrary, in this study, in order to reduce and improve the operating cost of image acquisition, we constructed the 'Defective Railroad Surface Regeneration Model' by applying the methods presented in the related studies of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [1]. Thus, we aimed to detect defects on railroad surface even without a dedicated database. This constructed model is designed to learn to generate the railroad surface combining the different railroad surface textures and the original surface, considering the ground truth of the railroad defects. The generated images of the railroad surface were used as training data in defect detection network [2], which is based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) [3]. To validate its performance, we clustered and divided the railroad data into three subsets, one subset as original railroad texture images and the remaining two subsets as another railroad surface texture images. In the first experiment, we used only original texture images for training sets in the defect detection model. And in the second experiment, we trained the generated images that were generated by combining the original images with a few railroad textures of the other images. Each defect detection model was evaluated in terms of 'intersection of union(IoU)' and F1-score measures with ground truths. As a result, the scores increased by about 10~15% when the generated images were used, compared to the case that only the original images were used. This proves that it is possible to detect defects by using the existing data and a few different texture images, even for the railroad surface images in which dedicated training database is not constructed."

In this study, we proposed a multi-task learning (MTL) based deep learning model for real-time TC intensity estimation and forecasting with the lead time of 6-12 hours following the event, based on the fusion of geostationary satellite images and numerical forecast model output. A total of 142 TCs which developed in the Northwest Pacific from 2011 to 2016 were used in this study. The Communications system, the Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) data were used to extract the images of typhoons, and the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) provided by the National Center of Environmental Prediction (NCEP) was employed to extract air and ocean forecasting data. This study suggested two schemes with different input variables to the MTL models. Scheme 1 used only satellite-based input data while scheme 2 used both satellite images and numerical forecast modeling. As a result of real-time TC intensity estimation, Both schemes exhibited similar performance. For TC intensity forecasting with the lead time of 6 and 12 hours, scheme 2 improved the performance by 13% and 16%, respectively, in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE) when compared to scheme 1. Relative root mean squared errors (rRMSE) for most intensity levels were less than 30%. The lower mean absolute error (MAE) and RMSE were found for the lower intensity levels of TCs. In the test results of the typhoon HALONG in 2014, scheme 1 tended to overestimate the intensity by about 20 kts at the early development stage. Scheme 2 slightly reduced the error, resulting in an overestimation by about 5 kts. The MTL models reduced the computational cost about 300% when compared to the single-tasking model, which suggested the feasibility of the rapid production of TC intensity forecasts."

Complimentary abilities of both networks provide better overall accuracy than single conventional CNNs in the dataset. Moreover, instead of performing binary classification, the proposed model performs three-class classification being Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal control.

For example, users can utilize dance-tutorial systems to learn how to dance by watching andimitating a virtual instructor. The instructor can perform the optimal dance to the music, to which reinforcementlearning is applied. In this study, we propose a method of reinforcement learning in which the action space isdynamically adjusted. Because actions that are not performed or are unlikely to be optimal are not learned, andthe state space is not allocated, the learning time can be shortened, and the state space can be reduced. In anexperiment, the proposed method shows results similar to those of traditional Q-learning even when the statespace of the proposed method is reduced to approximately 0.33% of that of Q-learning. Consequently, theproposed method reduces the cost and time required for learning. Traditional Q-learning requires 6 million statespaces for learning 100,000 times. In contrast, the proposed method requires only 20,000 state spaces. A higherwinning rate can be achieved in a shorter period of time by retrieving 20,000 state spaces instead of 6 million."

Joint Torque Estimation Using sEMG and Deep Neural Network,2020,['Electromyogram · Multi channels surface-Electromyography (sEMG) · Upper limb · Joint torque estimation · Deep neural network · Regression · PRTE system'],,"With the aid of various physical and biological sensors, research is actively being conducted to understand the intention of wearer’s motions through parameters such as joint torque. sEMG signals can be measured faster than physical sensors, which are often used in the fi eld of behavioral intent identifi cation studies. However, electrodes must be placed in the correct positions, and due to the high volume of noise, professional knowledge and accurate hardware design are required. In this paper, a system is constructed to improve the sEMG signal measurement environment by producing small multichannel sEMG modules. In addition, deep neural network supervised learning algorithms are implemented to estimate the torque using only the sEMG signal. Based on this, we analyze the organization of algorithms, the processing of the sEMG data, and how the number of channels aff ects learning. The optimal deep natural network model selected by the analysis is implanted to embedded after learning. The implanted model performs a portable real-time torque optimization (PRTE) according to the sEMG signal entered. In this paper, we study the deep natural network algorithm for estimating sEMG hardware and torque, and how it is implanted into a portable embedded system for use in estimating real-time motion intent. The proposed deep natural network algorithm and the usefulness of the PRTE system are verifi ed through experiments."
Image Preprocessing-based Generalization and Transfer of Learning for Grasping in Cluttered Environments,2020,"['AI-based application', 'grasping', 'reinforcement learning', 'sim-to-real transfer.']",,"In a cluttered environment in which objects are lying very closely to each other, the arranging motion is required before the robot attempts to grasp the target object. Thus, a robot must determine which motion to perform based on a given situation. This study presents an approach to learning a decision-making ability for the robot to grasp the target object after rearranging the surrounding objects obstructing the target object. The learning is performed in the virtual environment, and the image, which is an input of the deep Q-network, is preprocessed todirectly apply the results of the learning to the real environment. That is, the difference between the two environments is minimized by making the states obtained from the virtual and real environments similar to each other. In addition, image preprocessing can be used to generalize the results of learning so that the robot can determine the appropriate actions to take when objects that were not used for learning are given. A hierarchical structure, which consists of high-level and low-level motion selectors, is used for the learning: the former determines the grasping or pushing actions while the latter determines how to perform such selected actions. The results of various experiments show that the proposed scheme is effective in grasping the target object in a cluttered environment without the need for any additional learning in the real world."

Analysis of Adverse Drug Reactions Identified in Nursing Notes Using Reinforcement Learning,2020,"['Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Nursing Records']",,"Objectives: Electronic Health Records (EHRs)-based surveillance systems are being actively developed for detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs), but this is being hindered by the difficulty of extracting data from unstructured records. This study performed the analysis of ADRs from nursing notes for drug safety surveillance using the temporal difference method in reinforcement learning (TD learning). Methods: Nursing notes of 8,316 patients (4,158 ADR and 4,158 non-ADR cases) admitted to Ajou University Hospital were used for the ADR classification task. A TD(λ) model was used to estimate state values for indicating the ADR risk. For the TD learning, each nursing phrase was encoded into one of seven states, and the state values estimated during training were employed for the subsequent testing phase. We applied logistic regression to the state values from the TD(λ) model for the classification task. Results: The overall accuracy of TD-based logistic regression of 0.63 was comparable to that of two machine-learning methods (0.64 for a naïve Bayes classifier and 0.63 for a support vector machine), while it outperformed two deep learning-based methods (0.58 for a text convolutional neural network and 0.61 for a long short-term memory neural network). Most importantly, it was found that the TD-based method can estimate state values according to the context of nursing phrases. Conclusions: TD learning is a promising approach because it can exploit contextual, time-dependent aspects of the available data and provide an analysis of the severity of ADRs in a fully incremental manner."
A Study on the Development of a Program to Body Circulation  Measurement Using the Machine Learning and Depth Camera,2020,"['Machine Learning', 'Depth Camera', 'Post Estimation', 'Realsense', 'Body Shape']",,"The circumference of the body is not only an indicator in order to buy clothes in our life but an important factor which can increase the effectiveness healing properly after figuring out the shape of body in a hospital.

Class-Labeling Method for Designing a Deep Neural Network of Capsule Endoscopic Images Using a Lesion-Focused Knowledge Model,2020,"['Capsule Endoscopy', 'Class-labeling Method', 'Deep Learning', 'Knowledge Base (KB)', 'Ontology']",,"Capsule endoscopy is one of the increasingly demanded diagnostic methods among patients in recent yearsbecause of its ability to observe small intestine difficulties. It is often conducted for 12 to 14 hours, butsignificant frames constitute only 10% of whole frames. Thus, it has been designed to automatically acquiresignificant frames through deep learning. For example, studies to track the position of the capsule (stomach,small intestine, etc.) or to extract lesion-related information (polyps, etc.) have been conducted. However,although grouping or labeling the training images according to similar features can improve the performanceof a learning model, various attributes (such as degree of wrinkles, presence of valves, etc.) are not consideredin conventional approaches. Therefore, we propose a class-labeling method that can be used to design a learningmodel by constructing a knowledge model focused on main lesions defined in standard terminologies forcapsule endoscopy (minimal standard terminology, capsule endoscopy structured terminology). This methodenables the designing of a systematic learning model by labeling detailed classes through differentiation ofsimilar characteristics."

A study on defect detection in X-ray image castings based on unsupervised learning,2020,"['Defect detection', 'X-ray image', 'Castings', 'Unsupervised', 'Deep learning']",,"In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based defect detection system for the non-destructive quality inspection of castings based on X-ray images. Our system comprises a defect classification network and a defect search network and achieves high classifi-cation performance with limited data by minimizing the overfitting for one type of object. The proposed defect classification network determines whether the acquired X-ray image is Defect by using a convolution neural network and outputs the defect probability through softmax. Compared to binarized defect classification or defect location tracking, this method of outputting the defect proba-bility does not require a separate reworking of the training dataset, because the data labeling is the same as the existing quality evalu-ation task. In addition, to detect the location of the defect causing the defect classification, our proposed defect search network estimates the region where the defect is likely to exist through a Grad-CAM based on the feature map of the classification network. The proposed network then determines the ROI around each peak of the estimated regions and detects the exact shape and location of the defect through boundary detection. It is, therefore, possible to minimize quality control costs through a precise quality analysis of each casting product by simultaneously detecting small defects that are easy to ignore because large defects are found in the image. To verify the validity of this study, an experiment was conducted by constructing a dataset of actual cast products, and the proposed detection model achieved an accuracy of 90%. In addition, by comparing the fully connected network and the SVM-based model, the model improved by about 20%, demonstrating that it is possible to detect defects without labeling defect locations."

Experiment and Implementation of a Machine-Learning Based k-Value Prediction Scheme in a k-Anonymity Algorithm,2020,"['Artificial Neural Networks', 'k-Anonymity', 'k Value Prediction', 'TensorFlow', '인공 신경망', 'k-익명화', 'k값 예측', '텐서플로우']",,"The k-anonymity scheme has been widely used to protect private information when Big Data are distributed to a third party for research purposes. When the scheme is applied, an optimal k value determination is one of difficult problems to be resolved because many factors should be considered. Currently, the determination has been done almost manually by human experts with their intuition. This leads to degrade performance of the anonymization, and it takes much time and cost for them to do a task. To overcome this problem, a simple idea has been proposed that is based on machine learning. This paper describes implementations and experiments to realize the proposed idea. In thi work, a deep neural network (DNN) is implemented using tensorflow libraries, and it is trained and tested using input dataset. The experiment results show that a trend of training errors follows a typical pattern in DNN, but for validation errors, our model represents a different pattern from one shown in typical training process. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it can reduce time and cost for experts to determine k value because it can be done semi-automatically."

A novel, transfer-learned AlexNet-based residual learning for Gaussian noise reduction is presented in this paper. The method can remove any level of Gaussian noise without having information about the noise variance in both gray scale and color images. Therefore, our technique is blind Gaussian image denoising that learns a residual image by eradicating the clean image from the transfer-learned AlexNet, and removes noise by identifying the difference from the input image. Experimental results with the proposed scheme are compared against a Gaussian denoiser for image denoising in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and visual perception. The results have revealed that our residual learning using transfer-learned AlexNet attains promising denoising results."

Development and Optimization of Deep Belief Networks Applied for Academic Performance Prediction with Larger Datasets,2020,"['Student performance', 'Deep learning', 'Restricted Boltzmann machine', 'Deep belief network', 'Feature selection', 'Hyperparameters', 'Regularization']",,"Deep learning has recently attracted increasing interest for several applications, and great progress has been made. This paper introduces a novel application of a deep learning framework called deep belief networks (DBNs) that can be used to predict the predicting academic performance of larger datasets. First, unsupervised training is considered a so-called pre-training section. The stacked restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was trained to obtain the trained weights instead of random initial weights. Subsequently, supervised learning was adopted using backpropagation in the fine-tuning section to classify the student performance levels. An optimization approach for improving the classification performance of the proposed DBN was proposed. The optimization approach consisted of using a feature selection method to obtain the optimal feature subset, optimizing the DBN model with the optimal values of the hyperparameters, and applying the L2-regularization method for weight decay. The experiment was carried out with two phases. Phase1 was implemented with an actual dataset. Phase 2 was then implemented with four artificial datasets of increasing sizes. Many experiments were performed independently on each dataset. With a larger dataset, the improved DBN generated the highest accuracy and lowest root mean square error with more accuracy and effectiveness than the other proposed algorithms."

Model-free Adaptive Optimal Control of Episodic Fixed-horizon Manufacturing Processes Using Reinforcement Learning,2020,"['Adaptive optimal control', 'manufacturing process optimization', 'model-free optimal control', 'reinforcement learning.']",,"A self-learning optimal control algorithm for episodic fixed-horizon manufacturing processes with timediscrete control actions is proposed and evaluated on a simulated deep drawing process. The control model is built during consecutive process executions under optimal control via reinforcement learning, using the measured product quality as a reward after each process execution. Prior model formulation, which is required by algorithms from model predictive control and approximate dynamic programming, is therefore obsolete. This avoids several difficulties namely in system identification, accurate modeling, and runtime complexity, that arise when dealing with processes subject to nonlinear dynamics and stochastic influences. Instead of using the pre-created process and observation models, value-function-based reinforcement learning algorithms build functions of expected future reward, which are used to derive optimal process control decisions. The expectation functions are learned online, by interacting with the process. The proposed algorithm takes stochastic variations of the process conditions into account and is able to cope with partial observability. A Q-learning-based method for adaptive optimal control of partially observable episodic fixed-horizon manufacturing processes is developed and studied. The resulting algorithm is instantiated and evaluated by applying it to a simulated stochastic optimal control problem in metal sheet deep drawing."
Semi-Supervised Learning Based Anomaly Detection for License Plate OCR in Real Time Video,2020,"['Anomaly Detection', 'Deep Learning', 'License Plate Recognition', 'Semi-Supervised  Learning', 'Optical Character Recognition (OCR)']",,"Recently, the license plate OCR system has been commercialized in a variety of fields and preferred utilizing low-cost embedded systems using only cameras. This system has a high recognition rate of about 98% or more for the environments such as parking lots where non-vehicle is restricted; however, the environments where non-vehicle objects are not restricted, the recognition rate is about 50% to 70%. This low performance is due to the changes in the environment by non-vehicle objects in real-time situations that occur anomaly data which is similar to the license plates. In this paper, we implement the appropriate anomaly detection based on semisupervised learning for the license plate OCR system in the real-time environment where the appearance of non-vehicle objects is not restricted. In the experiment, we compare systems which anomaly detection is not implemented in the preceding research with the proposed system in this paper. As a result, the systems which anomaly detection is not implemented had a recognition rate of 77%; however, the systems with the semisupervised learning based on anomaly detection had 88% of recognition rate. Using the techniques of anomaly detection based on the semi-supervised learning was effective in detecting anomaly data and it was helpful to improve the recognition rate of real-time situations."

In this study, we performed deep neural network modeling of the reflectance spectrum data of two pairs of oxide/nitride films on a silicon substrate. We designed a deep neural network model to estimate the thickness of four stacked thin-film layers and the MOLD film. Principle component analysis of this model was performed to develop another model with 27 features. Finally, a combined model was designed by fine tuning both the models and applying an ensemble algorithm to both.

Deep Neural Network-Based Concentration Model for Oak Pollen Allergy Warning in South Korea,2020,"['Pollen', 'pollen grains', 'deep learning', 'quercus', 'seasons', 'allergic rhinitis']",,"Purpose: Oak is the dominant tree species in Korea. Oak pollen has the highest sensitivity rate among all allergenic tree species in Korea. A deep neural network (DNN)-based estimation model was developed to determine the concentration of oak pollen and overcome the shortcomings of conventional regression models.Methods: The DNN model proposed in this study utilized weather factors as the input and provided pollen concentrations as the output. Weather and pollen concentration data were used from 2007 to 2016 obtained from the Korea Meteorological Administration pollen observation network. Because it is difficult to prevent over-fitting and underestimation by using a DNN model alone, we developed a bootstrap aggregating-type ensemble model. Each of the 30 ensemble members was trained with random sampling at a fixed rate according to the pollen risk grade. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compared its performance with those of models of regression and support vector regression (SVR) under the same conditions, with respect to the prediction of pollen concentrations, risk levels, and season length.Results: The mean absolute percentage error in the estimated pollen concentrations was 11.18%, 10.37%, and 5.04% for the regression, SVR and DNN models, respectively. The start of the pollen season was estimated to be 20, 22, and 6 days earlier than that predicted by the regression, SVR and DNN models, respectively. Similarly, the end of the pollen season was estimated to be 33, 20, and 9 days later that predicted by the regression, SVR and DNN models, respectively.Conclusions: Overall, the DNN model performed better than the other models. However, the prediction of peak pollen concentrations needs improvement. Improved observation quality with optimization of the DNN model will resolve this issue."
Deep RL Based Notch Filter Design Method for Complex Industrial Servo Systems,2020,"['Deep reinforcement learning', 'highly complex servo system', 'multiple notch filters', 'resonance suppression.']",,"This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) method for simultaneously designing several notch filters in complex industrial servo systems. Notch filters are highly effective for suppressing resonances in motion control systems and are widely utilized in industry. However, severe limitations exist in complex servo systems because there are many vibration modes that are difficult to identify. In such cases, several notch filters must be used, but the task of tuning these filters involves lengthy empirical procedures by well-experienced engineers. To automate this tuning process, this paper proposes a novel design method that can design several notch filters simultaneously for the first time. In this method, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with a vector stability margin as the reward function is utilized to find filter parameters in the frequency domain. The proposed method simultaneously finds a set of many parameters for several notch filters that are optimal with respect to stability. Using a real industrial servo system that has multiple resonances, it is demonstrated that the proposed method effectively finds the optimal parameters for several notch filters and successfully suppresses multiple resonances to provide desired performances."

Scheme of a Classic Control-Based Program Model with Non-Symmetric Deep Auto-Encoder of Actor-Critic,2020,"['actor-critic', 'program model', 'OpenAI gym', 'non-symmetric deep auto-encoder', 'reinforcement learning']",,"Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Actor-Critic (A2C), one of policy gradient (PG) algorithms becomes a mainstream. A design of a classic control-based program model requires domain-indicated experience knowledge based on a neural network for incorporating into the model strategy, which becomes A2C-powered. There are some research studies on the program model using general Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, in other words, A2C and neural networks. The previous well-known algorithms can proceed from a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to attempting an experiment with more complicated additions, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory models). However, there are concerns about the requirements of the current experimental environment when faced with the demands of significant computational powers. Therefore, we employ a definition of Actor-Critic with non-symmetric deep auto-encoder to find an optimal behavior strategy for the agent to obtain optimal rewards with the bottommost environmental resources. Algorithm comparisons show that our proposed model demonstrates improvements of optimal rewards with the minimum limit over the developed deep neural network combined Actor-Critic."

For example, typical scenarios for AI include production management, analyses of ships on a voyage, and motion prediction. Therefore, this study was conducted to predict a response amplitude operator (RAO) through AI technology. It used a neural network based on one of the types of AI methods. The data used in the neural network consisted of the properties of the vessel and RAO values, based on simulating the in-house code. The learning model consisted of an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The input layer comprised eight neurons, the hidden layer comprised the variables, and the output layer comprised 20 neurons.

Therefore, if 3D data can be stored at a clinically acceptable compression rate, the burden in terms of storage space and cost can be reduced and data can be managed more efficiently. In this study, a deep learning network for super-resolution was tested to restore compressed virtual CBCT images. Materials and Methods: Virtual CBCT image data were created with a publicly available online dataset (CQ500) of multidetector computed tomography images using CBCT reconstruction software (TIGRE).

This system has a high recognition rate of about 98% or more for the environments such as parking lots where non-vehicle is restricted; however, the environments where non-vehicle objects are not restricted, the recognition rate is about 50% to 70%. This low performance is due to the changes in the environment by non-vehicle objects in real-time situations that occur anomaly data which is similar to the license plates. In this paper, we implement the appropriate anomaly detection based on semi-supervised learning for the license plate OCR system in the real-time environment where the appearance of non-vehicle objects is not restricted. In the experiment, we compare systems which anomaly detection is not implemented in the preceding research with the proposed system in this paper. As a result, the systems which anomaly detection is not implemented had a recognition rate of 77%; however, the systems with the semi-supervised learning based on anomaly detection had 88% of recognition rate. Using the techniques of anomaly detection based on the semi-supervised learning was effective in detecting anomaly data and it was helpful to improve the recognition rate of real-time situations."

DeepCleanNet: Training Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Extremely Noisy Labels,2020,"['Image Classification', 'Noisy Labels', 'Corrupted Labels', 'CNN.']",,"In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully implemented in different tasks of computer vision. Since CNN models are the representatives of supervised learning algorithms, they demand large amount of data in order to train the classifiers. Thus, obtaining data with correct labels is imperative to attain the state-of-the-art performance of the CNN models. However, labelling datasets is quite tedious and expensive process, therefore real-life datasets often exhibit incorrect labels. Although the issue of poorly labelled datasets has been studied before, we have noticed that the methods are very complex and hard to reproduce. Therefore, in this research work, we propose Deep CleanNet - a considerably simple system that achieves competitive results when compared to the existing methods. We use K-means clustering algorithm for selecting data with correct labels and train the new dataset using a deep CNN model. The technique achieves competitive results in both training and validation stages.

In this study, we have attempted to learn the embeddings of this important biomarker. As conventional metric learning methods for feature embedding is known to lacking in capturing semantic similarity among the data under study, we have trained deep Siamese convolutional neural network for learning metric of the hippocampus.

Face Anti-spoofing Using Deep Dual Network,2020,"['Face anti-spoofing', 'Stereo facial images', 'Deep neural network', 'Latent space']",,"Face recognition has been adopted widely for real-world applications because of its convenience and contactless nature. On the other hand, forged faces for spoofing attacks can be fabricated easily using a variety of materials, such as pictures, high-resolution videos, and printed masks, etc., which pose a great threat to face-based recognition systems. Therefore, face antispoofing has become an essential technique to achieve high-level security. Although many studies have explored effective features to discriminate live faces from fake ones, even with deep neural networks, they still struggle to grasp meaningful differences from a single image because of the sophisticated spoofing attacks with various media. This paper proposes a novel method for face anti-spoofing based on stereo facial images. Because the three-dimensional structure of a live face clearly yields a structural difference in the image pair taken by a stereo camera, whereas significant differences do not occur in fake faces of two-dimensional planes, this paper proposes to learn the differences of left-right image pairs in the latent space of a deep neural network. One important advantage of the proposed method is that the structural difference is encoded implicitly in a nonlinear manner through the deep architecture without explicitly computing the disparity. The experimental results on a constructed dataset revealed the proposed method to be effective for diverse spoofing attacks."
A fault diagnosis method using Interval coded deep belief network,2020,['· Rolling bearing · Interval coded deep belief network · Fault diagnosis · Rotating machinery'],,"The rolling bearing, though a widely used component in rotating machinery, is also failure-prone. There are some difficulties in extracting valuable fault features from the vibration signal generated by the rolling bearing operation. Based on the interval coded deep belief network, an improved method for fault diagnosis is introduced to deal with the existing problems. Interval code is an encoding method to characterize fault features by using bearing vibration amplitude distribution. This method can also reduce the complexity of the original data and integrate input dimension. The deep belief network can remove the dependence from manual feature extraction and quickly extract the fault features from coding results. This proposed method is employed in the fault diagnosis experiments of rolling bearing to evaluate the performance. From the obtained experiment results, it can be concluded that the interval coded deep belief network boosts performance, which can eliminate the limitation of the input data dimension in the traditional deep learning model."

Therefore, pre-service science teachers need to have a precise and deep understanding of life science concepts related to disease before they can be put into the school. The purpose of this study is to identify the types of life science concepts status related to the diseases of pre-service science teachers. The study was conducted through an open survey divided into three areas: antibiotics, immunity and cancer. As a result, pre-service science teachers have often confused antibiotics with immune responses in the definition of antibiotics. In addition, when defining antibiotics, there was no precise classification of antibiotic targets such as microorganisms, bacteria, and viruses. In defining immunity, most of the explanation was based on acquired immunity, which excludes innate immunity. The most unscientific concept was the type of adaptation in the individual. In the definition of cancer, the explanation of the specificity of cancer cells, which pre-service teachers distinguish between malignant and benign tumors, was somewhat insufficient. This study is expected to be used for data on the current state of teacher education as well as the types of concepts related to the diseases of pre-service science teachers."

The clinical efficacy was evaluated by comparing the bone ages that were determined using the system with those from the reference standard produced by 2 oral and maxillofacial radiologists. Comparisons were conducted using the paired t-test and simple regression analysis.Results: The bone ages estimated with this bone age assessment system were not significantly different from those obtained with the reference standard (P>0.05) and satisfied the equivalence criterion of 0.6 years within the 95% confidence interval (- 0.07 to 0.22), demonstrating excellent performance of the system. Similarly, in the comparisons of gender subgroups, no significant difference in bone age between the values produced by the system and the reference standard was observed (P>0.05 for both boys and girls). The determination coefficients obtained via regression analysis were 0.962, 0.945, and 0.952 for boys, girls, and overall, respectively (P=0.000); hence, the radiologist-determined bone ages and the system-determined bone ages were strongly correlated.Conclusion: This TW3-based system can be effectively used for bone age assessment based on hand-wrist radiographs of Korean children and adolescents."

One driving point in the security field is the ability to detect the source of the danger and take action against it as quickly as possible. Via the usage of a fully convolutional network, it is possible to create the label map of an input image, indicating what object is occupying the specific area of the image. This research employs the usage of U-net, which was constructed in biomedical field segmentation to segment cells, instead of the original FCN.

Testing the network after training resulted in some images where the network pronounces even better detail than the expected label map. With better detailed label map, the network might be able to produce better segmentation is something to be studied in further research."

Depending on the type of attenuated noise, these studies are grouped into denoising applications of coherent noise, random noise, and the combination of these two types of noise. Then, we investigate the deep-learning techniques used to remove the corresponding noise. Unlike conventional methods used to attenuate seismic noise, deep neural networks, a typical deep-learning technique, learn the characteristics of the noise independently and then automatically optimize the parameters. Therefore, such methods are less sensitive to generalized problems than conventional methods and can reduce labor costs.

Total factor productivity, financial leverage, and R&D expenditure were used as input variables and export participation was used as an output variable for time series classification with deep learning. We have trained and compared the three deep learning models for time series classification: multi layer perceptron, fully convolutional network, and residual network.

In particular, image detection algorithms are broadly used in forestry and remote sensing areas to identify forest types and tree species. However, in South Korea, machine learning has rarely, if ever, been applied in forestry image detection, especially to classify tree species. This study integrates the application of machine learning and forest image detection; specifically, we compared the ability of two machine learning data collection methods, namely image data captured by forest experts (D1) and web-crawling (D2), to automate the classification of five trees species. In addition, two methods of characterization to train/test the system were investigated. The results indicated a significant difference in classification accuracy between D1 and D2: the classification accuracy of D1 was higher than that of D2. In order to increase the classification accuracy of D2, additional data filtering techniques were required to reduce the noise of uncensored image data."

Therefore, the Supervision is until now thearea where a lot of money, time and manpower are needed. This might give a room for superficial, formal and documentary supervision thatcould lead to faulty construction. This study suggests a way of Building Supervision which is more automatic and effective so that it canlead to save the time, effort and money. And the way is to detect the hoop-bars of a column and count the number of it automatically.

In the IEEE 802.11ac standard, the information of the modulation scheme is indicated by the modulation coding scheme (MCS) included in the VHT-SIG-A of the preamble field. Transmitting end determines the MCS index suitable for the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) situation and transmits the data accordingly. Since data field decoding can take place only when the receiving end acquires the MCS index information of the frame. Therefore, accurate MCS detection must be guaranteed before data field decoding. However, since the MCS index information is the information obtained through preamble field decoding, the detection rate can be affected significantly in a low SNR situation. In this paper, we propose a relatively robust modulation classification method based on deep learning to solve the low detection rate problem with a conventional method caused by a low SNR."

First of all, this study verified the significant effects of each air pollutant with a time lag on the outbreak of asthma through the time-lag Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Second, train data built on the basis of verification results are utilized in Deep Learning algorithms, and models optimized for predicting the asthmatic occurrence are designed. The average error rate of the model was about 11.86%, indicating superior performance compared to other machine learning-based algorithms. The proposed model can be used for efficiency in the national insurance system and health budget management, and can also provide efficiency in the deployment and supply of medical personnel in hospitals. And it can also contribute to the promotion of national health through early warning of the risk of outbreak by atmospheric environment for chronic asthma patients."

There are two major aspects of location-related information contained in Wi-Fi signals. One is channel state information (CSI), and one is received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Compared to the RSSI, the CSI has been widely utilized because it is able to reveal fine-grained information related to locations. However, the conventional IPS that employs a single access point (AP) does not exhibit decent performance especially in the environment of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situations due to the reliability degeneration of signals caused by multipath fading effect. In order to address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes multiple APs instead of a single AP to enhance the robustness of the IPS. In our proposed method, a hybrid neural network is applied to the CSIs collected from multiple APs. By relying more on the fingerprint constructed by the CSI collected from an AP that is less affected by the NLOS, we find that the performance of the IPS is significantly improved."

In this study, the authors propose a methodology for predicting the net construction duration for each activity by applying a deep learning algorithm that discovers patterns in large amounts of construction history already executed, self-learns, and provides comprehensive judgment and prediction for the calculation of net construction duration. For this, a deep learning application model that can be used for construction duration estimation was developed, and practical applicability was analyzed by comparing predicted and actual duration. Through this, it is considered possible to derive an objective construction duration more accurately than possible using existing estimation methods, and it is thought that utilization of deep learning in the construction management process will also increase."

Unlike conventional machine learning methods that use the hand-crafted features, we adopt the denoising autoencoder in order to generate a precise and accurate representation of the pixels. We first construct a hybrid vector that combines original image, difference of Gaussians and image gradients. The created hybrid features are then given to a deep autoencoder that learns the pixels’ internal dependencies and the cells’ shape and boundary information. The latent representations learned by the autoencoder are used as the inputs of a softmax classification layer and the direct outputs from the classifier represent the coarse segmentation mask.Finally, the classifier’s outputs are used as prior information for a graph partitioning based fine segmentation. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid vector representation manages to preserve the global shape and boundary information of the cells, allowing to retrieve the majority of the cellular patterns without the need of any post-processing."

It detects automatically floating debris, which has a clash risk with objects in the surrounding water and used to be checked by a captain with a naked eye, at a similar level of accuracy to the human check method. It is used to detect objects around a ship. In the past, they were detected with information gathered from radars or sonar devices. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, intelligent CCTV installed in a ship are used to detect various types of floating debris on the course of sailing. If the speed of processing video data slows down due to the various requirements and complexity of MASS, however, there is no guarantee for safety as well as smooth service support. Trying to solve this issue, this study conducted research on the minimization of computation volumes for video data and the increased speed of data processing to detect maritime objects. Unlike previous studies that used the Hough transform algorithm to find the horizon and secure the areas of interest for the concerned objects, the present study proposed a new method of optimizing a binarization algorithm and finding areas whose locations were similar to actual objects in order to improve the speed. A maritime object detection system was materialized based on deep learning CNN to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method and assess the performance of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm performed at a speed that was 4 times faster than the old method while keeping the detection accuracy of the old method."

Traditional methods require exterior orientation parameters of aerial images and precise 3D object modeling data and DTM (Digital Terrain Model) to detect and recover occlusion areas. Furthermore, it is challenging task to automate the complicated process. In this paper, we proposed a new concept of true orthoimage generation using DL (Deep Learning). DL is rapidly used in wide range of fields. In particular, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) is one of the DL models for various tasks in imaging processing and computer vision. The generator tries to produce results similar to the real images, while discriminator judges fake and real images until the results are satisfied. Such mutually adversarial mechanism improves quality of the results. Experiments were performed using GAN-based Pix2Pix model by utilizing IR (Infrared) orthoimages, intensity from LiDAR data provided by the German Society for Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Geoinformation (DGPF) through the ISPRS (International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing). Two approaches were implemented: (1) One-step training with intensity data and high resolution orthoimages, (2) Recursive training with intensity data and color-coded low resolution intensity images for progressive enhancement of the results. Two methods provided similar quality based on FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) measures. However, if quality of the input data is close to the target image, better results could be obtained by increasing epoch. This paper is an early experimental study for feasibility of DL-based true orthoimage generation and further improvement would be necessary."

The purpose of this study is to apply a method that combines deep learning, a non-spatial technique, and geographic variables that can take into account the spatial autocorrelation of soil properties in order to understand the spatial distribution of soil properties in an agricultural landscape. As a result, first, there were variable combinations that showed better assessment results than when using all variables in all soil properties. Second, for all soil properties, geographic variable-based models did not always show better the assessment results than environmental variablebased models, but it was confirmed that geographic variables can be actively used in soil prediction. Finally, the method of combining environmental and geographic variables did not always yield better results. When examining the spatial distribution of soil properties, the region with the lowest organic matter content and soil pH was the region located in the center of Jindo, close to Seokgyo river. In the case of available phosphorus, the content was high mainly in the fields located on the pediment with relatively high altitude among agricultural land.

Using skills and focusing on the reading tasks, the present study aims to reveal the distributional properties of disfluencies. Methods: The current work segmented the reading data of 110 adolescents and adults who stutter, transformed the data into a vector space, and then conducted the embedding calculation. Utilizing Word2Vec, the cosine similarity was measured so as to look at how the types of disfluencies were co-related to each other. Results: The eight ND (Normal disfluencies) and AD (Abnormal disfluencies) types, excluding the R2 (Repetition 2) and DP (Disrhythmic Phonation) types, were close to each other with respect to the cosine similarity (>.9). In particular, the AD types such as Ha (Abnormal hesitation), Ia (Abnormal interjection), URa (Abnormal unfinished/revision word), and R1a (Abnormal Repetition1) largely overlapped with each other. R2 and DP showed different distributional properties from other types of disfluencies. The results also indicated that each ND and AD pair seldom differed in their distributional properties. Finally, this study it found that several consonants tended to appear more often when the speakers produced disfluencies.

In this paper, we propose a method to find an image similar to the input image, extract the label attached to the image, find the posts on instagram, where the label exists as a tag, and recommend other tags in the post. In the proposed method, the label is extracted from the image through the model of the convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning technique, and the instagram is crawled with the extracted label to sort and recommended tags other than the label. We can see that it is easy to post an image using the recommended tag, increase the exposure of the search, and derive high accuracy due to fewer search errors."

The machines for these automation processes are controlled based on the data collected from the sensors attached to them, and further, the processes are managed.Conventionally, the abnormalities of sensors are periodically checked and managed. However, due to various environmental factors and situations in the industrial field, there are cases where the inspection due to the failure is not missed or failures are not detected to prevent damage due to sensor failure.In addition, even if a failure occurs, it is not immediately detected, which worsens the process loss.Therefore, in order to prevent damage caused by such a sudden sensor failure, it is necessary to identify the failure of the sensor in an embedded system in real-time and to diagnose the failure and determine the type for a quick response. In this paper, a deep neural network-based fault diagnosis system is designed and implemented using Raspberry Pi to classify typical sensor fault types such as erratic fault, hard-over fault, spike fault, and stuck fault.

Gwangdeoksan radar data were collected from 2010 to 2016 and converted to a gray-scale image file in an HDF5 format with a 1km spatial resolution. The deep neural network model was trained to predict precipitation after 10 minutes by using the four consecutive radar image data, and the recursive method of repeating forecasts was applied to carry out lead time 60 minutes with the pretrained deep neural network model. To evaluate the performance of deep neural network prediction model, 24 rain cases in 2017 were forecast for rainfall up to 60 minutes in advance. As a result of evaluating the predicted performance by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) and critical success index (CSI) at the threshold of 0.1, 1, and 5 mm/hr, the deep neural network model showed better performance in the case of rainfall threshold of 0.1, 1 mm/hr in terms of MAE, and showed better performance than the translation model for lead time 50 minutes in terms of CSI. In particular, although the deep neural network prediction model performed generally better than the translation model for weak rainfall of 5 mm/hr or less, the deep neural network prediction model had limitations in predicting distinct precipitation characteristics of high intensity as a result of the evaluation of threshold of 5 mm/hr. The longer lead time, the spatial smoothness increase with lead time thereby reducing the accuracy of rainfall prediction The translation model turned out to be superior in predicting the exceedance of higher intensity thresholds (> 5 mm/hr) because it preserves distinct precipitation characteristics, but the rainfall position tends to shift incorrectly. This study are expected to be helpful for the improvement of radar rainfall prediction model using deep neural networks in the future. In addition, the massive weather radar data established in this study will be provided through open repositories for future use in subsequent studies."

We used Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets, which are frequently used to evaluate person re-identification experiments.Moreover, the vehicle re-identification experiment was evaluated by using VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets. Since the proposed method does not designed for a neural network specialized for a specific object, it can re-identify simultaneously both person and vehicle. To demonstrate this, an experiment was performed by using a person and vehicle re-identification dataset together"

The process of extracting feature information of an object grasp and estimating the joint angles of the robot are performed at one time from one deep neural network. There is a time-consuming and difficult pre-processing for deep learning in the robot grasping that sufficient data such as a high-quality three-dimensional object model composed of multi-modal sensor information must be secured. We use a relatively small amount of RGB images captured by the head camera and wrist camera to minimize the effort. We present a system that performs the entire grasping operation with two identical structures of deep neural networks, and generate an image focused on a target object using a semantic segmentation technique to maximize efficiency by using it as an input of the first deep neural network. We propose a method to solve various one-to-many matching situations that occur in robot grasping by modifying the Mixture Density Network(MDN) to output the amount of change from the current to the next joint angles. Each learning weight of joints is trained as a learning variable or random constants are given to the training weights of robot joints in the kernel function. Training systems show a high improvement of the success rate. In the experiment of grasping the new pose of the known objects used for learning, the grasping success rate was 81%, and 80% in the experiment of the alternative objects not used in learning."

Instead of accepting Plato’s theory of Reminiscence, both Augustine and Aquinas developed their own epistemological learning perspectives, that is to say, the theory of Divine Illumination and the theory of Abstraction, respectively. Both theories are based on will and intellect, but they differ according to whether the emphasis is put on will or intellect. To review the theories, it is important to acknowledge in both that will and intellect are the beginning points of learning and that they also have a connection with memory as a source of learning. Will, intellect and memory, thus, produce knowledge altogether in the process of learning. For Augustine, belief connected with will is the beginning point of acquiring knowledge. On the contrary, Aquinas thinks that learning stems from intellect in that the intellect presenting objects activates will. Memory, in terms of presenting materials for learning, is closely related to will and intellect. Will brings materials from memory so as to proceed to the Truth; intellect needs exercises to let people achieve a higher level of learning by strengthening memory. In particular, memory linked with virtues or the Good shows the direction to which people should turn. In this way, the theory of Divine Illumination and the theory of Abstraction differ in understanding how people produce knowledge by integrating will, intellect and memory. On the one hand, Augustine argues that divine illumination that assures the judgement of human mind is necessary for securing knowledge through learning. On the other hand, Aquinas says that God’s involvement is already retained in the active intellect of mind that conducts abstracting process for knowledge. Nonetheless, both learning perspectives are rooted in the deep understanding of imperfect humans. In that sense, both Augustine and Aquinas encourage everyone to proceed to the Truth or the Good while harmoniously integrating both the inner direction of will and the learning effort of intellect on the basis of the complementary relationship of will and intellect."

This study reviews the relationship between teaching and learning in Sishujizhu(四書集注), and specifically discusses how these aspects of the relationship develop.Above all, teaching, as the foundation and condition of learning, indicates teachers’ good examples and students’ sincere imitation. Second, teaching enables self-care to be developed into caring others through the spread of learning from personal dimension to social dimension. Finally, teaching and learning help us apprehend how teachers and students have deep conversations and discussions each other through their mutual growing relationship.

We developed a reading program using dramatization and included it in the J college program in the second semester of 2019. Then its learning effects were investigated and suggestions for future applications of the program were offered. A survey of the subjects revealed that the program enhanced learning. Based on that finding, we presented the following comments and suggestions:First, this program model was designed based on the class environment in J university, but it should be applied as a university masterpiece reading program, dramatizing novels in the classroom to enhance learning effects.Second, the subjects responded that writing book reviews is more helpful to understanding a masterpiece than is dramatization. However, the responses indicated that both activities had their own learning effects, as indicated by the subjects' responses that writing book reviews helped them understand texts comprehensively and that dramatizing novels helped them identify the deep meaning of texts. Therefore we suggest that a university masterpiece-reading program should be designed to include both writing book reviews and dramatization.Third, the subjects responded that the most difficult thing in the reading program was identifying themes in the texts they read. This finding was unfortunate, since the study included diverse learning methods to enhance the understanding of textual themes, although they apparently were not effective. When the ongoing program strategy is developed, the students' learning objectives and discussion subjects should be geared to the students' cognitive levels."

The smart factory's equipment works in a physical combination of numerous hardware, rather than a virtual character being driven by a single object, such as a game. In other words, for a specific common goal, multiple devices must perform individual actions simultaneously. By taking advantage of the smart factory, which can collect process data in real time, if reinforcement learning is used instead of general machine learning, behavior control can be performed without the required training data. However, in the real world, it is impossible to learn more than tens of millions of iterations due to physical wear and time. Thus, this paper uses simulators to develop grid sortation systems focusing on transport facilities, one of the complex environments in smart factory field, and design cooperative multi-agent-based reinforcement learning to demonstrate efficient behavior control."

With this prior, pseudo ground-truth is first generated to establish an unsupervised loss function. The proposed enhancement network is then trained using the proposed unsupervised loss function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that performs a low-light image enhancement through unsupervised learning.

The 1990s was the point when the theory of national literature and the theory of East Asia began to be newly combined, and the time when the criticism of the national state ideology of the study of Korean literature became visible/prepared. Cho Dongil’s work has a subtle tense relationship with the main themes and keywords of contemporary Korean literature research, but different content and methodology.The trilogy of <Re－considering of Medieval Literature>, which can be regarded as one of the achievements of Cho Dongil’s research in the 1990s, presents an ambitious planning intention to overcome the two axes of modernism and westernism. Recognition of the Middle Ages is required as an alternative to overcome the evils of modern－centrism. However, the modern criticism of Cho Dongil and the idealization of the Middle Ages remain in common sense in their concreteness and require attention. Criticism of the modern era is not based on the review of the internal elements that constitute the modern, but rather a criticism based on the necessary and customary criticism. see. The way of explaining medieval ‘excellence’ as a wealthy 0powerhouse resembles that of a single－line view of development. Furthermore, the episteme penetrating the interior of the work is the most “modern(scientific)”, and the modern－Western(scientific) thinking system remains strong despite the author’s intention.The criticism of modernity, which proceeded in the absence of a deep reflection on the modern era, fails to uptake capitalism and the world system attached to it. The lack of elements of economic history is drawn mainly in the Middle Ages centered on the upper class, where the understanding of political history is the name of the most textbooked dynasty. Despite observing the long－term history consistent with the ancient－medieval－modern period, as capitalism became naturalized and invisible, the Middle Ages became ‘competitive’ with modernity, in other words,‘modern candidates’ with different names. Will appear as. In addition to this, the author’s claim that it is a philosophy of history, the overcoming－becoming theroy(생극론), shows Korea’s ‘victory’ and its position as the center of the world in the infinite orbital circular structure of the dichotomy of advancement and backwardness, and victory and defeat.The result of the journey toward the Middle Ages in search of an alternative to the modern world has resulted in capitalism－Korea, which brings many concerns and not a few implications. This is because it is the result of a scholar’s nearly 50 years of academic struggle and a conclusion of the study of Korean literature and furthermore. It is difficult to say that declaring oneself as universal in order to compensate for the obsession or desire for the universal is the direction of our study in the future. The future direction of Korean studies research should go beyond boundaries and pay more attention to conversational work."

However, although the existing DNNs can not provide the explanations for their decisions, those trials have attempted to determine whether patients have certain diseases or not and those decisions could not be accepted because of the absence of relating theoretical basis. In addition, these DNNs required a lot of training data to obtain sufficient accuracy in spite of the difficulty in the acquisition of relating clinical data. In this study, a small-sized continuous data processing DNN (C-DNN) was suggested to determine the simple characteristics of ECG wave that were not required additional explanations about its decisions and the C-DNN can be easily trained with small training data. Although it can analyze small input data that was selected in narrow region on whole ECG, it can continuously scan all ECG data and find important points such as start and end points of P, QRS and T waves within a short time. The star and end points of ECG waves determined by the C-DNNs were compared with the results performed by human experts to estimate the accuracies of the C-DNNs. The C-DNN has 150 inputs, 51 outputs, two hidden layers and one output layer. To find the start and end points, two C-DNNs were trained through deep learning technology and applied to a parameter acquisition algorithms. 12 lead ECG data measured in four patients and obtained through PhysioNet was processed to make training data by human experts. The accuracy of the C-DNNs were evaluated with extra data that were not used at deep learning by comparing the results between C-DNNs and human experts. The averages of the time differences between the C-DNNs and experts were 0.1 msec and 13.5 msec respectively and those standard deviations were 17.6 msec and 15.7 msec. The final step combining the results of C-DNN through the waveforms of 12 leads was successfully determined all 33 waves without error that the time differences of human experts decision were over 20 msec. The reliable decision of the ECG wave's start and end points benefits the acquisition of accurate ECG parameters such as the wave lengths, amplitudes and intervals of P, QRS and T waves."

In this sense, this paper aims to examine 1) whether publicly available weather data generated in South Korea has sufficient quality to predict soil moisture, 2) which machine learning algorithm would perform best in the situation of South Korea, and 3) whether a single machine learning model could be generally applicable in various regions. We used various machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extremely Randomized Trees (ET), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Deep Feedforward Network (DFN) to predict future soil moisture in Andong, Boseong, Cheolwon, Suncheon region with open source weather data. As a result, GBM model showed the lowest prediction error in every data set we used (R squared: 0.96, RMSE: 1.8). Furthermore, GBM showed the lowest variance of prediction error between regions which indicates it has the highest generalizability."

In empirical benchmark works, time difference learning (TD) shows better results than Monte-Carlo learning (MC). However, among some previous works show that MC is better than TD when the reward is very rare or delayed. Also, another recent research shows when the information observed by the agent from the environment is partial on complex control works, it indicates that the MC prediction is superior to the TD-based methods. Most of these environments can be regarded as 5-step Q-learning or 20-step Q-learning, where the experiment continues without long roll-outs for alleviating reduce performance degradation. In other words, for networks with a noise, a representative network that is regardless of the controlled roll-outs, it is better to learn MC, which is robust to noisy rewards than TD, or almost identical to MC. These studies provide a break with that TD is better than MC. These recent research results show that the way combining MC and TD is better than the theoretical one. Therefore, in this study, based on the results shown in previous studies, we attempt to exploit a random balance with a mixture of TD and MC in RL without any complicated formulas by rewards used in those studies do. Compared to the DQN using the MC and TD random mixture and the well-known DQN using only the TD-based learning, we demonstrate that a well-performed TD learning are also granted special favor of the mixture of TD and MC through an experiments in OpenAI Gym."

In particular, the next-generation industries represented by artificial intelligence (AI) are presenting a future of unpredictable forms that have no historical origin.When countries are busy with social and institutional rearrangements for technological innovation in order to survive the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is necessary to discuss what problems the copyright sector has and how to solve it. It is emerging as a new creator in the realm of creation that only artificial human beings could do, and it is about a series of processes performed by artificial intelligence within the existing copyright law system, and the result produced by learning like human beings. I think it's because we need a philosophical, legal and economic analysis of how it is desirable to deal with it.This study examines how the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning, should be evaluated and regulated in relation to the use of copyrighted works in accordance with the purpose and intent of copyright law. The current discussion on artificial intelligence seems to focus on the discussion of whether AI can recognize this as a work for the output produced as a result of learning, and if so, who is the author.This study considered how artificial intelligence uses existing human-created works as a legal basis in the learning process such as machine learning, and whether copyright infringement can be indemnified for the purpose of industrial development. In particular, I would like to examine whether the study of highly intelligent AI can be permitted under the principle of fair use, which is a general provision of copyright restrictions.The fair use doctrine is to recognize the protection of 'expression of human creators' first and to use it as a tool to practice it, so that the alienation of human creators can be prevented by the development of technology. I think that continuous research should be done to balance between human creators and the technology industry to protect the purpose of copyright law."

However, DNNs are vulnerable to an adversarial example. An adversarial example is an attack sample that causes the neural network to recognize it incorrectly by adding minimal noise to the original sample. However, the disadvantage is that it takes a long time to generate such an adversarial example. Therefore, in some cases, an attack may be necessary that quickly causes the neural network to recognize it incorrectly. In this paper, we propose a fast misclassification sample that can rapidly attack neural networks. The proposed method does not consider the distortion of the original sample when adding noise. We used MNIST and CIFAR10 as experimental data and Tensorflow as a machine learning library. Experimental results show that the fast misclassification sample generated by the proposed method can be generated with 50% and 80% reduced number of iterations for MNIST and CIFAR10, respectively, compared to the conventional Carlini method, and has 100% attack rate."

In this paper, a method using an extended RetinaNet is proposed that automatically detects its component category and position for each component mounted on PCBs from a high-resolution color input image. We extended the basic RetinaNet feature pyramid network by adding a feature pyramid layer having higher spatial resolution to the basic feature pyramid. It was demonstrated by experiments that the extended RetinaNet can detect successfully very small components that could be missed by the basic RetinaNet.Using the proposed method could enable automatic generation of inspection areas, thus considerably reducing the setup time of PCB component inspection systems."

An abundance of data is trained on high-performance computers and a trained model is generated, and then the model is loaded in an inferencer.

To solve this problem, real-world objects are collected and they are trained periodically. However, not only is it difficult to immediately improve the recognition rate, but is not easy to learn an inferencer on embedded devices. We propose a real-time handwriting recognizer based on partial learning on embedded devices. The recognizer provides a training environment which partially learn on embedded devices at every user request, and its trained model is updated in real time. As this can improve intelligence of the recognizer automatically, recognition rate of unrecognized handwriting increases.

However, the process gives rise to a nonlinear temperature variation, which is difficult to predict using a traditional physics model. As an alternative, this study employed machine-learning technology to predict such temperature variation for the first time. Mg alloy was exposed to a single electropulse with a variety of pulse magnitudes and durations for this purpose. Nine machine-learning models were established from algorithms from artificial neural network (ANN), deep neural network (DNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The ANN models showed an insufficient predicting capability with respect to the region of peak temperature, where temperature varied most significantly. The DNN models were built by increasing model complexity, enhancing architectures, and tuning hyperparameters. They exhibited a remarkable improvement in predicting capability at the heating-cooling boundary as well as overall estimation. As a result, the DNN-2 model in this group showed the best prediction of nonlinear temperature variation among the machinelearning models built in this study. The XGBoost model exhibited poor predicting performance when default hyperparameters were applied. However, hyperparameter tuning of learning rates and maximum depths resulted in a decent predicting capability with this algorithm. Furthermore, XGBoost models exhibited an extreme reduction in learning time compared with the ANN and DNN models. This advantage is expected to be useful for predicting more complicated cases including various materials, multi-step electropulses, and electrically-assisted forming."

Urban inundation has become more dangerous to residents because of an increase in impermeable areas, uncertainties in urban sewage planning, and the accumulation of sedimentation in drainage pipes. As an urban watershed with a drainage system and an urbanized river is complicated, a specific time interval is required for the preparation and processing of urban runoff analysis. To allow for rapid simulations of urban runoff estimation during heavy rainfall, a deep neural network model that imitates the conditions of a 6-h duration rainfall was developed in this study. Ten different statistical aspects for each rainfall event were considered as input data, and the total accumulated overflow from a manhole was calculated at intervals of 10 min using storm water management model (SWMM). To verify the accuracy of the results from SWMM, the results obtained from a two-dimensional hydraulic model and an inundation trace map were compared. The computational times for the deep neural network and rainfall data-based models proposed in this study were estimated to be within 1 s, whereas the simulation using SWMM required 14 min.

GAN을 이용한 비지도학습 기반의 새로운 링크 예측 알고리즘,2020,"['Link Prediction', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Generative Adversarial Network']",,"A social network is typically represented as a graph (or network), where links on the graph represent relationships between nodes. The link prediction problem determines which links are likely to appear in the future graphs. We propose a novel link prediction algorithm based on unsupervised learning of the network using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). For recent years, the GAN has been very successful in image generation applications. This study is one of few attempts to utilize the GAN for non-image related applications. In our approach, the GAN is trained to learn the structural characteristics of a given network complementing the similarity-based methods for individual links that rely on local information. The proposed GAN-based network learning is augmented with feature selection utilizing Graph Autoencoder (GAE). We performed computational experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm for two real-life social networks (Bibliographic network and Facebook network.)"
딥러닝을 이용한 소리 분류 시 방해음의 영향 분석,2020,"['Environmental sound classification', 'Noise', 'CNN', 'VGG16', 'UrbanSound8K', 'Signal to noise ratio']",,"Environmental sound classification is an area that automatically classifies sounds in our surroundings. It can be applied to home automation, security, and surveillance. Recently, the deep learning approaches have been adopted as a classifier for increasing performance. In this method, a deep neural network is trained using many sound data, and after the learning is completed, the microphone pickup sound is applied for classification. However, during this stage, the ambient noise can be put into the microphone along with the sound to be identified. And the sound cannot be properly classified due to this disturbing noise. The recognition rate of the deep neural network decreases as the loudness of the disturbing sound increases, but the analysis about the noise effect on the classification have been limited. In this paper, we present the effect of the disturbing noise on the classification rate. For this purpose, UrbanSound8K, which is composed of 10 types of urban environmental sounds, is used for training and test data. And the VGG16-based CNN which shows good performance in image classification was adopted as a baseline model. For the disturbing noise, we use three types of sounds that are consist of daily noises (hairdryer, vacuum cleaner, faucet water, and hammer), voices(male, female, and synthesized sound), and music(cello, piano, and trumpet). In the experiment, these disturbing noises are mixed with the clean sounds so that the signal-to-noise ratio is in the range of -50dB to 50dB. Then the mixed sound was applied to a deep neural network to obtain a relative recognition rate when compared to the clean cases. The results show that the recognition rate is more than 90% compared to the clean sound cases when the SNR is between 10 and 15 dB, and 95% or more when the SNR is greater than 20 dB, regardless of the type of the disturbing sound."

텍스트 분류 기반 기계학습의 정신과 진단 예측 적용,2020,[],,"Objectives The aim was to find effective vectorization and classification models to predict a psychiatric diagnosis from text-based medical records. Methods Electronic medical records (n = 494) of present illness were collected retrospectively in inpatient admission notes with three diagnoses of major depressive disorder, type 1 bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Data were split into 400 training data and 94 independent validation data. Data were vectorized by two different models such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and Doc2vec. Machine learning models for classification including stochastic gradient descent, logistic regression, support vector classification, and deep learning (DL) were applied to predict three psychiatric diagnoses. Five-fold cross-validation was used to find an effective model. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were measured for comparison between the models. Results Five-fold cross-validation in training data showed DL model with Doc2vec was the most effective model to predict the diagnosis (accuracy = 0.87, F1-score = 0.87). However, these metrics have been reduced in independent test data set with final working DL models (accuracy = 0.79, F1-score = 0.79), while the model of logistic regression and support vector machine with Doc2vec showed slightly better performance (accuracy = 0.80, F1-score = 0.80) than the DL models with Doc2vec and others with TF-IDF. Conclusions The current results suggest that the vectorization may have more impact on the performance of classification than the machine learning model. However, data set had a number of limitations including small sample size, imbalance among the category, and its generalizability. With this regard, the need for research with multi-sites and large samples is suggested to improve the machine learning models."

Several studies have been conducted to analyze the correlation between urban green areas and heat with linear regression models. However, linear regression models have limitations explaining the correlation between heat and the multitude of variables as heat is a result of a combination of non-linear factors. This study evaluated the Heat Island alleviating effects in Seoul during the summer by using a deep neural network model methodology, which has strengths in areas where it is difficult to analyze data with existing statistical analysis methods due to variable factors and a large amount of data. Wide-area data was acquired using Landsat 8. Seoul was divided into a grid (30m x 30m) and the heat island reduction variables were enter in each grid space to create a data structure that is needed for the construction of a deep neural network using ArcGIS 10.7 and Python3.7 with Keras. This deep neural network was used to analyze the correlation between land surface temperature and the variables. We confirmed that the deep neural network model has high explanatory accuracy. It was found that the cooling effect by NDVI was the greatest, and cooling effects due to the park size and green space proximity were also shown. Previous studies showed that the cooling effects related to park size was 2℃-3℃, and the proximity effect was found to lower the temperature 0.3℃-2.3℃. There is a possibility of overestimation of the results of previous studies.

However, the historical materials of the old󰠏 and middle ages are different from those of present age, because they were created under different backgrounds in respect of political, social, economic, cultural, and ideological perspectives, and even, they are described in languages which are unavailable today. In particular, the history of the Middle Age in China had been evolved in the spaces and backgrounds different from ours, and further, it is written in ancient Chinese requiring efforts for interpretation and understanding. This necessitates the important role of instructors teaching history. Because, the thorough knowledge and deep understanding in historical materials of instructors will enable them to guide students into actual experiences of history as well as let students be interested in history further.From results of analysis on the curriculum of “History of East Asia” in 2015, the history, describing the Middle Age of China, focuses on the law and ordinance and Confucianism that maintained societies of dynasties in the Middle Age of China, thereby the textbooks, employing the curriculum, also describe the history of China by focusing on identical topics. Contents of textbooks are rather inclined to descriptions on law and ordinance, and the contents associated with Confucianism are also described in terms of institutional history comprising history of school or of state examination recruiting ranking officials by each dynasty. However, the regular rite of Confucianism is as important as the law and ordinance in the history of Middle Age of China. Contrasting to the law and ordinance, which were exploited for the direct ruling of people in each dynasty, the ‘National Rite’, which is an essential element of Confucianism, is counted as a means of indirect ruling of people through legitimacy and authority of each dynasty.Thus, the national rite of Tang Dynasty in China, the “Zhenguanli (貞觀禮)”, was employed in the present study as a historical material, to complement descriptions in textbooks of the history of East Asia. Besides, the old books (of history) of the Middle Age of China were introduced such as “Tong dian (通典)”, “Jiu Tangshu (舊唐書)”, and “Xin Tangshu (新唐書) wherein the “Zhenguanli (貞觀禮)” were included, and based on historical materials described in the “Tong dian (通典)” of the contemporary age, the features of national rite of “Zhenguanli (貞觀禮)”, which were described in the rest of two books, were examined. And further, based on descriptions in the “Zhenguanli (貞觀禮)”, the ways of instruction of historical materials for high school students were visualized."

However, the existing bone age diagnosis is a long time because it is manually diagnosed by radiologists. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep feature fusion based on contrast enhancement and superpixels for bone age diagnosis. The key idea is that the area containing information on bone ages in X-ray images is limited, and features extracted from low contrast X-ray images can lead to poor final bone age diagnostic performance.

코퍼스와 딥러닝 언어 모델을 활용한 문장 처리의 예측성과 행동 반응 시간과의 관계 연구,2020,"['predictabililty', 'surprisal', 'corpus-based language model', 'deep-learning-based language model']",,"This study examined whether the predictability is associated with the behavioral reaction times in sentence processing. The information complexity measures have been proposed to quantify the predictability for word-by-word human sentence processing. The most traditional information complexity measure is known as surprisal, which calculates relative unexpectedness at each word in a sentence (Hale 2001, Levy 2005, 2008). The most traditional information complexity measure is known as surprisal, which calculates relative unexpectedness at each word in a sentence (Hale 2001, Levy 2005, 2008), and some studies suggested that surprisal and reading times are positively correlated (Monsalve, Frank and Vigliocco 2012, Smith and Levy 2013). In order to calculate surprisal, the previous studies used one of two ways: Corpus based language models and deep learning based language models. This study, however, used both of them to analyze human reading times, comparing surprisal calculated from corpus-based language models with that calculated from deep-learning-based language models. Many studies partially investigated either of them. In this study, human reading times were analyzed by comparing surprisal calculated from corpus-based language models with that calculated from deep-learning-based language models. The results showed that surprisal calculated from corpus-based language models is more suitable to explain the behavioral reaction time data. Although the deep learning technology performs very well in the field of natural language processing, it does not seem to be human-like processing. Nonetheless, this study can contribute to the development of deep learning technology as well as computational psycholinguistic research in that it tried to compare the outcomes of corpus and deep learning technology with human behavioral responses."

This field deals with computational models that can think and act intelligently, like the human brain, and construct algorithms that can learn from data to make predictions. Artificial intelligence is becoming important in radiology due to its ability to detect abnormalities in radiographic images that are unnoticed by the naked human eye. These systems have reduced radiologists’ workload by rapidly recording and presenting data, and thereby monitoring the treatment response with a reduced risk of cognitive bias. Intelligent systems have an important role to play and could be used by dentists as an adjunct to other imaging modalities in making appropriate diagnoses and treatment plans. In the field of maxillofacial radiology, these systems have shown promise for the interpretation of complex images, accurate localization of landmarks, characterization of bone architecture, estimation of oral cancer risk, and the assessment of metastatic lymph nodes, periapical pathologies, and maxillary sinus pathologies.

The most generalized method uses the time difference between the generation of the stress wave during impact and its arrival at the surface. However, accurate measurement of the arrival time of a stress wave is fraught with difficulties. To address this issue, in this paper, we attempt to identify the signal characteristics of a stress wave corresponding to the impact location by learning the image of the stress wave signal, as measured by a Piezoelectric sensor, via deep learning without directly extracting information about the wave""s arrival time. To improve the accuracy of the measurement used in deep learning, we appropriately optimize the epoch variable and present a deep learning-based algorithm to measure the location of the impact on an aluminum plate of dimensions 1 m × 1 m. As a result, the proposed image-based NDT is successfully verified."

The salient object detection separates the object where the human eye is focused from the background, and determines the highly relevant part of the image. It is usefully used in various fields such as object tracking, detection, and recognition. Existing deep learning-based methods are mostly Autoencoder structures, and many feature losses occur in encoders that compress and extract features and decoders that decompress and extend the extracted features. These losses cause the salient object area to be lost or detect the background as an object. In the proposed method, Saliency Attention is proposed to reduce the feature loss and suppress the background region in the Autoencoder structure. The influence of the feature values was determined using the ELU activation function, and Attention was performed on the feature values in the normalized negative and positive regions, respectively.

This is changing human life, and literary research is no exception. In line with these changes, this paper is an attempt to explore new classical research methodologies for the changing times in terms of the use of digital analysis techniques. For this purpose, out of 4,736 sijo works contained in the “Korean Sijo Dictionary” (Park Eul-Su, Asiaculturehistory publishing house, 1992), 4,127 sijo works were conducted, with the exception of janghyeong sijo, to conduct digital analysis using hierarchical analysis and deep learning.  First of all, through hierarchical analysis, 13 writers with more than 30 episodes were analyzed for the similarity of the progenitor, and as a result, four groups with similar vocabulary and vocabulary combinations were extracted. Next, through deep learning, we have implemented a model that can predict the age of creation of sijo for works from 1600 to 1800s. Although the accuracy of the predictions was not the same for each period, it was possible to predict the date in which the unknown works of the artist were created in the future and to examine the characteristics of the works by regiment. Finally, we took a step further from the traditional search method in which only the morphemes were able to search for matching sijos, and implemented deep learning semantic search for sijo. This enabled the extraction of works with similar meaning in content in order of high similarity, even if the keywords or sentences that were to be searched and the morphemes did not match. I think this will be meaningful in that it will significantly reduce the time required to classify and analyze vast amounts of sijo works by subject or keyword.  Although research methods using digital analysis techniques discussed above may not replace traditional research methods, it is hoped that they will be able to secure their own significance in that they are seeking and attempting new research methods in line with the trend of the new era."

In this paper, an experiment was conducted to find out the compression efficiency and the effect of encoding on task inference performance when the features extracted in the intermediate stage of CNN are encoded. The feature map that combines the features of 256 channels into one image and the original image were encoded in HEVC to compare and analyze the inference performance for object detection and segmentation. Since the intermediate feature map encodes the five levels of feature maps (P2 to P6), the image size and resolution are increased compared to the original image. However, when the degree of compression is weakened, the use of feature maps yields similar or better inference results to the inference performance of the original image."

This vibration data is also used to diagnose motor failures in machine learning. However, there are many types of electric motors used in the industry, and the environment can vary according to the proposed use. To diagnose motor failure, data must be collected, labeled, and learned. In this way, it is very difficult to collect and label vibration data in consideration of all situations. For example, in identical situations, even if only the sensor changes, the CNN-only algorithm can fail to classify the data. In this paper, a method of learning CNN with learning data created by automatically classifying and labeling data using K-means is proposed. To apply K-means to fault diagnosis, FFT data was divided by frequency. For each frequency, the K-means algorithm was applied to calculate the centroid. The training data was used to calculate the similarity and distance to the centroid of the classified clusters. Using the calculated results, the centroid classified as the K-means was reclassified as normal or fault. This method using the K-menas could classify data, even if various data were entered. Finally, CNN was trained using the generated training data. Using this process, the existing CNN-only algorithm failed to classify the data when the sensor was altered, but the proposed algorithm classified the data and showed high accuracy."

In this paper, we propose a technology that uses the latest deep-learning technology and OpenCV library to quickly search for a specific person in a video; the search is based on the clothing information that is inputted by the user and transmits the result in real time. We implemented our system to automatically recognize specific human objects in real time by using the YOLO library, whilst deep learning technology is used to classify human clothes into top/bottom clothes. Colors are also detected through the OpenCV library which are then all combined to identify the requested object. The system presented in this paper not only accurately and quickly recognizes a person object with a specific clothing, but also has a potential extensibility that can be used for other types of object recognition in a video surveillance system for various purposes."

From the 60-min list-mode data, we generated a total of 100 data bins with 10-s duration. We also generated 40-s-long data by adding four non-overlapping 10-s bins and 300-s-long reference data by adding all list-mode data.We employed U-Net that is widely used for various tasks in biomedical imaging to train and test proposed denoising models.Results All the N2C, N2N, and Nr2N were effective for improving the noisy inputs. While N2N showed equivalent PSNR to the N2C in all the noise levels, Nr2N yielded higher SSIM than N2N.

In this paper, we propose a fingerprint positioning network based on radio map encoding that can rebuild the positioning systems with only a small amount of additional learning by solving this data dependency. The proposed network comprises an encoding network that uses a radio map as a feature vector and a location network that estimates the location based on the measured Wi-Fi signal. By vectorizing the radio map, the encoding network can recover by only re-measurement of the service space even if the environment changes. In addition, as the positioning network estimates the cur-rent location by considering the past location, the estimation accuracy is high even when the noise in the Wi-Fi signal becomes se-vere.

Therefore, detecting the fault of such auxiliary equipment in advance is difficult. Thus, the diagnosis of auxiliary equipment at a less cost is important for minimizing the downtime due to the fault of the equipment. In this paper, we introduce a diagnosis method for auxiliary equipment in power plants using rule-based and deep-learning algorithms. First, we calculate the probability of cause of a fault from current symptoms by using the rule-based algorithm. The rule used in this algorithm is established based on expert experience. We then conduct orbit detection using a convolution neural network. This algorithm self-learns the filter to classify orbit images as normal, rubbing, and unbalanced. The weakness of the deep-learning algorithm can be compensated by combining the results of the aforementioned methods."

CNN을 이용한 태양전지 불량 검출,2020,"['solar cell', 'defects detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', '.']",,"The efficiency of solar panel power production is greatly influenced by the state of the panel. Therefore, it can be said that it is an important factor to check whether a solar cell is damaged in managing solar power. Existing solar cell damage detection technology detects whether the solar cell is damaged by an electroluminescence phenomenon or by checking the degree of scattering by shining a laser. In this study, we attempt to detect the damage of the solar cell by using the deep learning method and taking the surface image of the solar cell without additional measuring device. When using the existing electroluminescence phenomenon, a separate device must be configured to check for damage, and there is a disadvantage in that the use of the connected cell must be stopped to confirm a part. The method of checking the degree of scattering by illuminating the laser has a disadvantage that many areas cannot be seen at once. To improve this, this paper presents a detection method based on deep learning. We present an algorithm that is based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Experimental results according to model size and data augmentation are given to show the feasibility of proposed method."

To address this problem, recent studies applied word embedding techniques, originally developed for natural language processing, and derived positive results in terms of dimensional reduction and accuracy of the prediction model.

Today there are many software programs applying machine learning in various fields including image synthesis and video editing. The computer is used in almost every stage of the animation production process these days, which raised a need to understand the concept of AI and examine and arrange AI-based software functions in the viewpoint of users instead of developers. The investigator thus arranged the basics and examined the ways that they were applied to software by making use of the images and concept diagrams made by himself so that any people could understand them.The findings show that Adobe Photoshop encompassed most of the various software functions based on AI in the field of image synthesis. In the field of video editing, Premiere featured completely different functions not found in other AI-based video editing programs. Unlike other AI-based video editing programs designed to select videos according to given texts or music and make it easy for common people to use them for creative purposes, Premiere has a goal of professional video editing and image correction as a universal tool.Animation is an attractive work of video that adolescents and youths like, providing creative texts to depict the fast-evolving times. Those who are involved in the field of animation need to have an open mind and attitude to make efforts to apply something new to the entire process from planning to production. It is expected that more applications and platforms will be created capable of easy and fun creation based on AI. The production of animation has pursued the goal of creating storytelling video content. In the future, it will be important to employ a broader viewpoint to develop content in the forms of creative tools that anyone can enjoy including machine learning developers based on the planning abilities and production skills.

Low-dose CT Image Denoising Using Classification Densely Connected Residual Network,2020,"['low-dose CT', 'image denoising', 'convolutional neural network', 'dense connection', 'residual learning']",,"Considering that high-dose X-ray radiation during CT scans may bring potential risks to patients, in the medical imaging industry there has been increasing emphasis on low-dose CT. Due to complex statistical characteristics of noise found in low-dose CT images, many traditional methods are difficult to preserve structural details effectively while suppressing noise and artifacts. Inspired by the deep learning techniques, we propose a densely connected residual network (DCRN) for low-dose CT image noise cancelation, which combines the ideas of dense connection with residual learning. On one hand, dense connection maximizes information flow between layers in the network, which is beneficial to maintain structural details when denoising images. On the other hand, residual learning paired with batch normalization would allow for decreased training speed and better noise reduction performance in images. The experiments are performed on the 100 CT images selected from a public medical dataset―TCIA(The Cancer Imaging Archive). Compared with the other three competitive denoising algorithms, both subjective visual effect and objective evaluation indexes which include PSNR, RMSE, MAE and SSIM show that the proposed network can improve LDCT images quality more effectively while maintaining a low computational cost.

Robots are installed to clean the air duct at low cost, but they are still not fully automated and depend on manpower. In this study, an intersection detection algorithm for autonomous driving was applied to an air duct cleaning robot. Autonomous driving of the robot was achieved by calculating the distance and angle between the extracted point and the center point through the intersection detection algorithm from the camera image mounted on the robot. The training data consisted of CAD images of the duct interior as well as the cross-point coordinates and angles between the two boundary lines. The deep learning-based CNN model was applied as a detection algorithm. For training, the cross-point coordinates were obtained from CAD images. The accuracy was determined based on the differences in the actual and predicted areas and distances. A cleaning robot prototype was designed, consisting of a frame, a Raspberry Pi computer, a control unit and a drive unit. The algorithm was validated by video imagery of the robot in operation. The algorithm can be applied to vehicles operating in similar environments."

Developments in image acquisition/reconstruction, especially the time-of-flight and point spread function, have potential advantages in the image signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution. Modern detector materials and devices (including lutetium oxyorthosilicate, cadmium zinc tellurium, and silicon photomultiplier) as well as modern nuclear medicine imaging systems (including positron emission tomography [PET]/computerized tomography [CT], whole-body PET, PET/magnetic resonance [MR], and digital PET) enable not only high-quality digital image acquisition, but also subsequent image processing, including image reconstruction and post-reconstruction methods. Moreover, theranostics in nuclear medicine extend the usefulness of nuclear medicine physics far more than quantitative image-based diagnosis, playing a key role in personalized/precision medicine by raising the importance of internal radiation dosimetry in nuclear medicine. Now that deep-learning-based image processing can be incorporated in nuclear medicine image acquisition/processing, the aforementioned fields of nuclear medicine physics face the new era of Industry 4.0. Ongoing technological developments in nuclear medicine physics are leading to enhanced image quality and decreased radiation exposure as well as quantitative and personalized healthcare."

An EEG is an approach that records the electrical activity in the brain, and EEG-based affection recognition is a technique used for quantitatively recognizing human emotion by analysing the recorded signals. Decision-makers’ subjective reactions toward architectural design alternatives may play a key role in the architectural planning and design stage. In this regard, the proposed model enables the quantitative recognition of their preferences and supports architects in the planning and design stages. The suggested model classifies the recorded data using a deep-learning technique. To build the model, an EEG recording experiment was conducted with 18 subjects, who were asked to select their most/least preferred images among eight images of small-housing design. Post recording, a positive and negative affect schedule questionnaire was distributed to the subjects to rate their affection. Google TensorFlow and Keras were used to structure the model. After training, precision, recall, and f1 score metrics were used to evaluate and validate the model. This model can help designers to evaluate design alternatives in terms of decision-making. Moreover, as this model uses biosignal data, which is universal to humans, architectural design processes for children, the elderly, etc., may be supported. Furthermore, a data-driven design database may be proposed in a future research for cross-validating with previous methods such as interviews and observations."

The first method is to process the incomplete data by assigning the missing value with equal probability that the missing variable can have, and learn this data with the SVM. This technique ensures that the higher the frequency of missing for any variable, the higher the entropy so that it is not selected in the decision tree. This method is characterized by ignoring all remaining information in the missing variable and assigning a new value. On the other hand, the new method is to calculate the entropy probability from the remaining information except the missing value and use it as an estimate of the missing variable. In other words, using a lot of information that is not lost from incomplete learning data to recover some missing information and learn using deep learning.

Furthermore, it is easier to explain the subject in relation to the world and the mind by the Buddhist epistemology based on the Alaya-Vijnana System, and this understanding will contribute to solving the controversy about ‘the first knowledge,’ which has been called Meno’s Paradox and has been challenging when explaining a subject’s learning-internalization. Also, by the curriculum establishing a class as the interaction between the teachers’ and students’ perceptions of the complex interaction between surface and deep perceptions, it is possible to explain class dynamics more specifically, which will be an opportunity to explain the relationship between curriculum education and personality education."

As a result of the experiment, the age estimation accuracy of 5,328 images for the performance test of the age estimation method is about 85%, and the gender estimation accuracy is about 98%. It is expected that real-time age recognition will be possible beyond feature extraction of face images if studies on the construction of a larger data set, pre-processing methods, and various network structures and activation functions have been made to classify the age classes that are further subdivided according to age."

The milestone breakthrough of machine learning technology represented by deep learning makes the application of artificial intelligence deeply integrate into human social life. Many countries have accelerated the development of artificial intelligence technology. Nowadays, technology and law are deeply integrated and more and more high-quality legal artificial intelligence products have been produced. The legal risks arising from this cannot be ignored, and these countries also have began to study the risks of artificial intelligence application in the judicial field.The relationship between artificial intelligence and law is not a simple superposition, but a cross penetration. Therefore, the investigation of artificial intelligence in the judicial field requires thinking about paths, limits, and risks that are the integration of the technical field with the goal of economy and efficiency and the judicial field with “fairness and justice” as the value pursuit. To achieve the goals above, this paper will combine artificial intelligence technology knowledge and legal knowledge to discuss. This paper will review the historical development of typical judicial applications of artificial intelligence represented by legal information retrieval systems and legal expert systems. And then, the paper will clarify the working principles of core artificial intelligence technology represented by knowledge maps, natural language processing, and machine learning. And next, the paper will combine the abstract characteristics of legal terminology and the flexibility of legal application to reflect on the reasons for the low conformity of artificial intelligence technology in the judicial field. At last, based on the above analysis, the paper will propose improvement suggestions for judicial big data acquisition, legal information extraction, and AI model research from two aspects of technology improvement and legal regulation."

A lot of studies have been performed to improve CT image quality while reducing radiation dose. Recently, deep learning-based techniques for improving CT image quality have been developed and show superior performance compared to conventional techniques. In this study, a super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) model was used to improve the spatial resolution of CT images, and image quality according to the hyperparameters, which determine the performance of the SRCNN model, was evaluated in order to verify the effect of hyperparameters on the SRCNN model.

High-Capacity Robust Image Steganography via Adversarial Network,2020,"['Steganography', 'steganalysis', 'high-capacity', 'robustness', 'adversarial network']",,"Steganography has been successfully employed in various applications, e.g., copyright control of materials, smart identity cards, video error correction during transmission, etc. Deep learning-based steganography models can hide information adaptively through network learning, and they draw much more attention. However, the capacity, security, and robustness of the existing deep learning-based steganography models are still not fully satisfactory. In this paper, three models for different cases, i.e., a basic model, a secure model, a secure and robust model, have been proposed for different cases. In the basic model, the functions of high-capacity secret information hiding and extraction have been realized through an encoding network and a decoding network respectively. The high-capacity steganography is implemented by hiding a secret image into a carrier image having the same resolution with the help of concat operations, InceptionBlock and convolutional layers. Moreover, the secret image is hidden into the channel B of carrier image only to resolve the problem of color distortion. In the secure model, to enhance the security of the basic model, a steganalysis network has been added into the basic model to form an adversarial network. In the secure and robust model, an attack network has been inserted into the secure model to improve its robustness further. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed secure model and the secure and robust model have an overall better performance than some existing high-capacity deep learning-based steganography models. The secure model performs best in invisibility and security. The secure and robust model is the most robust against some attacks."

However, rainfall that causes flooding does not appear every year in a single urban basin, meaning it is difficultto collect enough data for deep learning. Therefore, in addition to the rainfall observed in the study area, the observed rainfall in anotherurban basin was applied in the predictive model. The LSTM neural network was used for predicting the total overflow, and the resultof the SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) was applied as target data. The prediction of the inundation map was performed byusing logistic regression; the independent variable was the total overflow and the dependent variable was the presence or absence offlooding in each grid. The dependent variable of logistic regression was collected through the simulation results of a two-dimensionalflood model. The input data of the two-dimensional flood model were the overflow at each manhole calculated by the SWMM.According to the LSTM neural network parameters, the prediction results of total overflow were compared.

A Graph Embedding Technique for Weighted Graphs Based on LSTM Autoencoders,2020,"['Graph Embedding', 'Graph Similarity', 'LSTM Autoencoder', 'Weighted Graph Embedding', 'Weighted Graph']",,"A graph is a data structure consisting of nodes and edges between these nodes. Graph embedding is to generate a low dimensional vector for a given graph that best represents the characteristics of the graph. Recently, there have been studies on graph embedding, especially using deep learning techniques. However, until now, most deep learning-based graph embedding techniques have focused on unweighted graphs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph embedding technique for weighted graphs based on long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoders. Given weighted graphs, we traverse each graph to extract node-weight sequences from the graph. Each node-weight sequence represents a path in the graph consisting of nodes and the weights between these nodes. We then train an LSTM autoencoder on the extracted node-weight sequences and encode each nodeweight sequence into a fixed-length vector using the trained LSTM autoencoder. Finally, for each graph, we collect the encoding vectors obtained from the graph and combine them to generate the final embedding vector for the graph. These embedding vectors can be used to classify weighted graphs or to search for similar weighted graphs. The experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed method is effective in measuring the similarity between weighted graphs."

Therefore, most of vaccines have recognized these drawbacks and additionally make use of “heuristic” techniques. This paper proposes a technology to detecting unknown malicious code using deep learning. In addition, detecting malware skill using Supervisor Learning approach has a clear limitation.

From its inception, Virtual Reality has been distinctly effective at providing immersive perspective-taking experiences. However, for this project, we focused on the use of a VR-enhanced environment as an introspective tool. To accomplish this, we constructed a transdisciplinary study by creating a Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning virtual reality environment, called Sunghaksipdo VR. The purpose of this study is to explore technological opportunities for cultivating a public understanding of Neo-Confucianism by creating “Taegukdo”, the first diagram in the Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning. First, we examined three background theories: Neo-Confucianism, virtual reality for the Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning, and spiritual experience.

The problem that should be pre-determined rather than securing programming design ability for AMA implementation is the philosophical, psychological and neurological understanding of morality. Since moral judgment requires a high level of mental ability, it is hard to conclude that AI's moral decision-making ability has been secured just by reproducing human cognitive abilities such as memory and logic reasoning. AI morality is modeled on human morality and moral judgment, so as a moral agent, it is necessary to consider all aspects of the morality, including the accumulation of moral experience, moral emotion, the securing of the complexity of morality, and the relationship. The biggest task left for mankind to overcome AI myths and produce AMA as an ideal moral agent is a deep sarcasm about what kind of morality should be implemented. Based on this, it is necessary to consider the technical question of whether computers with this moral character are accessible by deep learning. Moral robots are required not only to have deep-rooted human emotional goals such as happiness, but also to have moral awareness, emotion, will, intuition, insight and practical skills surrounding moral judgment. For the realization of AMA, an understanding of the morality of computer engineer, ethicist and neuroscience should be cross-referenced. The question remains whether AI will create as diverse moral character as humans or realize the best moral human image that mankind should pursue. AI morality creates AI myths like neuromyths and demands more moral philosophy and ethical exploration of human beings in their approach to morality, as well as neuropsychological and neurological exploration. This calls for combining insights from moral psychology and neuroscience as well as moral philosophy and ethical considerations of certain moral principles, such as reciprocity and fairness, in order to provide engineers with data explaining the role of emotional computing and emotional intelligence in moral decision making."
Real-time Depth Estimation Using Recurrent CNN with Sparse Depth Cues for SLAM System,2020,"['Deep learning', 'depth estimation', 'geometry recovery', 'SLAM', 'vision based navigation']",,"Depth map has been utilized for refinement of geometric information in a variety of fields such as 3D reconstruction and pose estimation in SLAM system where ill-posed problems are occurred. Currently, as learning-based approaches are successfully introduced throughout many problems of vision-based fields, several depth estimation algorithms based on CNN are suggested, which only conduct training of spatial information. Since an image sequence or video used for SLAM system tends to have temporal information, this paper proposes a recurrent CNN architecture for SLAM system to estimate depth map by exploring not only spatial but also temporal information by using convolutional GRU cell, which is constructed to remember weights of past convolutional layers. Furthermore, this paper proposes using additional layers that preserve structure of scenes by utilizing sparse depth cues obtained from SLAM system. The sparse depth cues are produced by projecting reconstructed 3D map into each camera frame, and the sparse cues help to predict accurate depth map avoiding ambiguity of depth map generation of untrained structures in latent space. Despite accuracy of depth cues according to monocular SLAM system degrades than stereo SLAM system, the proposed masking approach, which takes the confidence of depth cues with regard to a relative camera pose between current frame and previous frame, retains the performance of the proposed system with the proposed adaptive regularization in loss function. In the training phase, by preprocessing exponential quantization of ground-truth depth map to eliminate the ill-effects of the captured large distances, the depth map prediction of the proposed system improves more than other baseline methods with accomplishment of real-time system. We expect that this proposed system can be used in SLAM system to refine geometric information for more accurate 3D reconstruction and pose estimation, which are essential parts for robust navigation system of robots."

Artificial intelligence cannot be an object of moral consideration, because it does not have self-interest. The counterarguments to this would be that AI capable of self-interest might emerge in the future, and that the function of self-interest could be programmed into AI. I will reply to these two possible counterarguments."

Noise in industrial sites causes hearing loss in workers, and researches on noise cancellation have been widely conducted. However, the conventional methods have a problem of blocking all sounds and cannot provide the optimal operation per noise type because of common cancellation method for all types of noise. In order to perform selective noise cancellation, therefore, we propose a method for environmental sound classification based on deep learning. The proposed method uses new sets of acoustic features consisting of temporal and statistical properties of Mel-spectrogram, which can overcome the limitation of Mel-spectrogram features, and uses convolutional neural network as a classifier. We apply the proposed method to five-class sound classification with three noise classes and two non-noise classes. We confirm that the proposed method provides improved classification accuracy by 6.6% point, compared with that using conventional Mel-spectrogram features."

The data used in this research are images of the railroad surface with one or more defect regions. Railroad images were cropped to a suitable size, considering the long height and relatively narrow width of the images. They were also normalized based on the variance and mean of the data images. Using these images, the suggested model was trained to segment the defect regions. The proposed method showed promising results in the segmentation of defects. We consider that the proposed method can facilitate decision-making about railroad maintenance, and potentially be applied for other analyses."

There are various techniques for fine tuning the language models and this paper examines three techniques, which are data augmentation, tuning the hyper paramters and partly re-constructing the neural networks. For data augmentation, we use no-answer augmentation and back-translation method. Also, some useful combinations of hyper parameters are observed by conducting a number of experiments. Finally, we have GRU, LSTM networks to boost our model performance with adding those networks to BERT pre-trained model. We do fine-tuning the pre-trained korean-based language model through the methods mentioned above and push the F1 score from baseline up to 89.66.

We've proved that each micro-drones have their own distinguishable MFCC feature and confirmed that we can apply CNN as a detector and classifier even though drone sound has time-related sequence. Typically many papers deal with RNN for time-related features, but we prove that if the number of frame in the MFCC features are enough to contain the time-related information, we can classify those features with CNN. With this approach, we've achieved high detection and classification ratio with low-computation power at the same time using the data set which consists of four different drone sounds.

Automatic Sagittal Plane Detection for the Identification of the Mandibular Canal,2020,"['자동 평면 검출', '합성곱 신경망', '변환 최적화', '치아 임플란트 계획.', 'Automatic plane detection', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Transformation optimization', 'Dental implant planning.']",,"Identification of the mandibular canal path in Computed Tomography (CT) scans is important in dental implantology. Typically, prior to the implant planning, dentists find a sagittal plane where the mandibular canal path is maximally observed, to manually identify the mandibular canal. However, this is time-consuming and requires extensive experience. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based framework to detect the desired sagittal plane automatically. This is accomplished by utilizing two main techniques: 1) a modified version of the iterative transformation network (ITN) method for obtaining initial planes, and 2) a fine searching method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for detecting the desirable sagittal plane. This combination of techniques facilitates accurate plane detection, which is a limitation of the stand-alone ITN method. We have tested on a number of CT datasets to demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more satisfactory results compared to the ITN method. This allows dentists to identify the mandibular canal path efficiently, providing a foundation for future research into more efficient, automatic mandibular canal detection methods."

Finally, we apply two real-world fault cases to compare the performance of the autoencoder-based fault detection system with the PCA-based fault detection system using a FAR(False Alarm Rate), which is a representative fault detection performance index."

CNN을 활용한 방송 뉴스의 감정 분석,2020,[],,"In Korea, video-based news broadcasters are primarily classified into terrestrial broadcasters, general programming cable broadcasters and YouTube broadcasters. Recently, news broadcasters get subjective while targeting the desired specific audience. This violates normative expectations of impartiality and neutrality on journalism from its audience. This phenomenon may have a negative impact on audience perceptions of issues. This study examined whether broadcast news reporting conveys emotions and if so, how news broadcasters differ according to emotion type. Emotion types were classified into neutrality, happiness, sadness and anger using a convolutional neural network which is a class of deep neural networks. Results showed that news anchors or reporters tend to express their emotions during TV broadcasts regardless of broadcast systems. This study provides the first quantative investigation of emotions in broadcasting news. In addition, this study is the first deep learning-based approach to emotion analysis of broadcasting news."

The proposed system will enable the use of smart devices as educational media for children. A deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) is used for generating a new image. Three steps are involved in training DCGAN. Firstly, images with 11 titles and 1,164 images on ImageNet are learned. Secondly, Tesseract, an optical character recognition engine, is used to extract images and text from kids’ book and classify the text using a morpheme analyzer. Thirdly, the classified word class is matched with the latent vector of the image. The learned DCGAN creates an image associated with the text."

Since the viewing angle is limited to generate the content through a general camera, image stitching is mainly used to combine images taken with multiple cameras into one image having a wide field of view. However, if the parallax between the cameras is large, parallax distortion may occur in the stitched image, which disturbs the users content immersion, thus an image stitching overcoming parallax distortion is required. The existing Seam Optimization based image stitching method to overcome parallax distortion uses energy function or object segment information to reflect the location information of objects, but the initial seam generation location, background information, performance of the object detector, and placement of objects may limit application. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an image stitching method that can overcome the limitations of the existing method by adding a weight value set differently according to the type of object to the energy value using object detection based on deep learning."

The proposed driver’s condition warning system using eye aspect ratio consists of a camera, that is required to detect eyes, the Raspberrypie that processes information on eyes from the camera, buzzer and vibrator, that are required to warn the driver. In order to detect and recognize driver’s eyes, the histogram of oriented gradients and face landmark estimation based on deep-learning are used. Initially the system calculates the eye aspect ratio of the driver from 6 coordinates around the eye and then gets each eye aspect ratio values when the eyes are opened and closed. These two different eye aspect ratio values are used to calculate the threshold value that is necessary to determine the eye state. Because the threshold value is adaptively determined according to the driver’s eye aspect ratio, the system can use the optimal threshold value to determine the driver’s condition. In addition, the system synthesizes an input image from the gray-scaled and LAB model images to operate in low lighting conditions."

However, when one pronounces words, phrases, or sentences, the pronunciation changes in a manner of a wide variation and complexity at the boundaries of syllables, and the association of notation and pronunciation does not hold any more. Consequently, it is very difficult for foreign learners to study Korean standard pronunciations. Despite these difficulties, it is believed that systematic analysis of pronunciation errors for Korean words is possible according to the advantageous observations that the relationship between Korean notations and pronunciations can be described as a set of firm rules without exceptions unlike other languages including English. In this paper, we propose a visualization framework which shows the differences between standard pronunciations and erratic ones as quantitative measures on the computer screen. Previous researches only show color representation and 3D graphics of speech properties, or an animated view of changing shapes of lips and mouth cavity. Moreover, the features used in the analysis are only point data such as the average of a speech range. In this study, we propose a method which can directly use the time-series data instead of using summary or distorted data. This was realized by using the deep learning-based technique which combines Self-organizing map, variational autoencoder model, and Markov model, and we achieved a superior performance enhancement compared to the method using the point-based data."

As the average temperature on earth is continuously increasing, and the rate of increase is accelerating due to global warming caused by climate change, various studies have been conducted to diagnose heat wave-related vulnerabilities in cities; this is one of the phenomena that is most directly exacerbated by global warming. Among various research frameworks used to analyze heat waves, this study adopts the vulnerability evaluation framework proposed in the IPCC comprehensive report on climate change. Method: This study looks at an overall research trend in the field of climate change, which is vulnerability to heat waves. Using the SciVal tool, we collected and analyzed information on keywords, citation counts, and country of publication of published studies to confirm the overall trend of research in the field of climate change. Finally, this study analyzes relevant studies that investigated heat waves, vulnerability, and major issues in heat wave vulnerability. Google Academic aided in choosing studies published between 2010 and 2019. The following key words were used individually and in combination as inclusion criteria: heat wave, vulnerability, risk, climate change, heat index, multiple regression, machine learning, ANN, and deep learning. Result: A total of 23 papers were selected for the analysis. First, the methodological trends were categorized into four groups by purpose. The four purposes were vulnerable (hot) spot extraction, phenomenon review, analysis of heat-related indicators, and predictive model development. The studies mainly focus on developed countries rather than developing countries. Second, the material trends were categorized using the sectors of the IPCC vulnerability analysis framework, i.e. exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The results showed that, in previous studies, many indicators were used in the sectors of exposure and sensitivity, while relatively few indicators were used in the sector of adaptive capacity."

Jipsul was written to analyze problems which were caused by rapid changes of Suwon but also to propose a plan for ordinary people economic fundamentals. This study examines the policy development of country village(鄕村) and Lee Seok-Jo s theory of reformation in Suwon in the Jeongjo era of late 18th-century Chosun. Lee Seok-Jo was the one who was influenced by Song Si-Yeol(宋時烈) learning. Jipsul consists of four books of Won(元)·Hyeung(亨)·Ri(利)·Jung(貞); it draws a line between Naepyun(內篇) and Woaepyun(外篇) in content. In this way, it is meaningful; Lee Seok-Jo clarified his study was based on 『Banguesurock(磻溪隧錄)』 of Ye Hyeong-Won(柳馨遠), his learned role-model, because Yu was in Lee s opposite fraction. The first point that Lee Seok-Jo recognized in 『Jipsul』 was Yanghyunjae, emphasizing the significance of education in order to build a new village in Suwon. In other words, he insists that they should be educated by combining Bangrijae(坊里制), and should be selected according to Gonggeujae(貢擧制). Lee Seok-Jo noticed that decayed scholars influence on agriculture, industry, and commerce led to the expansion of the whole social problem. Although Lee Seok-Jo declared that Jungjunjae(井田制) should be practiced, because of the realistic difficulty of the implement, he designed the implement of Hanjunja(限田制). Lee Seok-Jo tried to provide land of 50 Bu(負) to Junin(田人), and distribute land by determining Gyeulbu(結負) according to the status in order to prevent negative effects which were caused whenever Gyeulbu was determined every year. Likewise, Lee Seok-Jo s land reform theory was the method to adjust the rate of landholding via gradual land redistribution. Lee Seok-Jo s commercial theory for the industrial development of Suwon was the reasonable plan based on ‘Mubonbomal(務本補末).’ This was the plan to make Suwon a commercial province of Hannam(漢南) which was the center of the materials and a central distribution of commodities(物貨). In addition, he insisted to make a post town by moving three stations(三驛) into around Suwon. As seen in Lee Seok-Jo s current affairs theory in 『Jipsul』, he suggested a practical alternative from a national perspective. Regardless of any political fraction, 『Jipsul』 was a social reform plan which was designed for ordinary people s life stability."

The research is classified into the introduction and application of urban hygiene, the institutionalization of urban hygiene, and the building of the urban sanitation infrastructure, and the contents to be supplemented for the development of urban hygiene research.  The most salient decisive moment in urban hygiene theory is the discovery of the germ theory in modern China. Though the Chinese doctors have learned Western medicine in Japan, bacteriology has become an essential theory. Surprisingly, the germ theory was likewise used in traditional Chinese medicine. Nevertheless, studies conducted in the past highlight the influence of experts rather than the general public. It is essential to examine normal people""s lives and inspect the merging of theory and reality. In fact, this problem appears in the theoretical study of urban hygiene, as well as the entire study of urban hygiene.  The study on institutional sanitary introduction was condemned for its modernist view that emphasizes the impact of Western culture and Japan. It was specifically analyzed how the imperial hygienic health care system affected modern China. This led to studies focused on the sanitary system from a national constructive perspective.  Likewise, they released studies that concentrate on hygiene administration of local governments such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. Focusing on the control over the daily life and political power; and the control of infectious diseases and hygiene campaigns, it was revealed that the establishment of the urban hygiene system was flawed because of deep-rooted traditional ideas, political instability, and lack of funds.  The modification of the urban environment can be classified into the construction of water and sewage facilities and the treatment of night soil and garbage. There are studies that examined how the urban development project was constructed and how it influenced people""s lives. The maintenance of the urban development is a key example of how the urban sanitation method is built. It likewise states that the state pressured the control of the private sector in the process of establishing an urban sanitation system; at the same time, collaborating with the private sector.  At this point, urban hygiene study was conducted primarily by the city. However, after the case study has commenced at some point, a trial must be initiated to identify the overall perspective of Chinese urban hygiene. It is also compulsory to stage comparative research. Comparing countries in East Asia with similar elements, and conducting studies of rural areas in China, will facilitate in identifying the features of Chinese urban sanitation history."

By releasing deep learning open source software to the public, the relationship with the developer community and the artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem can be strengthened, and users can perform experiment, implementation and improvement of it. Accordingly, the field of machine learning is growing rapidly, and developers are using and reproducing various learning algorithms in each field. Although various analysis of open source software has been made, there is a lack of studies to help develop or use deep learning open source software in the industry. This study thus attempts to derive a strategy for adopting the framework through case studies of a deep learning open source framework.  Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and literature review related to the adoption of open source software, we employed the case study framework that includes technological factors as perceived relative advantage, perceived compatibility, perceived complexity, and perceived trialability, organizational factors as management support and knowledge & expertise, and environmental factors as availability of technology skills and services, and platform long term viability. We conducted a case study analysis of three companies adoption cases (two cases of success and one case of failure) and revealed that seven out of eight TOE factors and several factors regarding company, team and resource are significant for the adoption of deep learning open source framework. By organizing the case study analysis results, we provided five important success factors for adopting deep learning framework: the knowledge and expertise of developers in the team, hardware (GPU) environment, data enterprise cooperation system, deep learning framework platform, deep learning framework work tool service.  In order for an organization to successfully adopt a deep learning open source framework, at the stage of using the framework, first, the hardware (GPU) environment for AI R&D group must support the knowledge and expertise of the developers in the team. Second, it is necessary to support the use of deep learning frameworks by research developers through collecting and managing data inside and outside the company with a data enterprise cooperation system. Third, deep learning research expertise must be supplemented through cooperation with researchers from academic institutions such as universities and research institutes. Satisfying three procedures in the stage of using the deep learning framework, companies will increase the number of deep learning research developers, the ability to use the deep learning framework, and the support of GPU resource. In the proliferation stage of the deep learning framework, fourth, a company makes the deep learning framework platform that improves the research efficiency and effectiveness of the developers, for example, the optimization of the hardware (GPU) environment automatically. Fifth, the deep learning framework tool service team complements the developers expertise through sharing the information of the external deep learning open source framework community to the in-house community and activating developer retraining and seminars.  To implement the identified five success factors, a step-by-step enterprise procedure for adoption of the deep learning framework was proposed: defining the project problem, confirming whether the deep learning methodology is the right method, confirming whether the deep learning framework is the right tool, using the deep learning framework by the enterprise, spreading the framework of the enterprise. The first three steps (i.e. defining the project problem, confirming whether the deep learning methodology is the right method, and confirming whether the deep learning framewo"
전문성 이식을 통한 딥러닝 기반 전문 이미지 해석 방법론,2020,"['딥러닝', '전문성 이식', '전이 학습', '이미지 캡셔닝', '인공지능', 'Deep Learning', 'Expertise Transplant', 'Transfer-Learning', 'Image Captioning', 'Artificial Intelligence']",,"Recently, as deep learning has attracted attention, the use of deep learning is being considered as a method for solving problems in various fields. In particular, deep learning is known to have excellent performance when applied to applying unstructured data such as text, sound and images, and many studies have proven its effectiveness. Owing to the remarkable development of text and image deep learning technology, interests in image captioning technology and its application is rapidly increasing. Image captioning is a technique that automatically generates relevant captions for a given image by handling both image comprehension and text generation simultaneously. In spite of the high entry barrier of image captioning that analysts should be able to process both image and text data, image captioning has established itself as one of the key fields in the A.I. research owing to its various applicability. In addition, many researches have been conducted to improve the performance of image captioning in various aspects. Recent researches attempt to create advanced captions that can not only describe an image accurately, but also convey the information contained in the image more sophisticatedly.  Despite many recent efforts to improve the performance of image captioning, it is difficult to find any researches to interpret images from the perspective of domain experts in each field not from the perspective of the general public. Even for the same image, the part of interests may differ according to the professional field of the person who has encountered the image. Moreover, the way of interpreting and expressing the image also differs according to the level of expertise. The public tends to recognize the image from a holistic and general perspective, that is, from the perspective of identifying the image’s constituent objects and their relationships. On the contrary, the domain experts tend to recognize the image by focusing on some specific elements necessary to interpret the given image based on their expertise. It implies that meaningful parts of an image are mutually different depending on viewers perspective even for the same image. So, image captioning needs to implement this phenomenon.  Therefore, in this study, we propose a method to generate captions specialized in each domain for the image by utilizing the expertise of experts in the corresponding domain. Specifically, after performing pre-training on a large amount of general data, the expertise in the field is transplanted through transfer-learning with a small amount of expertise data. However, simple adaption of transfer learning using expertise data may invoke another type of problems. Simultaneous learning with captions of various characteristics may invoke so-called ‘inter-observation interference’ problem, which make it difficult to perform pure learning of each characteristic point of view. For learning with vast amount of data, most of this interference is self-purified and has little impact on learning results. On the contrary, in the case of fine-tuning where learning is performed on a small amount of data, the impact of such interference on learning can be relatively large. To solve this problem, therefore, we propose a novel ‘Character-Independent Transfer-learning’ that performs transfer learning independently for each character.  In order to confirm the feasibility of the proposed methodology, we performed experiments utilizing the results of pre-training on MSCOCO dataset which is comprised of 120,000 images and about 600,000 general captions. Additionally, according to the advice of an art therapist, about 300 pairs of ‘image / expertise captions’ were created, and the data was used for the experiments of expertise transplantation. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the caption generated according to the proposed methodology generates captions from the perspective of implanted expertise whereas the caption generated thro"

Researchers’ interests in deep learning techniques have explosively increased worldwide; however, it is not easy for them to link linguistics to deep learning techniques or algorithms because linguists do not know how and where to begin in using them. Thus, this study provides the general procedure to train data using deep learning algorithms in practice. In particular, for instance, we focused on how to preprocess and transform Tweet data for a sentiment analysis by using deep learning techniques. In addition, we introduced the latest deep learning algorithm, so-called BERT, in the data preprocessing and transformation procedure. The data preprocessing is particularly important because the result from deep learning can significantly vary depending on it. Even though the data preprocessing procedure can differ according to the aim of research, this study tries to introduce the general way that advanced researchers frequently use for deep learning algorithms. This study is expected to lower the barriers in applying deep learning techniques to linguistic data and make it easier for researchers to conduct deep learning research related to linguistics."

Artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance the value of IoT data (data collected by IoT devices). The internet of things (IoT) promotes the learning and intelligence capability of AI. To extract insights from massive volume IoT data in real-time using deep learning, processing capability needs to happen in the IoT end devices where data is generated. However, deep learning requires a significant number of computational resources that may not be available at the IoT end devices. Such problems have been addressed by transporting bulks of data from the IoT end devices to the cloud datacenters for processing. But transferring IoT big data to the cloud incurs prohibitively high transmission delay and privacy issues which are a major concern. Edge computing, where distributed computing nodes are placed close to the IoT end devices, is a viable solution to meet the high computation and low-latency requirements and to preserve the privacy of users. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of leveraging deep learning within edge computing to unleash the potential of IoT big data generated from IoT end devices. We believe that the revision will have a contribution to the development of DNA-based intelligent services and applications. It describes the different distributed training and inference architectures of deep learning models across multiple nodes of the edge computing platform. It also provides the different privacy-preserving approaches of deep learning on the edge computing environment and the various application domains where deep learning on the network edge can be useful.

A method of generating virtual shadow dataset of buildings for the shadow detection and removal,2020,"['Unity3D', 'Shadow Dataset', 'Deep Learning', 'Satellite shadow data', 'Building shadow data']",,"Detecting shadows in images and restoring or removing them was a very challenging task in computer vision. Traditional researches used color information, edges, and thresholds to detect shadows, but there were errors such as not considering the penumbra area of shadow or even detecting a black area that is not a shadow. Deep learning has been successful in various fields of computer vision, and research on applying deep learning has started in the field of shadow detection and removal. However, it was very difficult and time-consuming to collect data for network learning, and there were many limited conditions for shooting. In particular, it was more difficult to obtain shadow data from buildings and satellite images, which hindered the progress of the research. In this paper, we propose a method for generating shadow data from buildings and satellites using Unity3D. In the virtual Unity space, 3D objects existing in the real world were placed, and shadows were generated using lights effects to shoot. Through this, it is possible to get all three types of images (shadow-free, shadow image, shadow mask) necessary for shadow detection and removal when training deep learning networks. The method proposed in this paper contributes to helping the progress of the research by providing big data in the field of building or satellite shadow detection and removal research, which is difficult for learning deep learning networks due to the absence of data.

In particular, there is little data on fire detection in underground utility facilities, which have poor light conditions and many objects similar to fire. These make fire detection challenging and cause low performance of deep learning models. Therefore, this study proposed a fire detection model using deep learning and estimated the performance of the model. The proposed model was designed using a combination of a basic convolutional neural network, Inception block of GoogleNet, and Skip connection of ResNet to optimize the deep learning model for fire detection under underground utility facilities. In addition, a training technique for the model was proposed. To examine the effectiveness of the method, the trained model was applied to fire images, which included fire and non-fire (which can be misunderstood as a fire) objects under the underground facilities or similar conditions, and results were analyzed. Metrics, such as precision and recall from deep learning models of other studies, were compared with those of the proposed model to estimate the model performance qualitatively.

High turbidity during floods increases the operation cost of a drinking water supply system. Thus, the management of turbidity is essential for providing safe water to the public. There have been various efforts to estimate turbidity in river systems for proper management and early warning of high turbidity in the water supply process. Advanced data analysis technology using machine learning has been increasingly used in water quality management processes. Artificial neural networks(ANNs) is one of the first algorithms applied, where the overfitting of a model to observed data and vanishing gradient in the backpropagation process limit the wide application of ANNs in practice. In recent years, deep learning, which overcomes the limitations of ANNs, has been applied in water quality management. LSTM is one of novel deep learning algorithms that is widely used in the analysis of time series data.In this study, LSTM is used for the prediction of high turbidity(>30 NTU) in a river from the relationship of turbidity to discharge, which enables early warning of high turbidity in a drinking water supply system. The model showed 0.98, 0.99, 0.98 and 0.99 for precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy respectively, for the prediction of high turbidity in a river with 2 hour frequency data. The sensitivity of the model to the observation intervals of data is also compared with time periods of 2 hour, 8 hour, 1 day and 2 days. The model shows higher precision with shorter observation intervals, which underscores the importance of collecting high frequency data for better management of water resources in the future."

Recently, the field of natural language processing has been actively researched using pre-trained language representation models with a large amount of corpus. In particular, the named entity recognition, which is one of the fields of natural language processing, uses a supervised learning method, which requires a large amount of training dataset and computation. Reinforcement learning is a method that learns through trial and error experience without initial data and is closer to the process of human learning than other machine learning methodologies and is not much applied to the field of natural language processing yet. It is often used in simulation environments such as Atari games and AlphaGo. BERT is a general-purpose language model developed by Google that is pre-trained on large corpus and computational quantities. Recently, it is a language model that shows high performance in the field of natural language processing research and shows high accuracy in many downstream tasks of natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a new named entity recognition DeNERT model using two deep learning models, DQN and BERT. The proposed model is trained by creating a learning environment of reinforcement learning model based on language expression which is the advantage of the general language model. The DeNERT model trained in this way is a faster inference time and higher performance model with a small amount of training dataset. Also, we validate the performance of our model’s named entity recognition performance through experiments."

However, it is difficult to obtain sufficient labeled PCB data to train deep neural networks. Additionally, although deep neural networks are trained by labeled data from a PCB inspection process (source domain), it is difficult to apply the trained networks to other PCB inspection processes (target domain).

To solve the task of generating sentences from triples using a deep neural network, learning data consisting of many pairs of triples and natural language sentences are required. However, it is difficult to learn the model because the learning data composed in Korean is not yet released. To solve the deficiency of learning data, this paper proposes an unsupervised learning method that extracts keywords based on Korean Wikipedia sentence data and generates learning data using a noise injection technique. To evaluate the proposed method, we used gold-standard dataset produced by triples and sentence pairs. Consequently, the proposed noise injection method showed superior performances over normal unsupervised learning on various evaluation metrics including automatic and human evaluations."

Because it is evaluated based on the subjective criteria of experts, and different results may be produced depending on the ability of the experts. In recent years, with the development of deep learning technologies, there is an expectation that identification will be possible through objective automatic tooth classification and analysis that solves such problems using these technologies. However, there is a problem in that it is difficult to acquire a sufficient amount of data for deep learning because of the privacy of the real tooth image. In this paper, we propose a generation model of DCGANs (deep learning model deep convolutional generative adversarial networks)-based teeth image data for effective identification using a small amount of real tooth surface image. The performance of the study was analyzed using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), and the performance was relatively low because not all images were similar to the real teeth. However, among the generated images, there were images that were very similar to real teeth, so if they were selected, they could be used for deep learning techniques for automatic tooth classification and analysis."

DNN의 중간층을 증가하게 되면 예측률은 높아지나 인식률이 감소하는 현상이 발생하였다. 이것은 인식하고자 하는 대상이 적음으로써 발생하는 과적합으로 판단된다. 제안 모델은 명확한 얼굴 영상을 추가하여 학 습한 결과, 높은 예측률과 인식률의 결과를 얻을 수 있음을 확인할 수 있었다. 본 연구는 좀 더 많은 얼굴 영상 데이터를 이용함으로써 보다 효과적인 딥러닝 구축을 통해 보다 향상된 인식률과 예측률을 얻을 수 있을 것이다.","The proposed model implements a model that improves the face prediction rate and recognition rate through learning with an artificial neural network using face detection, landmark and face recognition algorithms. After landmarking in the face images of a specific person, the proposed model use the previously learned Caffe model to extract face detection and embedding vector 128D. The learning is learned by building machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural network (DNN). Face recognition is tested with a face image different from the learned figure using the learned model. As a result of the experiment, the result of learning with DNN rather than SVM showed better prediction rate and recognition rate. However, when the hidden layer of DNN is increased, the prediction rate increases but the recognition rate decreases. This is judged as overfitting caused by a small number of objects to be recognized. As a result of learning by adding a clear face image to the proposed model, it is confirmed that the result of high prediction rate and recognition rate can be obtained. This research will be able to obtain better recognition and prediction rates through effective deep learning establishment by utilizing more face image data."

However, the YOLO utilizes the conventional DCNN (deep convolutional neural network) algorithm to extract features from images thus, detection performance of the YOLO depends on the DCNN utilized. Therefore, we evaluate the object detection performance by changing the feature extraction layers of YOLOv2 with AlexNet, VGG19, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50 to find the best combination DCNN model for YOLO on the six bees above. The comparison results are as follows. In terms of the speed of detection and classification, the model in which YOLOv2 is combined with the AlexNet as a feature extraction layer showed the highest detection speed per second. This model can detect and classify 5 vespas and a bee from an average of 438 images per second, but has a relatively low accuracy of 71.7%. In terms of accuracy, the model that combines the feature extraction layer of VGG19 with YOLOv2 generated the highest accuracy, 83.2%. In addition, it can process an average of 135 images per second, enabling real-time processing of surveillance videos for wasps and bees.

이상치 데이터를 고려한 DT-CNN 기반의 전동기 고장 예측,2020,"['Deep learning', 'Open-set recognition', 'DT-CNN', 'Motor fault prediction', 'Machine learning theory']",,"One of the major problems with the existing motor failure prediction system is to assume that all motors with the same fault condition have the same or a similar signal. This is a problem that arises because it is impossible to measure all the countless types of motors and data of driving conditions and failures. It is difficult to implement a general-purpose failure prediction system with an existing system having limited data and limited output. Data that have a large difference because they do not exist in the existing system are called outlier data. In previous studies, the problem arising from the outlier data has not been considered. To solve this problem, a system designed by separating the failure diagnosis model and the failure prediction model is proposed. The diagnostic model of the proposed system can detect data that are not inside big data using a decision-tree convolution neural network (DT-CNN). By using the diagnostic model and the predictive model in series, it is possible to analyze data in a non-measured state more efficiently. Additionally, a method for averaging the outputs of the diagnostic and predictive models is proposed. Through this, the deep learning algorithm can obtain in effect of applying the filter. Furthermore, the average values can be used to confirm the long-term signal change trend. The proposed system improves the problems of the existing failure prediction and enables more practical failure prediction."

Therefore, minutiae tend to be used with skeleton images.

The market size of immersive 360-degree video contents worldwide is projected to increase from $6.7 billion in 2018 to approximately $70 billion in 2020. However, most of the immersive 360-degree video contents are distributed through illegal distribution networks such as Webhard and Torrent, and the damage caused by illegal reproduction is increasing. Existing 2D video industry uses copyright filtering technology to prevent such illegal distribution. The technical difficulties dealing with immersive 360-degree videos arise in that they require ultra-high quality pictures and have the characteristics containing images captured by two or more cameras merged in one image, which results in the creation of distortion regions. There are also technical limitations such as an increase in the amount of feature point data due to the ultra-high definition and the processing speed requirement. These consideration makes it difficult to use the same 2D filtering technology for 360-degree videos. To solve this problem, this paper suggests a feature point extraction and identification technique that select object identification areas excluding regions with severe distortion, recognize objects using deep learning technology in the identification areas, extract feature points using the identified object information. Compared with the previously proposed method of extracting feature points using stitching area for immersive contents, the proposed technique shows excellent performance gain."
고정밀 이미지 분류기를 위한 엣지 강화 신경망,2020,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Edge enhancement', 'Feature map', 'Image classification', 'Neural network', 'Supervised learning']",,"Among the several deep learning research areas, image classification is a fundamental area and has been widely applied to many practical applications. Image classification is to determine which category the given image belongs to. Since the image classification is a typical supervised learning, test images and the corresponding answers, i.e., labels are also given. And, with the given test images and labels, a neural network is trained to minimize a loss function defined by error between the label and the inference result. Therefore, as the loss decreases, the inference accuracy increases. As a result, the accuracy is a criteria of the performance of the neural network in image classification. In this paper, a new method for high accuracy image classification is suggested. Authors thinks that recognizing things mean seeing the shape of the things. With the intuition, in the proposed method, additional edge information is applied to the image and around 3% accuracy improvement is achieved in the experiment. In order to clarify the improvement, compared feature maps in the hidden layers are visualized and analyzed. And, it is also confirmed that the feature map of the proposed method is more clear and sharp than that of the conventional one. Another merit of the proposed method is that this method can easily improve the accuracy of the conventionally existing neural networks through the transfer learning because the proposed method just modifies the first layer of the conventional neural networks."

Particularly, in the case of a light source object, it is difficult to use the features of the daytime as it is due to light smudging and whitening.

Change detection methods using high-resolution satellite images can be used to resolve various urban problems such as city planning and forecasting. For using pixel-based change detection, which is a conventional method such as Iteratively Reweighted-Multivariate Alteration Detection (IRMAD), unchanged areas will be detected as changing areas because changes in pixels are sensitive to the state of the environment such as seasonal changes between images. Therefore, in this paper, to precisely detect the changes of the objects that consist of the city in time-series satellite images, the semantic spatial objects that consist of the city are defined, extracted through deep learning based image segmentation, and then analyzed the changes between areas to carry out change detection. The semantic objects for analyzing changes were defined as six classes: building, road, farmland, vinyl house, forest area, and waterside area. Each network model learned with KOMPSAT-3A satellite images performs a change detection for the time-series KOMPSAT-3 satellite images.

In addition, because the number of datasets available in deep learning, whose contents are image pairs of hazy and corresponding haze-free (ground truth) indoor images, is quite limited, the haze removal performance may be reduced. To solve this problem, in this paper, a selective dehazing system is proposed that combines a haze detection network and a dehazing network. The proposed haze detection network is designed using a CNN structure to determine the haze density of the input image, and the use of the dehazing network is determined. The proposed dehazing network uses the U-Net model to efficiently learn only a limited number of datasets. To evaluate the performance of the proposed network, only 45 O-Hazes were used.

In general, when learning a neural network, some of the data are not helpful for learning, but rather disturbing. Those are called outlier data. When they are included in the training data, various problems such as overfitting occur. In building a PM2.5 fine dust concentration forecasting system using neural network, we have found several outlier data in the training data. We, therefore, remove them, and then make learning 3 ways. Over_outlier model removes outlier data that target concentration is low, but the model forecast is high. Under_outlier model removes outliers data that target concentration is high, but the model forecast is low. All_outlier model removes both Over_outlier and Under_outlier data.

Document Image Binarization by GAN with Unpaired Data Training,2020,"['document image binarization', 'unpaired training data', 'gan', 'unsupervised learning']",,"Data is critical in deep learning but the scarcity of data often occurs in research, especially in the preparation of the paired training data. In this paper, document image binarization with unpaired data is studied by introducing adversarial learning, excluding the need for supervised or labeled datasets. However, the simple extension of the previous unpaired training to binarization inevitably leads to poor performance compared to paired data training. Thus, a new deep learning approach is proposed by introducing a multidiversity of higher quality generated images. In this paper, a two-stage model is proposed that comprises the generative adversarial network (GAN) followed by the U-net network. In the first stage, the GAN uses the unpaired image data to create paired image data. With the second stage, the generated paired image data are passed through the U-net network for binarization. Thus, the trained U-net becomes the binarization model during the testing. The proposed model has been evaluated over the publicly available DIBCO dataset and it outperforms other techniques on unpaired training data. The paper shows the potential of using unpaired data for binarization, for the first time in the literature, which can be further improved to replace paired data training for binarization in the future."

In addition,the model is influenced by its inherent uncertainty in describing a system’s behavior of interest.

Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) is a useful tool todescribe stochastic characteristics of deep learning models by estimating distributions of the models’ weights. Model uncertainty in BNN canbe classified into epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Epistemic uncertainty is caused by lack of data or knowledge. In contrast, aleatoricuncertainty is caused by outliers or noises inherent in training data and can be reduced by removing abnormal data from the training dataset.In this study, the BNN models were developed for a compression chiller in an existing office building with BEMS data, and then epistemicand aleatoric uncertainties were analyzed. It is found that both uncertainties are significant in the simulation model even though the model’saccuracy is satisfactory with the CVRMSE of less than 15%. It is suggested that before attempting to apply the machine learning model toreal applications, the both uncertainties must be carefully analyzed.

Towards bearing failure prognostics: a practical comparison between datadriven methods for industrial applications,2020,['· Bearing failure prognostics · Deep belief networks · Gaussian process regression · Health indicator construction · Monotonicity'],,"Research studies on data-driven approaches to rotating components and rolling element bearing (REB) prognostics have recently witnessed a rapid increase. These datadriven methods rely on sensor data for condition monitoring and degradation assessments;however, the problem of mining features from these sophisticated data using appropriate intelligent methods and choosing a practically reliable predictive model(s) has become a global concern. Vibration monitoring for REBs have over the years shown great effectiveness.Although monotonic statistical features serve as reliable health indicators (HIs), relying on a single feature for optimal bearing degradation assessment is inefficient. By fusing highly monotonic features using appropriate methods, a more reliable HI can be constructed and from this, various degradation states/stages and time to start prediction (TSP) can be identified by mapping known failure modes/degradation states to cluster points from clustering algorithms.Emphatically, the choice of regression algorithms for prognostics poses more concern as engineers and data scientists are faced with choosing between Bayessian machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods.

In this paper, we are going to use the convolutional denoising autoencoder (CDAE) model of deep learning to eliminate noise. The CDAE model is a combination of the CNN (convolutional neural network) model and the DAE (denoising autoencoder) model, which is an applicable method regardless of the noise distribution of images.

It is challenging to detect these malicious apps using traditional malware detection techniques due to intelligence of today’s attack mechanisms. Deep learning (DL) is an alternative technique of traditional signature and rule-based anomaly detection techniques and thus have actively been used in numerous recent studies on malware detection. In order to develop DL-based defense mechanisms against intelligent malicious apps, feeding recent datasets into DL models is important. In this paper, we develop a DL-based model for detecting intelligent malicious apps using KU-CISC 2018-Android, the most up-to-date dataset consisting of benign and malicious Android apps. This dataset has hardly been addressed in other studies so far. We extract OPcode sequences from the Android apps and preprocess the OPcode sequences using an N-gram model. We then feed the preprocessed data into LSTM and apply the concept of Information Gain to improve performance of detecting malicious apps. Furthermore, we evaluate our model with numerous scenarios in order to verify the model’s design and performance."

The original martensite structures and prior austenite grain boundaries were prepared using different chemical etching solutions.

Analyzing nuclear reactor simulation data and uncertainty with the group method of data handling,2020,"['Uncertainty quantification', 'GMDH', 'Surrogate modeling', 'Deep learning', 'Reactor simulations']",,"Group method of data handling (GMDH) is considered one of the earliest deep learning methods. Deep learning gained additional interest in today's applications due to its capability to handle complex and high dimensional problems. In this study, multi-layer GMDH networks are used to perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity analysis (SA) of nuclear reactor simulations. GMDH is utilized as a surrogate/metamodel to replace high fidelity computer models with cheap-to-evaluate surrogate models, which facilitate UQ and SA tasks (e.g. variance decomposition, uncertainty propagation, etc.). GMDH performance is validated through two UQ applications in reactor simulations: (1) low dimensional input space (two-phase flow in a reactor channel), and (2) high dimensional space (8-group homogenized cross-sections). In both applications, GMDH networks show very good performance with small mean absolute and squared errors as well as high accuracy in capturing the target variance. GMDH is utilized afterward to perform UQ tasks such as variance decomposition through Sobol indices, and GMDH-based uncertainty propagation with large number of samples. GMDH performance is also compared to other surrogates including Gaussian processes and polynomial chaos expansions. The comparison shows that GMDH has competitive performance with the other methods for the low dimensional problem, and reliable performance for the high dimensional problem."

The Study on Implementation of Crime Terms Classification System for Crime Issues Response,2020,"['Multi-Layer Perceptron', 'Crime', 'Machine Learning', 'Classification', 'NLP']",,"The fear of crime, discussed in the early 1960s in the United States, is a psychological response, such as anxiety or concern about crime, the potential victim of a crime. These anxiety factors lead to the burden of the individual in securing the psychological stability and indirect costs of the crime against the society. Fear of crime is not a good thing, and it is a part that needs to be adjusted so that it cannot be exaggerated and distorted by the policy together with the crime coping and resolution. This is because fear of crime has as much harm as damage caused by criminal act. Eric Pawson has argued that the popular impression of violent crime is not formed because of media reports, but by official statistics. Therefore, the police should watch and analyze news related to fear of crime to reduce the social cost of fear of crime and prepare a preemptive response policy before the people have 'fear of crime'. In this paper, we propose a deep - based news classification system that helps police cope with crimes related to crimes reported in the media efficiently and quickly and precisely. The goal is to establish a system that can quickly identify changes in security issues that are rapidly increasing by categorizing news related to crime among news articles. To construct the system, crime data was learned so that news could be classified according to the type of crime. Deep learning was applied by using Google tensor flow. In the future, it is necessary to continue research on the importance of keyword according to early detection of issues that are rapidly increasing by crime type and the power of the press, and it is also necessary to constantly supplement crime related corpus."

A deep structured GRU was used in the proposed method, which is a common recurrent neural network. The proposed deep learning (SleepGRU) model consists of a 5-layer GRU and is optimized by batch-normalization, dropout, and Adam update rules. The ECG signal was recorded during nocturnal polysomnography from 112 subjects, and was normalized and segmented into units of 30-second duration. To train and evaluate the proposed method, the training set consisted of 80,316 segments from 89 subjects, and the test set used 20,079 segments from 23 subjects.

Fall Detection Based on Human Skeleton Keypoints Using GRU,2020,"['Skeleton Key points', 'GRU', 'Fall Detection', 'Deep Learning', 'PoseNet']",,"A recent study to determine the fall is focused on analyzing fall motions using a recurrent neural network (RNN), and uses a deep learning approach to get good results for detecting human poses in 2D from a mono color image. In this paper, we investigated the improved detection method to estimate the position of the head and shoulder key points and the acceleration of position change using the skeletal key points information extracted using PoseNet from the image obtained from the 2D RGB low-cost camera, and to increase the accuracy of the fall judgment. In particular, we propose a fall detection method based on the characteristics of post-fall posture in the fall motion analysis method and on the velocity of human body skeleton key points change as well as the ratio change of body bounding box's width and height. The public data set was used to extract human skeletal features and to train deep learning, GRU, and as a result of an experiment to find a feature extraction method that can achieve high classification accuracy, the proposed method showed a 99.8% success rate in detecting falls more effectively than the conventional primitive skeletal data use method."

Exploring Generalization Capacity of Artificial Neural Network for Myelin Water Imaging,2020,"['Artificial neural network', 'Myelin water imaging', 'T2 relaxation', 'Deep learning', 'Generalization capacity']",,"Purpose: To understand the effects of datasets with various parameters on pretrained network performance, the generalization capacity of the artificial neural network for myelin water imaging (ANN-MWI) is explored by testing datasets with various scan protocols (i.e., resolution and refocusing RF pulse shape) and types of disorders (i.e., neuromyelitis optica and edema).Materials and Methods: ANN-MWI was trained to generate a T2 distribution, from which the myelin water fraction value was measured. The training and test datasets were acquired from healthy controls and multiple sclerosis patients using a multiecho gradient and spin-echo sequence with the same scan protocols. To test the generalization capacity of ANN-MWI, datasets with different settings were utilized.The datasets were acquired or generated with different resolutions, refocusing pulse shape, and types of disorders. For all datasets, the evaluation was performed in a white matter mask by calculating the normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) between the results from the conventional method and ANN-MWI. Additionally, for the patient datasets, the NRMSE was calculated in each lesion mask.Results: The results of ANN-MWI showed high reliability in generating myelin water fraction maps from the datasets with different resolutions. However, the increased errors were reported for the datasets with different refocusing pulse shapes and disorder types. Specifically, the region of lesions in edema patients reported high NRMSEs. These increased errors indicate the dependency of ANN-MWI on refocusing pulse flip angles and T2 characteristics.Conclusion: This study proposes information about the generalization accuracy of a trained network when applying deep learning to processing myelin water imaging."

Age Estimation via Selecting Discriminated Features and Preserving Geometry,2020,"['Age Estimation', 'Least Square Regression', 'Cumulative Attribute Coding', 'Feature Selection', 'Manifold Learning']",,"Human apparent age estimation has become a popular research topic and attracted great attention in recent years due to its wide applications, such as personal security and law enforcement. To achieve the goal of age estimation, a large number of methods have been pro-posed, where the models derived through the cumulative attribute coding achieve promised performance by preserving the neighbor-similarity of ages. However, these methods afore-mentioned ignore the geometric structure of extracted facial features. Indeed, the geometric structure of data greatly affects the accuracy of prediction. To this end, we propose an age estimation algorithm through joint feature selection and manifold learning paradigms, so-called Feature-selected and Geometry-preserved Least Square Regression (FGLSR). Based on this, our proposed method, compared with the others, not only preserves the geometry structures within facial representations, but also selects the discriminative features. Moreover, a deep learning extension based FGLSR is proposed later, namely Feature selected and Geometry preserved Neural Network (FGNN). Finally, related experiments are conducted on Morph2 and FG-Net datasets for FGLSR and on Morph2 datasets for FGNN. Experimental results testify our method achieve the best performances."

Jang Ilsoon presents the ecological world view in an attempt to solve the underlying problem based on existential reflection. This is one, but all in all, one world view of holism, the world view of spirituality. This is similar to the deep ecology of the West.

In particular, with the growth of cloud computing, the proportional expansion of the data center infrastructure is inevitable. Monitoring the health of these data center facilities is a way to maintain and manage the system and prevent failure. If a failure occurs in some elements of the facility, it may affect not only the relevant equipment but also other connected equipment, and may cause enormous damage. In particular, IT facilities are irregular due to interdependence and it is difficult to know the cause.  In the previous study predicting failure in data center, failure was predicted by looking at a single server as a single state without assuming that the devices were mixed. Therefore, in this study, data center failures were classified into failures occurring inside the server (Outage A) and failures occurring outside the server (Outage B), and focused on analyzing complex failures occurring within the server. Server external failures include power, cooling, user errors, etc. Since such failures can be prevented in the early stages of data center facility construction, various solutions are being developed. On the other hand, the cause of the failure occurring in the server is difficult to determine, and adequate prevention has not yet been achieved. In particular, this is the reason why server failures do not occur singularly, cause other server failures, or receive something that causes failures from other servers. In other words, while the existing studies assumed that it was a single server that did not affect the servers and analyzed the failure, in this study, the failure occurred on the assumption that it had an effect between servers.  In order to define the complex failure situation in the data center, failure history data for each equipment existing in the data center was used. There are four major failures considered in this study: Network Node Down, Server Down, Windows Activation Services Down, and Database Management System Service Down. The failures that occur for each device are sorted in chronological order, and when a failure occurs in a specific equipment, if a failure occurs in a specific equipment within 5 minutes from the time of occurrence, it is defined that the failure occurs simultaneously. After configuring the sequence for the devices that have failed at the same time, 5 devices that frequently occur simultaneously within the configured sequence were selected, and the case where the selected devices failed at the same time was confirmed through visualization.  Since the server resource information collected for failure analysis is in units of time series and has flow, we used Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), a deep learning algorithm that can predict the next state through the previous state. In addition, unlike a single server, the Hierarchical Attention Network deep learning model structure was used in consideration of the fact that the level of multiple failures for each server is different. This algorithm is a method of increasing the prediction accuracy by giving weight to the server as the impact on the failure increases. The study began with defining the type of failure and selecting the analysis target. In the first experiment, the same collected data was assumed as a single server state and a multiple server state, and compared and analyzed. The second experiment improved the prediction accuracy in the case of a complex server by optimizing each server threshold.  In the first experiment, which assumed each of a single server and multiple servers, in the case of a single server, it was predicted that three of the five servers did not have a failure even though the actual failure occurred. However, assuming multiple servers"

The oral history education can be used for a variety of methods and purposes.Oral history education helps to promote historical thinking by using a unique kind of historical evidence, oral sources. Through oral history, students can discover new information, counter narratives or different interpretations, and specific and practical exploratory questions that are not contained in written sources. However, placing the focus of oral education on enhancing historical thinking ability would limit the various possibilities of oral education.Students can also historicize the lives of social minorities or the oppressed who are in the community, through oral history education. It is very useful for students, in terms of communication, consideration, mitigation of potential conflict and violence, to make their daily lives a historical story based on the values of peace and human rights. In this process, students should be able to understand and practice concepts such as deep listening and chain of testimony.Family history is a material that can satisfy the interests of individual students with various social and cultural environments. Through project activities that collect and organize the family's private history with oral language, students can find new meaning for official historical events handled in school or link the school history to the family's memories. These activities can encourage the natural and active participation of the students’ families, including parents, in the school's educational activities. At this time, the memory of the family becomes the source of the learning, and the result of the learning is the product of the joint work of the teacher󰠏student󰠏family, the main agents of education. These activities can also facilitate mutual understanding among family and foster the harmony of the family. Sometimes, the hard experiences of the family member who was a victim of a historical event are shared ‘first time’ through interviews.Finally, through interviews and analysis of oral materials, students can understand the structural characteristics of the current historical debates. The goal of these activities is to identify that historical debates are conflicts that define the identity of individuals and society, and to form a independent perception of them in a rational and productive way."

To make sure the safety of road traffic, a learning model of estimating visibility distance should be developed, which shows the actual visibility level to the vehicle drivers during foggy weather. In this paper, we have proposed a clustering learning model that provides the visibility level to the drivers in real-time. We use the real CCTV camera images on the roadside and extract a data pattern from it, and then we classify that pattern into different visibility levels by using hierarchical clustering. First, for pattern extraction, we select the optimal regions of interest (ROI) in a CCTV image and then extract features from each ROI. The features we extract are the ""number of lines"" and the ""number of contours"" detected in each ROI. Finally, we use hierarchical clustering to classify that data-pattern into different visibility levels. We have implemented hierarchical clustering using two similarity distance metrics, dynamic time warping (DTW) as our main similarity distance metric, and Minkowski is supplementary for comparison purposes. In this paper, we provide a relative visibility estimation method, which is independent of using threshold and performs well in diverse conditions. We have compared our approach to a deep learning method, and it has an overall accuracy of around 90%."
LSTM 모형을 이용한 지하수위 예측 평가,2020,[],,"Quantitative forecasting of groundwater levels for the assessment of groundwater variation and vulnerability is very important. To achieve this purpose, various time series analysis and machine learning techniques have been used. In this study, we developed a prediction model based on LSTM (Long short term memory), one of the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms, for predicting the daily groundwater level of 11 groundwater wells in Hankyung-myeon, Jeju Island. In general, the groundwater level in Jeju Island is highly autocorrelated with tides and reflected the effects of precipitation. In order to construct an input and output variables based on the characteristics of addressing data, the precipitation data of the corresponding period was added to the groundwater level data. The LSTM neural network was trained using the initial 365-day data showing the four seasons and the remaining data were used for verification to evaluate the fitness of the predictive model. The model was developed using Keras, a Python-based deep learning framework, and the NVIDIA CUDA architecture was implemented to enhance the learning speed. As a result of learning and verifying the groundwater level variation using the LSTM neural network, the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) was 0.98 on average, indicating that the predictive model developed was very accurate."

We analyze how each of these activity affects the type of innovation and the performance of firms through causal relationship pathways. According to the findings of parallel and serial multiple mediation analyses of 612 innovative manufacturers extracted from the 2014 Korea Business Innovation Survey, the diversity of external knowledge search behaviors has a sequential effect on the release of innovative products and improvement of performance through investment in market knowledge, rather than R&D investment internally. On the other hand, in-depth external knowledge search activities have been shown to promote both R&D investment and investment in market knowledge, enhancing both radical and incremental innovation and contributing sequentially to performance improvement. There was not a statistically significant differences in the magnitude of the mediating effects. The findings provide academic implication in (1) that the scope of knowledge acquired by a firm from outside is expanded to market knowledge, (2) that the internal and external learning processes to acquire, internalize and utilize them are defined separately, and (3) that they presented an open innovation process model based on a comprehensive external knowledge exploration based on their relationships.

The system captures gasometer image using mobile device camera, transmits the image to a cloud server on top of private LTE network, and analyzes the image to extract character information of device ID and gas usage amount by selective optical character recognition based on deep learning technology. In general, there are many types of character in an image and optical character recognition technology extracts all character information in an image. But some applications need to ignore non-of-interest types of character and only have to focus on some specific types of characters. For an example of the application, automatic gasometer reading system only need to extract device ID and gas usage amount character information from gasometer images to send bill to users. Non-of-interest character strings, such as device type, manufacturer, manufacturing date, specification and etc., are not valuable information to the application. Thus, the application have to analyze point of interest region and specific types of characters to extract valuable information only. We adopted CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based object detection and CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) technology for selective optical character recognition which only analyze point of interest region for selective character information extraction. We build up 3 neural networks for the application system. The first is a convolutional neural network which detects point of interest region of gas usage amount and device ID information character strings, the second is another convolutional neural network which transforms spatial information of point of interest region to spatial sequential feature vectors, and the third is bi-directional long short term memory network which converts spatial sequential information to character strings using time-series analysis mapping from feature vectors to character strings. In this research, point of interest character strings are device ID and gas usage amount. Device ID consists of 12 arabic character strings and gas usage amount consists of 4 ~ 5 arabic character strings. All system components are implemented in Amazon Web Service Cloud with Intel Zeon E5-2686 v4 CPU and NVidia TESLA V100 GPU. The system architecture adopts master-lave processing structure for efficient and fast parallel processing coping with about 700,000 requests per day. Mobile device captures gasometer image and transmits to master process in AWS cloud. Master process runs on Intel Zeon CPU and pushes reading request from mobile device to an input queue with FIFO (First In First Out) structure. Slave process consists of 3 types of deep neural networks which conduct character recognition process and runs on NVidia GPU module. Slave process is always polling the input queue to get recognition request. If there are some requests from master process in the input queue, slave process converts the image in the input queue to device ID character string, gas usage amount character string and position information of the strings, returns the information to output queue, and switch to idle mode to poll the input queue. Master process gets final information form the output queue and delivers the information to the mobile device. We used total 27,120 gasometer images for training, validation and testing of 3 types of deep neural network. 22,985 images were used for training and validation, 4,135 images were used for testing. We randomly splitted 22,985 images with 8:2 ratio for training and validation respectively for each training epoch. 4,135 test image were categorized into 5 types (Normal, noise, reflex, scale and slant). Normal data is clean image data, noise means image with noise signal, relfex means image with light reflection in gasometer region, scale means images with small object size due to long-distance capturin"

Especially in August, when he was 49 years old, the whole-day debate on Tongcheonam(通天巖) became the most groundbreaking occasion in academic and teaching methods.   In his 30s, Wang actively learned how to cure Taoism’s curing because of back pain and lung disease. He cured the disease to a certain extent by carrying out a positive study of Taoist life preserving arts, referring to the popular books “Hwang Jeong-gyeong(黃庭經)” and “Sujin-do(修眞圖).” When he was 35 years old, he had the mysterious experience of seeing the metaphysical noumenon of the mind(先天翁) for the first time in prison, and at the age of 37, he experienced the metaphysical change of noumenon and function(體用神化) in Yongjang(龍場) based on Shao Yuong(邵雍) moving method of vital essence by small circle(小周天). Based on his own experiences, he taught students the meditation method in sitting quietly and the sincerity meditation method(誠意工夫) at the age of 39. He changed the teaching method to the awakening of good nature(立志工夫) at the age of 43. His new meditation method was popular among students at the time, and was particularly popular with Wang Gi(王畿) and An Gyun(顔鈞).  While teaching in Gamju(贛州) and Namchang(南昌), the 48-year-old Wang faced a problem of unifying the study of sincerity(致知) in “Taxie(大學)” and the care of self(愼獨) in “Jungyong(中庸).” In August, student Jinguchun(陳九川) on the basis of the true mind of Lu Xiang Shan(陸象山) came to raise the issue of the awakening of good nature(致知) and the recognition of Lingming(靈明), Wang presented Yangji(良知) for the first time, and taught in Namchang, but the students did not pay much attention. However, in the summer of the 49-year-old, students had a full-day discussion with students in Tongcheonam(通天巖) about the unification of awakening of good nature(致知) and the care of self(愼獨), and the students were also convinced of Yangji(良知).  After returning to Shaoxing city(紹興府) at the age of 50, Wang taught Yangji for students who came to his house, and at the age of 54, said Yangji is an outstanding invention that transcended Yukguyeon(陸象山)’s psychology. In other words, he found the main dominator of the deep mind(the self-authentication, 自證分) in deep meditation. Wang continued to explain Yangji in his 50s. Yangji is the main dominator of the deep mind and includes heavenly principles. In 55-year-old, Wang comprehensively explained it is the clean and bright spirituality that has the cognitive and judgment abilities in mind according to the true and false two minds(眞妄二心) of buddhist epistemology.  As shown in the case of Gu Yang-deok(歐陽德)’s trap of deep meditation(禪病) Wang emphasized that Yangji has the ability to relieve the trap of deep meditation and can arrive at the highest stage of sage that Jeong Myeong-do(程明道) had imagined. He evaluated his own meditation method of Yangji is the best in Neo-Confucianism."
A feature fusion-based prognostics approach for rolling element bearings,2020,['· Long short-term memory · Kernel principal component analysis · Bearing degradation assessment · Feature fusion · Remaining useful life · KPCA-DLSTM'],,"The emergence of prognostics and health management as a condition-based maintenance approach has greatly improved productivity, maintainability, and most essentially, reliability of systems. Invariably, a rolling-element bearing (REB) is the heart of rotating components; however, its failure can have daunting effects ranging from costly unexpected breakdown to catastrophic life-threatening situations. Consequently, the need for accurate condition monitoring and prognostics of REBs cannot be overemphasized. In view of achieving a more comprehensive condition assessment for prognostics of REBs, this study proposes a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) feature fusion technique for degradation assessment and a deep learning model for prognostics. The deep learning method-deep long short-term memory (DLSTM) has shown an evident comparative advantage over the basic LSTM model and standard recurrent neural networks for time-series forecasting. Subsequently, the proposed prognostics model- KPCA-DLSTM performance was validated with a run-to-failure experiment on REBs and evaluated for accuracy against other prognostics methods reported in other works of literature using standard performance metrics. The proposed method was also used for REB remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and the results show that the KPCA-DLSTM does not only reflect a more monotonic bearing degradation trend but also yields better prognostics results."
CRLB Analysis for a Robust TRN Based on a Combination of RNN and PF,2020,['Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) · Terrain-referenced navigation (TRN) · Recurrent neural network (RNN) · Particle filter (PF) · Measurement noise covariance'],,"Terrain-referenced navigation (TRN) is a technology that estimates the position of an aircraft by comparing the terrain elevation on a digital elevation model (DEM) and the altitude measured by an altimeter. The particle filter (PF)-based TRN has been widely used for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating at a high altitude. Even though TRN performs well in rough and unique terrains, its performance degrades on flat and repetitive terrain. For this study, a robust PF-based TRN was designed, which uses a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based deep learning method to function on flat and repetitive terrains. Noise covariances and the measurement model of the PF were also trained. An RNN is an artificial neural network that recognizes patterns from a time-series. Due to the difficulty in theoretically verifying that the model generated by the deep learning method was designed optimally, we performed a Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis to evaluate how close the proposed method was to the optimal design. We also used a perturbation error model of an interferometric radar altimeter (IRA) as the measurement noise covariance needed for an accurate CRLB analysis."

Therefore, in this paper, the image label prediction algorithm based on CNN with collaborative layer with low complexity, high accuracy, and small amount of data was proposed. The proposed algorithm was designed to replace the part of the neural network that is performed to predict the final label in the existing deep learning algorithm by implementing collaborative filtering as a layer. It is expected that the proposed algorithm can contribute greatly to small and medium-sized content services that is unsuitable to apply the existing deep learning algorithm with high complexity and high server cost."

In addition, researches on end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition systems integrating language modeling and decoding processes have been actively conducted to better utilize the advantages of deep learning techniques. In general, E2E ASR systems consist of multiple layers of encoder-decoder structure with attention. Therefore, E2E ASR systems require data with a large amount of speech-text paired data in order to achieve good performance. Obtaining speech-text paired data requires a lot of human labor and time, and is a high barrier to building E2E ASR system. Therefore, there are previous studies that improve the performance of E2E ASR system using relatively small amount of speech-text paired data, but most studies have been conducted by using only speech-only data or text-only data. In this study, we proposed a semi-supervised training method that enables E2E ASR system to perform well in corpus in different domains by using both speech or text only data. The proposed method works effectively by adapting to different domains, showing good performance in the target domain and not degrading much in the source domain."

It is important to restore high-frequency components, such as texture and features, that have large changes in surrounding pixels during super-resolution processing. We proposed a super-resolution method using feature enhancement that combines Channel Attention and Spatial Attention. The existing CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based super-resolution method has difficulty in deep network learning and lacks emphasis on high frequency components, resulting in blurry contours and distortion. In order to solve the problem, we used an emphasis block that combines Channel Attention and Spatial Attention to which Skip Connection was applied, and a Residual Block.

Eunbong s learning is completed by practice. Not only did Eunbong not study for success, he also criticized the actions of those who commit injustice to lead successful lives. His philosophical perception of learning centers on morality that values self-discipline. The moral tradition he recognized is the root of human being of a righteous mind and right values. Among the historical figures, he respected and honored his teachers and wise men who valued patriotism and righteousness more than his own life. In his poem is the true heart of a scholar who values high sacrifice and reflects the value of human being. In addition to expressing lamentation, longing, and strong appeal, Eunbong expresses deep emotions that come from his own heart. Eunbong s poem induces emotional communication and spiritual communication. Eunbong s poetry is showing intimacy based on mutual trust, and his poetry is used as a means of emotional communication. Therefore, he was not stingy with the outpouring of emotion. The warm feeling expressed in his poems is empathy for other people s pain and suffering. It recognizes others as their own personality, and reflects his humanism. He is a serene recluse and ethical educator, illuminated by truth in his own mind. Eunbong s poems reflect on the deep meaning of quiet reclusive life. Eunbong s poetry can also look at the correlation between love for nature, reclusive life, and the academic spirit. For him, nature is meant as a hidden space. Nature is also meaningful as a space of contemplation for self-discipline and study. A quiet life with nature is the ultimate destination for a moral scholar."

The ‘walking together’ that Pope Francis promotes is, for him being another name for ‘synodos’, a symbolic sign of ‘synodality’/‘collegiality’ which are principles of eccesial governance in the ecclesiology of the Catholic Church. His conviction about the ‘synodality’ principle is, as far as theological thinking goes, grounded in the faithfulness to the ‘communio- ecclesialogy’ of Vatican Council Ⅱ that brought about a renewal of the Catholic Church in the modern times. However, this article wishes to argue that the reason why the Pope’s conviction is not only very deep and thorough going but also can be translated into actual acts of governance is due to the power of a practical motive that he came to possess through learning by experience throughout his life.  First, the article surveys the teachings and actual acts of governance by Pope Francis from his election up until the present time so as to ascertain the decisive importance of the ‘walking together’/‘synodality’ for his leadership style in governing the Church. Then, it ascertains through the Pope’s own remarks the connection between certain faults in his past Jesuit leadership and his exile at Córdoba. Furthermore, considering people’s estimations of Pope Francis as father Bergoglio, it shows that his inner problem, being in the final analysis the problem of exercising authority/power, was the other side of his inborn and strong leadership capacity, that is, the problem of self-assuarance and authoritarianism that resided deep in his personality and character. Then, the article turns to the task of elucidating the special significance of Bergoglio’s experience of exile at Córdoba to his ‘walking together’ leadership style. It, thus, elucidates from what exact discernment and conversion the principle of ‘walking together’ sprang, by considering a series of interrelated biographical episodes leading up to his exile at Córdoba, which took place after he had stepped down from major leadership positions of the Argentine Jesuit Province, and by reading discerningly his writings, especially his meditations written at Córdoba, as a source of autobiographical information.  In this way, the article contends that Bergoglio came to discern the leadership of ‘walking together’ and also to discover a path leading to a deep religious humility, through the humiliation of his exile at Córdoba and especially through deep meditations on the fact that his insistence on and prioritization of his own project, based on self-confidence, led to a division of community."

Is this confrontation in line with a significant transition in terms of academic history that cannot be neglected as a mere confrontation between academic schools? In this awareness of an issue, this study traces back changes in the process that Jeong In Hong defended Nammyeong and seeks to understand the fundamental cause of such changes. Additionally, this study examines how Jeong In Hong verified the orthodoxy of Nammyeong School by means of 「Jeong-maek- go-pung-byeon」 in the early 17th century when Neo-Confucianism (朱子學) was recognized with securing the orthodoxy of studies.Jeong In Hong refuted Twe-gye’s criticism against Nammyeong in terms of practice and fidelity to principles. He also criticized that Twe-gye requested to kill Bongsonggun (prince) Iwan and that there were gisaengs (Korean geisha) belonging to the governmental office. He questioned whose life of these two living in the same period of time was suitable for the times. He argued that a Confucian philosopher (道學) should not be judged based on whether or not he secures a governmental position but based on whether his works were appropriate for the times. In other words, Confucian philosophers should practice the ideas of moderation that passed down through Yo(堯)-Sun(舜)-Wu(禹).The key of Jeong In Hong's defense in favor of Nammyeong was spiritual awakening and moderation. However, Twe-gye sought to establish a rightful type of learning of Confucianism, thinking that this could be achieved through Neo-Confucianism. The academic position and influence of Twe-gye led this view and directivity into a significant transition in terms of academic history to the point that this mainstream could not be defied. As Jeong-gu stated that Twe-gye upheld traditional Confucianism while Nammyeong was a man of noble personality implies the academic idea of the times. Thus, the fact that Jeong In Hong defended Nammyeong in the perspective of practicing the idea of moderation was not a matter of logical justification. Rather, it resulted from the failure of gaining others’ consensus since he did not have deep understanding of changes in terms of academic history. On the other hand, it is not reasonable for a follower to abandon the life and academic identity pursued by his master depending on the current of the times. The solution that Jeong In Hong came up with was to publish Hak-gi-yu-pyeon (學記類編) and thus to clarify that Nammyeong’s learning was more deeply rooted in Jeongju School (程朱學). Certainly for the same purpose, scholars of Nammyeong School sought to make known the implications of Nammyeong’s learning on the basis of Jeongju School after Jeong In Hong.In today’s point of view, it would be hardly accepted that Neo-Confucianism is the only rightful learning (正學).

Accordingly, I redefine the goal of Korean literature education for advanced Korean language learners, and suggested a teaching plan.As the Korean literature education in the previous discussions didn’t consider literary nature analyzing content, goals, and methods of Korean literature education, the objective of the education were discussed without profound study on literary character. For this reason, an in-depth discussion of the goal of Korean literature education could not be conducted, and accordingly, the educational plan was not reflected in the literature.Being based on this critical review, and referring to the discussions of Kim In-hwan and Yoon Hye-jun, the goal of literary education is the encounter of the learner’s experience and literature, and the educator prepares literary knowledge for this and is sensitive and appropriate to learners’ and literature’s encounters. Educator needs to respond enthusiastically to help the students make their experiences encounter literature. Here, the literary knowledge constituting the literary characristic can be categorized into three demenscions of philology, hermeneutics, and rhetoric, and educator need to prepare for the knowledge foreign students need differently from Korean students depending on their cultural, social, and historical background, and Korean proficiency. In particular, this paper emphasized the need for educators to actively understand and learn the learner’s culture, history, and society.When presupposing the goal of Korean literature education, it was confirmed that sufficient consideration should be given to the literary nature in education, and the existing debate that literary works are difficult works was refuted. The literature that is rich in literary nature can be facilitated in education by inducing interest and empathy due to its literary nature manly hermeneutics and rhetoric. Besides, literature education for advanced Korean learners needs to be studied for adults, and education for modern literature rather than classics is required considering literary nature. Furthermore, it was shown that the Korean literature education, which is being conducted in Korean language education, needs to be distinguished by its limitations and progressed to the process of transitioning advanced learners to Korean literature education.I Go to Convenience Store shows that it is a work that can secure such literary and ease at the sametime, and examines the possibility and significance to realize the goal of Korean literature education suggesting a teaching example. In order to achieve the goal of appreciating literature in the course of I Go to Convenience Store I analyzed the appropriateness of the discourse-conversation-oriented teaching method, and as a reflective reconsideration of the existing discussion, emphathyzing learner ’ s voluntary and leading appreciation and expression of it. I Go to Convenience Store contains literary, philosophical and social insights about communication, lack, and capitalism, which may seem difficult. However, this is a philosophical and sociological premise of the modern society and the universal life of human beings now. The literary text that affects the entire process of deep thought and sensation as described above can enable the adult learners at the advanced level of Korean to think about the foundation problems of life. The results of this appreciation of Korean literature must include learning advanced Korean language.In this way, as a form of instruction that leads learners to appreciate literary works, the discourse-conversation-oriented teaching method is considered appropriate, and the teaching method of I Go to Convenience Store is presented as an example. The three main discourses to understand I Go to Convenience Store are summarized as absence of communication, lack, and alienation in a capitalist society. As a result, it was confirmed that “I go to a convenience store” is suitable as a textbook for Korean literature classes with ease, literary and presentness. In the class, the more students learn and lead literacy, the more advanced Korean learning can be achieved. In the process of appreciating literature aimed at I Go to Convenience Store learners feel and think literarily and philosophically about communication, lack, and capitalism. Language works not only at the stage of expression but also at the stage of thinking and sense.Lastly, I Go to Convenience Store is a textbook that can be achieved in a multi-layered way as well as high-level Korean language education. Korean education need to recognize that it could cover where their class cover the literary nature of the work. Through this, it was shown that literature can contribute to the possibility of communication and solidarity in the reality of labor and consumption that is excluded and alienated as a transnational aspect."
Spine Computed Tomography to Magnetic Resonance Image Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks : A Preliminary Study,2020,"['Deep learning', 'Lumbar vertebrae', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Computed tomography']",,"Objective : To generate synthetic spine magnetic resonance (MR) images from spine computed tomography (CT) using generative adversarial networks (GANs), as well as to determine the similarities between synthesized and real MR images. Methods : GANs were trained to transform spine CT image slices into spine magnetic resonance T2 weighted (MRT2) axial image slices by combining adversarial loss and voxel-wise loss. Experiments were performed using 280 pairs of lumbar spine CT scans and MRT2 images. The MRT2 images were then synthesized from 15 other spine CT scans. To evaluate whether the synthetic MR images were realistic, two radiologists, two spine surgeons, and two residents blindly classified the real and synthetic MRT2 images. Two experienced radiologists then evaluated the similarities between subdivisions of the real and synthetic MRT2 images. Quantitative analysis of the synthetic MRT2 images was performed using the mean absolute error (MAE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Results : The mean overall similarity of the synthetic MRT2 images evaluated by radiologists was 80.2%. In the blind classification of the real MRT2 images, the failure rate ranged from 0% to 40%. The MAE value of each image ranged from 13.75 to 34.24 pixels (mean, 21.19 pixels), and the PSNR of each image ranged from 61.96 to 68.16 dB (mean, 64.92 dB). Conclusion : This was the first study to apply GANs to synthesize spine MR images from CT images. Despite the small dataset of 280 pairs, the synthetic MR images were relatively well implemented. Synthesis of medical images using GANs is a new paradigm of artificial intelligence application in medical imaging. We expect that synthesis of MR images from spine CT images using GANs will improve the diagnostic usefulness of CT. To better inform the clinical applications of this technique, further studies are needed involving a large dataset, a variety of pathologies, and other MR sequence of the lumbar spine."
Combined spatial temporal based In-loop filter for scalable extension of HEVC,2020,['Scalable high efficiency video codingIn-loop filteringNeural networksPSNRTimeBit rate'],,"Deep learning plays a major role in the present video processing tools and algorithms. To​ alleviate the limitations of present in-loop filters in the scalable extension of HEVC (SHVC), a combined residual network (CResNet) in-loop filtering is proposed in this paper. The proposed CResNet in-loop filter exploits layer information available in the spatial temporal domain to restrain the visual artifacts like blocking and ringing. Particularly, the block information related to current and co-located blocks of the spatial and temporal base layer reference frames are considered to optimize the in-loop filtering. The proposed architecture has four convolution layers at the base layer and two convolution layers at the enhancement layer that significantly reduces the coding complexity and memory. Additionally to completely train the input content and also to enhance the in-loop filter performance, the on/off level control flag for coding tree Unit (CTU) is sensed using rate distortion optimization (RDO) approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides up to 6.2% to 7.2% reduction in bit rate and 1.01 dB improvement in PSNR compared to the standard SHVC codec."
Understanding recurrent neural network for texts using English-Korean corpora,2020,"['RNN', 'NLP', 'Seq2Seq', 'Neural Machine Translation', 'Keras']",,"Deep Learning is the most important key to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). There are several distinguishable architectures of neural networks such as MLP, CNN, and RNN. Among them, we try to understand one of the main architectures called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that differs from other networks in handling sequential data, including time series and texts. As one of the main tasks recently in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we consider Neural Machine Translation (NMT) using RNNs. We also summarize fundamental structures of the recurrent networks, and some topics of representing natural words to reasonable numeric vectors. We organize topics to understand estimation procedures from representing input source sequences to predict target translated sequences. In addition, we apply multiple translation models with Gated Recurrent Unites (GRUs) in Keras on English-Korean sentences that contain about 26,000 pairwise sequences in total from two different corpora, colloquialism and news. We verified some crucial factors that influence the quality of training. We found that loss decreases with more recurrent dimensions and using bidirectional RNN in the encoder when dealing with short sequences. We also computed BLEU scores which are the main measures of the translation performance, and compared them with the score from Google Translate using the same test sentences. We sum up some difficulties when training a proper translation model as well as dealing with Korean language. The use of Keras in Python for overall tasks from processing raw texts to evaluating the translation model also allows us to include some useful functions and vocabulary libraries as well."
Image classification and captioning model considering a CAM-based disagreement loss,2020,"['deep learning', 'image captioning', 'image classification']",,"Image captioning has received significant interest in recent years, and notable results have been achieved. Most previous approaches have focused on generating visual descriptions from images, whereas a few approaches have exploited visual descriptions for image classification. This study demonstrates that a good performance can be achieved for both description generation and image classification through an end-to-end joint learning approach with a loss function, which encourages each task to reach a consensus. When given images and visual descriptions, the proposed model learns a multimodal intermediate embedding, which can represent both the textual and visual characteristics of an object. The performance can be improved for both tasks by sharing the multimodal embedding. Through a novel loss function based on class activation mapping, which localizes the discriminative image region of a model, we achieve a higher score when the captioning and classification model reaches a consensus on the key parts of the object. Using the proposed model, we established a substantially improved performance for each task on the UCSD Birds and Oxford Flowers datasets."
Linear-Time Korean Morphological Analysis Using an Action-based Local Monotonic Attention Mechanism,2020,"['deep learning', 'korean morphological analysis', 'local attention mechanism', 'natural language processing', 'sequence-to-sequence learning']",,"For Korean language processing, morphological analysis is a critical component that requires extensive work. This morphological analysis can be conducted in an end-to-end manner without requiring a complicated feature design using a sequence-to-sequence model. However, the sequence-to-sequence model has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>) for an input length n when using the attention mechanism technique for high performance. In this study, we propose a linear-time Korean morphological analysis model using a local monotonic attention mechanism relying on monotonic alignment, which is a characteristic of Korean morphological analysis. The proposed model indicates an extreme improvement in a single threaded environment and a high morphometric F1-measure even for a hard attention model with the elimination of the attention mechanism formula."

A recent work proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based novelty detection model with significant performance improvements. We observed that it has a restriction of using document-level information in determining novelty but assumed that the document-level information is more important. As a solution, this paper proposed two methods of effectively incorporating document-level information using a CNN-based novelty detection model. Our methods focus on constructing a feature vector of a target document to be classified by extracting relative information between the target document and source documents given as evidence. A series of experiments showed the superiority of our methods on a standard benchmark collection, TAP-DLND 1.0."

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN(WGAN) is an alternative to GAN due to improved training stability. However, there are still cases where it generates poor samples or fails to converge. It is widely accepted that this problem depends on how precisely the discriminator can be made to be Lipschitz continuous. As representative algorithms, there have been proposed methods of forcibly clipping the weights of the discriminator or adding to the loss function the regularization term to penalize the norm of gradient of the discriminator, but they show undesired behavior. In this paper, techniques, which restrict its norm less than or equal to one, are proposed to stably maintain the Lipschitz continuity of the discriminator without being influenced by choice of training dataset and the performance of the proposed techniques are evaluated through various experiments."
Improving visual relationship detection using linguistic and spatial cues,2020,"['deep learning', 'image retrieval', 'image understanding', 'predicate', 'visual relationship']",,"Detecting visual relationships in an image is important in an image understanding task. It enables higher image understanding tasks, that is, predicting the next scene and understanding what occurs in an image. A visual relationship comprises of a subject, a predicate, and an object, and is related to visual, language, and spatial cues. The predicate explains the relationship between the subject and object and can be categorized into different categories such as prepositions and verbs. A large visual gap exists although the visual relationship is included in the same predicate. This study improves upon a previous study (that uses language cues using two losses) and a spatial cue (that only includes individual information) by adding relative information on the subject and object of the extant study. The architectural limitation is demonstrated and is overcome to detect all zero-shot visual relationships. A new problem is discovered, and an explanation of how it decreases performance is provided. The experiment is conducted on the VRD and VG datasets and a significant improvement over previous results is obtained."

In the traditional field of image process, not only new augmentation methods have been proposed for improving the performance, but also exploring methods for an optimal augmentation policy that can be changed according to the dataset and structure of networks. Inspired by the prior work, this paper aims to explore to search for an optimal augmentation policy in the field of sound data. We carried out many experiments randomly combining various augmentation methods such as adding noise, pitch shift, or time stretch to empirically search which combination is most effective. As a result, by applying the optimal data augmentation policy we achieve the improved classification accuracy on the environmental sound classification dataset (ESC-50)."

Multi-Label Classification of Historical Documents by Using Hierarchical Attention Networks,2020,"['Deep learning', 'Recurrent neural network', 'Text analysis', 'Big data', 'History']",,"The quantitative analysis of digitized historical documents has begun in earnest in recent years. Text classification is of particular importance for quantitative historical analysis because it helps to search literature efficiently and to determine the important subjects of a particular age. While numerous historians have joined together to classify large-scale historical documents, consistent classification among individual researchers has not been achieved. In this study, we present a classification method for large-scale historical data that uses a recently developed supervised learning algorithm called the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN). By applying various classification methods to the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (AJD), we show that HAN is more accurate than conventional techniques with word-frequency-based features. HAN provides the extent that a particular sentence or word contributes to the classification process through a quantitative value called `attention'. We extract the representative keywords from various categories by using the attention mechanism and show the evolution of the keywords over the 472-year span of the AJD. Our results reveal that largely two groups of event categories are found in the AJD. In one group, the representative keywords of the categories were stable over long periods while the keywords in the other group varied rapidly, exhibiting repeatedly changing characteristics of the categories. Observing such macroscopic changes of representative words may provide insight into how a particular topic changes over a historical period."

KOSDAQ을 대상으로 1년 치 종가, 외국인 비율, 금리, 환율 데이터를 다양하게 조합한 후에 딥러닝의 Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXternal input (NARX) 모델을 활용한다. 이 모델을 통해 1달 치 데이터를 생성하고 각 데이터 조합을 통해 만들어진 예측값을 RMSE를 통해 실제값과 비교, 분석한다. 또한, 은닉층에서 뉴런의 수, 지연 시간을 다양하게 설정하여 RMSE를 비교한다. 분석 결과 뉴런은 10개, 지연 시간은 2로 설정하고, 데이터는 미국, 중국, 유럽, 일본 환율의 조합을 사용할 때 RMSE 0.08을 보이며 가장 낮은 오차를 기록하였다. 본 연구는 환율이 주식에 가장 영향을 많이 미친다는 점과 종가 데이터만 사용했을 때의 RMSE 값인 0.589에서 오차를 낮췄다는 점에 의의가 있다.","The stock market is affected by unexpected factors, such as politics, society, and natural disasters, as well as by corporate performance and economic conditions. In recent days, artificial intelligence has become popular, and many researchers have tried to conduct experiments with that. Our study proposes an experiment using not only stock-related data but also other various economic data. We acquired a year""s worth of data on stock prices, the percentage of foreigners, interest rates, and exchange rates, and combined them in various ways. Thus, our input data became diversified, and we put the combined input data into a nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) model. With the input data in the NARX model, we analyze and compare them to the original data. As a result, the model exhibits a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.08 as being the most accurate when we set 10 neurons and two delays with a combination of stock prices and exchange rates from the U.S., China, Europe, and Japan. This study is meaningful in that the exchange rate has the greatest influence on stock prices, lowering the error from RMSE 0.589 when only closing data are used."

This research builds a classification model and conducted an experiments to classify self-introduction essays into pass or fail using deep learning and decision tree techniques. Real world data were classified using stratified sampling to alleviate the data imbalance problem between passed self-introduction essays and failed essays. Documents were embedded using Doc2Vec method developed from existing Word2Vec, and they were classified using logistic regression analysis. The decision tree model was chosen as a benchmark model, and K-fold cross-validation was conducted for the performance evaluation. As a result of several experiments, the area under curve (AUC) value of PV-DM results better than that of other models of Doc2Vec, i.e., PV-DBOW and Concatenate. Furthmore PV-DM classifies passed essays as well as failed essays, while PV_DBOW can not classify passed essays even though it classifies well failed essays. In addition, the classification performance of the logistic regression model embedded using the PV-DM model is better than the decision tree-based classification model. The implication of the experimental results is that company can reduce the cost of recruiting good d job seekers.

Methods: We retrospectivelyanalyzed the abdominal CT scans of 1,003 subjects whose ages ranged between 10 and 90 years. The pancreas was segmentedmanually to define the region of interest (ROI) based on CT images, and then the PVs were measured by counting the voxelsin all ROIs within the pancreas boundary. Sarcopenia was identified by examination of CT images that determined the crosssectionalarea of the skeletal muscle around the third lumbar vertebra. Results: The mean volume of the pancreas was 62.648± 19.094 cm3. The results indicated a negative correlation between the PV and age. There was a positive correlation betweenthe PV and BMI for both sexes, females, and males (r = 0.343, p < 0.001; r = 0.461, p < 0.001; and r = 0.244, p < 0.001, respectively).Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the PV and sarcopenia for females (r = 0.253, p < 0.001) andmales (r = 0.200, p < 0.001).

In this paper, we propose a system model that monitors abnormal behaviors that may cause crimes through real-time video, and when a specific behavior occurs, the surveillance system automatically detects it and responds immediately through an alarm. We are a model that analyzes real-time images from surveillance cameras and uses I3D models from analysis servers to analyze abnormal behavior and deliver notifications to web servers and then to clients.

According to the physical characteristics of smoke diffusion, a concept of visual change image is put forward in this paper, which is constructed by the video motion change state of the suspected smoke regions, and can describe the physical diffusion characteristics of smoke in the time and space domains. In the second stage, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features of visual change images of the suspected smoke regions, in this way to reduce the false alarm caused by the smoke-like objects such as cloud and fog.

Potential of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Crop Classification with Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images,2020,"['Crop classification', 'Deep learning', 'Long short-term memory', 'Multitemporal analysis']",,"This study investigates the potential of bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) for efficient modeling of temporal information in crop classification using multitemporal remote sensing images.Unlike unidirectional LSTM models that consider only either forward or backward states, Bi-LSTM could account for temporal dependency of time-series images in both forward and backward directions. This property of Bi-LSTM can be effectively applied to crop classification when it is difficult to obtain full time-series images covering the entire growth cycle of crops. The classification performance of the Bi-LSTM is compared with that of two unidirectional LSTM architectures (forward and backward) with respect to different input image combinations via a case study of crop classification in Anbadegi, Korea. When full time-series images were used as inputs for classification, the Bi-LSTM outperformed the other unidirectional LSTM architectures; however, the difference in classification accuracy from unidirectional LSTM was not substantial. On the contrary, when using multitemporal images that did not include useful information for the discrimination of crops, the Bi-LSTM could compensate for the information deficiency by including temporal information from both forward and backward states, thereby achieving the best classification accuracy, compared with the unidirectional LSTM. These case study results indicate the efficiency of the Bi-LSTM for crop classification, particularly when limited input images are available."
RNN과 강화 학습을 이용한 자동 문서 제목 생성,2020,"['Title Generation', 'Deep Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning']",,"Lately, a large amount of textual data have been poured out of the Internet and the technology to refine them is needed. Most of these data are long text and often have no title. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a technique to combine the sequence-to-sequence model of RNN and the REINFORCE algorithm to generate the title of the long text automatically. In addition, the TextRank algorithm was applied to extract a summarized text to minimize information loss in order to protect the shortcomings of the sequence-to-sequence model in which an information is lost when long texts are used.

DCNN Optimization Using Multi-Resolution Image Fusion,2020,"['Image Fusion', 'Deep Convolutional Neural Networks', 'Wavelets', 'Image Classification', 'Heterogeneous DCNN Fusion']",,"In recent years, advancements in machine learning capabilities have allowed it to see widespread adoption for tasks such as object detection, image classification, and anomaly detection. However, despite their promise, a limitation lies in the fact that a network’s performance quality is based on the data which it receives. A well-trained network will still have poor performance if the subsequent data supplied to it contains artifacts, out of focus regions, or other visual distortions. Under normal circumstances, images of the same scene captured from differing points of focus, angles, or modalities must be separately analysed by the network, despite possibly containing overlapping information such as in the case of images of the same scene captured from different angles, or irrelevant information such as images captured from infrared sensors which can capture thermal information well but not topographical details. This factor can potentially add significantly to the computational time and resources required to utilize the network without providing any additional benefit. In this study, we plan to explore using image fusion techniques to assemble multiple images of the same scene into a single image that retains the most salient key features of the individual source images while discarding overlapping or irrelevant data that does not provide any benefit to the network. Utilizing this image fusion step before inputting a dataset into the network, the number of images would be significantly reduced with the potential to improve the classification performance accuracy by enhancing images while discarding irrelevant and overlapping regions."

Real-time video Surveillance System Design Proposal Using Abnormal Behavior Recognition Technology,2020,"['Behavior Recognition', 'Deep Learning', 'I3D', 'Video Surveillance System']",,"The surveillance system to prevent crime and accidents in advance has become a necessity, not an option in real life. Not only public institutions but also individuals are installing surveillance cameras to protect their property and privacy. However, since the installed surveillance camera cannot be monitored for 24 hours, the focus is on the technology that tracks the video after an accident occurs rather than prevention. In this paper, we propose a system model that monitors abnormal behaviors that may cause crimes through real-time video, and when a specific behavior occurs, the surveillance system automatically detects it and responds immediately through an alarm. We are a model that analyzes real-time images from surveillance cameras and uses I3D models from analysis servers to analyze abnormal behavior and deliver notifications to web servers and then to clients. If the system is implemented with the proposed model, immediate response can be expected when a crime occurs."

Currently, the demand for electricity has continuously been rising more than ever. Since the industrial sector uses more electricity than any other sectors, the importance of a more precise forecasting model for manufacturing sites has been highlighted to lower the excess energy production. We propose a double encoder-decoder model, which uses two separate encoders and one decoder, in order to adapt both long-term and short-term data for better forecasts. We evaluated our proposed model on our electricity power consumption dataset, which was collected in a manufacturing site of Sehong from January 1st, 2019 to June 30th, 2019 with 1 minute time interval. From the experiment, the double encoder-decoder model marked about 10% reduction in mean absolute error percentage compared to a conventional encoder-decoder model.

Three-stream network with context convolution module for human-object interaction detection,2020,"['context convolution module', 'deep learning', 'HOI detection', 'human-object interactions', 'three-stream network']",,"Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is a popular computer vision task that detects interactions between humans and objects. This task can be useful in many applications that require a deeper understanding of semantic scenes. Current HOI detection networks typically consist of a feature extractor followed by detection layers comprising small filters (eg, 1 × 1 or 3 × 3). Although small filters can capture local spatial features with a few parameters, they fail to capture larger context information relevant for recognizing interactions between humans and distant objects owing to their small receptive regions. Hence, we herein propose a three-stream HOI detection network that employs a context convolution module (CCM) in each stream branch. The CCM can capture larger contexts from input feature maps by adopting combinations of large separable convolution layers and residual-based convolution layers without increasing the number of parameters by using fewer large separable filters. We evaluate our HOI detection method using two benchmark datasets, V-COCO and HICO-DET, and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance."

Underwater image enhancement using symmetrical autoencoder with synthesis datasets,2020,"['Underwater image enhancement', 'Deep learning', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Auto-encoder', 'Skip-connection']",,"The underwater images obtained using optical sensors, such as cameras, have low visibility and color distortion due to underwater environments. To enhance the visibility and color of underwater images, autoencoder-based convolutional neural networks are used recently; however, a basic autoencoder is not effective in color distortion and makes the result images noisy. In this study, we propose an autoencoder with skip-connection called symmetrical autoencoder (SAE) to improve the visibility and color distortion of underwater images. The proposal of this study is twofold: (i) to symmetrically add skip-connections that connect encoders to decoders throughout the network for reconstructing ability of decoders and (ii) to synthesize underwater datasets using an underwater image formation model to train the autoencoder effectively. Through the comparison with other approaches, we show that the proposed autoencoder outperforms them in PSRN, SSIM, and color difference for test datasets. In addition, the proposed autoencoder can well generalize the actual underwater images."

Traffic Flow Prediction Model Based on Spatio-Temporal Dilated Graph Convolution,2020,"['Traffic Flow Prediction', 'Deep Learning', 'Graph Convolution', 'Dilated Convolution']",,"With the increase of motor vehicles and tourism demand, some traffic problems gradually appear, such as traffic congestion, safety accidents and insufficient allocation of traffic resources. Facing these challenges, a model of Spatio-Temporal Dilated Convolutional Network (STDGCN) is proposed for assistance of extracting highly nonlinear and complex characteristics to accurately predict the future traffic flow. In particular, we model the traffic as undirected graphs, on which graph convolutions are built to extract spatial feature informations. Furthermore, a dilated convolution is deployed into graph convolution for capturing multi-scale contextual messages. The proposed STDGCN integrates the dilated convolution into the graph convolution, which realizes the extraction of the spatial and temporal characteristics of traffic flow data, as well as features of road occupancy. To observe the performance of the proposed model, we compare with it with four rivals. We also employ four indicators for evaluation. The experimental results show STDGCN’s effectiveness.

원형 구조 알고리즘을 이용한 근전도 패턴 인식 및 분류,2020,"['Electromyography', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Classification', 'Deep Learning']",,"This paper proposes a pattern recognition and classification algorithm based on a circular structure that can reflect the characteristics of the sEMG (surface electromyogram) signal measured in the arm without putting the placement limitation of electrodes. In order to recognize the same pattern at all times despite the electrode locations, the data acquisition of the circular structure is proposed so that all sEMG channels can be connected to one another. For the performance verification of the sEMG pattern recognition and classification using the developed algorithm, several experiments are conducted. First, although there are no differences in the sEMG signals themselves, the similar patterns are much better identified in the case of the circular structure algorithm than that of conventional linear ones. Second, a comparative analysis is shown with the supervised learning schemes such as MLP, CNN, and LSTM. In the results, the classification recognition accuracy of the circular structure is above 98% in all postures. It is much higher than the results obtained when the linear structure is used. The recognition difference between the circular and linear structures was the biggest with about 4% when the MLP network was used."

The fresh weight, the output of the CNN, was regressed based on the data collected through destructive investigation. The highest coefficient of determination (R<SUP>2</SUP>) of the trained CNN was 0.95. The estimated fresh weight showed a very similar trend to the actual measured value."
압축된 영상 복원을 위한 양자화된 CNN 기반 초해상화 기법,2020,"['Super-Resolution', 'CNN', 'Deep Learning', 'Degradation Model', 'Compressed Image']",,"In this paper, we propose a super-resolution method that reconstructs compressed low-resolution images into high-resolution images. We propose a CNN model with a small number of parameters, and even if quantization is applied to the proposed model, super-resolution can be implemented without deteriorating the image quality. To further improve the quality of the compressed low-resolution image, a new degradation model was proposed instead of the existing bicubic degradation model. The proposed degradation model is used only in the training process and can be applied by changing only the parameter values to the original CNN model. In the super-resolution image applying the proposed degradation model, visual artifacts caused by image compression were effectively removed. As a result, our proposed method generates higher PSNR values at compressed images and shows better visual quality, compared to conventional CNN-based SR methods."

Unsupervised Log Message Anomaly Detection,2020,['Anomaly detectionClassificationDeep learningLog messagesUnsupervised learning'],,"Log messages are now broadly used in cloud and software systems. They are important for classification and anomaly detection as millions of logs are generated each day. In this paper, an unsupervised model for log message anomaly detection is proposed which employs Isolation Forest and two deep Autoencoder networks. The Autoencoder networks are used for training and feature extraction, and then for anomaly detection, while Isolation Forest is used for positive sample prediction. The proposed model is evaluated using the BGL, Openstack and Thunderbird log message data sets. The results obtained show that the number of negative samples predicted to be positive is low, especially with Isolation Forest and one Autoencoder.

The wind power generation can be produced anywhere in the windy place through fixed function. Commonly, the wind power generation is connected to end of system or microgrid, which have a small inertia. The wind power output depends heavily on the wind speed.So, the wind power generation generates irregular power. When irregular wind power is connected to the grid, system quality problem would occur.

It can simultaneously generate missing MT-weighted images and qMT parameters from undersampled MT images. The network was trained and validated with 7-fold cross-validation. Additional testing with unseen data was performed to assess the generalizability of the network. Performance of qMTNet+ was compared with that of qMTNet-1 and qMTNet-acq for fitting and MT images generation, respectively.Results: qMTNet+ achieved quantitative results that were better than qMTNet across all metrics (peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, normalized mean squared error) for both conventional and inter-slice MT data. Produced offset images were better quantitatively than those produced by qMTNet-acq.Conclusion: qMTNet+ improves qMTNet, generating qMT parameters from undersampled MT data with higher agreement with ground truth values. Additionally, qMTNet+ can produce both qMT parameters and unsampled MT images with a single network in an end-to-end manner, obviating the need for separate networks required for qMTNet. qMTNet+ has the potential to accelerate qMT imaging for diagnostic and research purposes."

A Study on Applying the SRCNN Model and Bicubic Interpolation to Enhance Low-Resolution Weeds Images for Weeds Classification,2020,"['super-resolution', 'weeds classification', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning']",,"In the image object classification problem, low-resolution images may have a negative impact on the classification result, especially when the classification method, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, is trained on a high-resolution (HR) image dataset. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of applying a classical super-resolution (SR) method such as bicubic interpolation, and a deep CNN model such as SRCNN to enhance low-resolution (LR) weeds images used for classification. Using an HR dataset, we first train a CNN model for weeds image classification with a default input size of 128×128. Then, given an LR weeds image, we rescale to default input size by applying the bicubic interpolation or the SRCNN model. We analyze these two approaches on the Chonnam National University (CNU) weeds dataset and find that SRCNN is suitable for the image size is smaller than 80×80, while bicubic interpolation is convenient for a larger image."

The doodle robot platform consists of an Android application, a Flask server, and a Dobot robot arm. When a user takes a picture in an Android application through the proposed platform, artificial intelligence reconstructs the picture into a doodle drawing, and then a robot arm with a pen module starts to draw it on paper. The YOLO algorithm detects objects in the photo sent by a user and places the same sized doodle data as the object where the object is located, and reconstructs the picture into a doodle drawing. In the process of reconstruction, the completeness of doodle images was enhanced by excluding objects of a certain size or smaller, allowing only those that are not small in size to be converted into doodle images to create abstract and neat doodle images. As a result, the user-entered photos could be reproduced naturally in doodle drawings. Through the platform proposed by this paper, we expect users to be able to create customized products that contain their own value at home without any special skills or tools."
자동창작시대의 예술 작품 -인공지능은 예술 창작의 주체가 될 수 있는가?,2020,"['Computational creativity', 'Turing test', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Arts']",,"Computational creativity is emerging as a sub-field of computer science; it attempts to make machines the subjects of artistic creations. Therefore, we examine whether machines can be considered the subjects of artistic creations through experiments on audiences’ appreciation of works by artificial intelligence (AI) and humans. According to our qualitative and quantitative findings, audiences reported no significant differences in appreciating works by AI and humans. Thus, it seems inappropriate to declare that “AI cannot be the subject of an artistic creation.”Prior to asking, “Can machines create art?” it is necessary to ask “Isn’t a human a kind of machine?” It is contradictory if we deny that humans are machines, because they are also formed by evolution, a mechanical algorithm. If humans are a type of machine, and if they also make art, eventually, this will come to mean that machines create art. In conclusion, it is not natural to deny the hypothesis, “Machines can be the subjects of artistic creations.”"

Therefore, it is difficult to achieve economies of scale, so cost and time constraints exist. There are already situations in which artificial intelligence is used to overcome such limitations.LH Corporation, SH Corporation, Gyeonggi Housing and Urban Corporation, and other related public enterprises have already used artificial intelligence to review the suitability of business requirements, architectural design conforming to building regulations, and estimate the value of previous assets and estimate the value of new buildings. It is being utilized.As a result of analyzing the case of Uijeongbu City, it is not known that the Gyeonggi Housing and Urban Corporation commissioned a company to review the business feasibility with artificial intelligence, so only four of the 18 Block-unit Renewal projects received a feasibility review and thus need to be promoted. Seems to be. In addition, rather than requesting a company through Gyeonggi Housing and Urban Corporation to receive results or reports unilaterally, the use will be maximized if there is an interaction such as sensitivity analysis for changes such as changes in conditions. In addition, it is also necessary to consider proactively discovering and promoting places that meet the requirements of Block-unit Renewal projects in public sectors such as city and public sector through artificial intelligence.In the future, when more automation is carried out and it becomes possible to analyze business requirements and feasibility directly on the web, it is necessary to prepare for situations such as increasing the effect of improving infrastructure by grouping and promoting adjacent areas."

Three classifications (fresh, healing, and old fracture) combined with fracture location (corresponding CT layers) were detected automatically and delivered in a structured report. Precision, recall, and F1-score were selected as metrics to measure the optimum CNN model. Detection/diagnosis time, precision, and sensitivity were employed to compare the diagnostic efficiency of the structured report and that of experienced radiologists.Results: A total of 25054 annotations (fresh fracture, 10089; healing fracture, 10922; old fracture, 4043) were labelled for training (18584) and validation (6470). The detection efficiency was higher for fresh fractures and healing fractures than for old fractures (F1-scores, 0.849, 0.856, 0.770, respectively, p = 0.023 for each), and the robustness of the model was good in the five multicenter/multiparameter validation sets (all mean F1-scores > 0.8 except validation set 5 [512 x 512 pixels; F1-score = 0.757]). The precision of the five radiologists improved from 80.3% to 91.1%, and the sensitivity increased from 62.4% to 86.3% with artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis. On average, the diagnosis time of the radiologists was reduced by 73.9 seconds.Conclusion: Our CNN model for automatic rib fracture detection could assist radiologists in improving diagnostic efficiency, reducing diagnosis time and radiologists’ workload."

However, it is very likely to cause an accident such as a collision or fall, due to external environmental factors, and research is needed to increase safety. To prevent such risks, UAVs are often equipped with sensors such as laser scanners or cameras. But laser scanners are very heavy and consume high power. Stereo cameras are much lighter and use less power than laser scanners, making them ideal for use in small UAV environments. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a method for estimating the disparity map using a stereo camera and deep learning without using a LiDAR(Lighting Detection And Ranging). The proposed method constructs semi-supervision based neural network to estimate disparity maps. This algorithm can estimate more precise disparity maps than existing matching algorithms."

It analyzes the basic structure of neural networks such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which have often been used to generate creative images. It also notes that the training and evaluation of neural networks with proper sample datasets is a crucial step in selecting the aesthetic features that will compose the generated images. The comparison of deep neural networks with video synthesizers reveals that the creative logic of AI runs on digitally encoded linguistic instructions rather than functioning as a physical apparatus. This means that the paradigm of post-medium art, which has been supported by technological advances, would have to shift further to cover artificial agents.

Having made a draft, authors usually revise, edit, and proofread their documents.We confine ourselves here only to academic writing, focusing on sentence production. While there has been quite some work on this topic, most writing assistance has mainly dealt with grammatical errors, editing and proofreading, the goal being the correction of surface-level problems such as typography, spelling, or grammatical errors.We broaden the scope by also including cases where the entire sentence needs to be rewritten in order to express properly all of the information planned. Hence, Sentence-level Revision (SentRev) becomes part of our writing assistance task.Obviously, systems performing well in this task can be of considerable help for inexperienced authors by producing fluent, well-formed sentences based on the user’s drafts.In order to evaluate our SentRev model, we have built a new, freely available crowdsourced evaluation dataset which consists of a set of incomplete sentences produced by nonnative writers paired with final version sentences extracted from published academic papers.

The accumulated data from devices with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is being used in many ways to build a convenience-based smart system as it can provide customized intelligent systems through user environment and pattern analysis. Recently, it has been applied to innovation in the public domain and has been using it for smart city and smart transportation, such as solving traffic and crime problems using CCTV. In particular, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the easiness of securing real-time service data and the stability of security when planning underground services or establishing movement amount control information system to enhance citizens or commuters’ convenience in circumstances with the congestion of public transportation such as subways, urban railways, etc. However, previous studies that utilize image data have limitations in reducing the performance of object detection under private issue and abnormal conditions.  The IoT device-based sensor data used in this study is free from private issue because it does not require identification for individuals, and can be effectively utilized to build intelligent public services for unspecified people. Especially, sensor data stored by the IoT device need not be identified to an individual, and can be effectively utilized for constructing intelligent public services for many and unspecified people as data free form private issue.  We utilize the IoT-based infrared sensor devices for an intelligent pedestrian tracking system in metro service which many people use on a daily basis and temperature data measured by sensors are therein transmitted in real time. The experimental environment for collecting data detected in real time from sensors was established for the equally-spaced midpoints of 4x4 upper parts in the ceiling of subway entrances where the actual movement amount of passengers is high, and it measured the temperature change for objects entering and leaving the detection spots. The measured data have gone through a preprocessing in which the reference values for 16 different areas are set and the difference values between the temperatures in 16 distinct areas and their reference values per unit of time are calculated. This corresponds to the methodology that maximizes movement within the detection area. In addition, the size of the data was increased by 10 times in order to more sensitively reflect the difference in temperature by area. For example, if the temperature data collected from the sensor at a given time were 28.5°C, the data analysis was conducted by changing the value to 285. As above, the data collected from sensors have the characteristics of time series data and image data with 4x4 resolution. Reflecting the characteristics of the measured, preprocessed data, we finally propose a hybrid algorithm that combines CNN in superior performance for image classification and LSTM, especially suitable for analyzing time series data, as referred to CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory).  In the study, the CNN-LSTM algorithm is used to predict the number of passing persons in one of 4x4 detection areas. We verified the validation of the proposed model by taking performance comparison with other artificial intelligence algorithms such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and RNN-LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory).

Additionally, as knowledge graphs are used for various research and services, there is a need to secure quality knowledge graphs. However, there is a lack of research to detect errors within the knowledge graphs to obtain quality knowledge graphs. Previous studies using the embedding and clustering for error triple detection showed good performance. However, in the process of the cluster optimization, there was a problem that the characteristics of each cluster could not be factored using the same threshold collectively. In this paper, to resolve these problems, we propose an adaptive clustering model in which clustering is conducted by finding and applying the optimum threshold for each cluster with the embedding for knowledge graph for error triple detection in the knowledge graph. To evaluate the performance of the method proposed in this paper, the existing error triple detection studies and comparative experiments were conducted on three datasets, DBpeida, Frebase and WiseKB, and the high performance was confirmed by an average of 5.3% based on the F1-Score."

PC-SAN: Pretraining-Based Contextual Self-Attention Model for Topic Essay Generation,2020,"['Natural language generation', 'Essay generation', 'Pretraining-based method', 'Self-attention network', 'Deep learning']",,"Automatic topic essay generation (TEG) is a controllable text generation task that aims to generate informative, diverse, and topic-consistent essays based on multiple topics. To make the generated essays of high quality, a reasonable method should consider both diversity and topic-consistency. Another essential issue is the intrinsic link of the topics, which contributes to making the essays closely surround the semantics of provided topics. However, it remains challenging for TEG to fill the semantic gap between source topic words and target output, and a more powerful model is needed to capture the semantics of given topics. To this end, we propose a pretraining-based contextual self-attention (PC-SAN) model that is built upon the seq2seq framework. For the encoder of our model, we employ a dynamic weight sum of layers from BERT to fully utilize the semantics of topics, which is of great help to fill the gap and improve the quality of the generated essays. In the decoding phase, we also transform the target-side contextual history information into the query layers to alleviate the lack of context in typical self-attention networks (SANs). Experimental results on large-scale paragraph-level Chinese corpora verify that our model is capable of generating diverse, topic-consistent text and essentially makes improvements as compare to strong baselines. Furthermore, extensive analysis validates the effectiveness of contextual embeddings from BERT and contextual history information in SANs."

Most of the existing studies related to this are forecasting studies that use news information or macroeconomic indicators that create market fluctuations, or reflect only a few combinations of indicators. In this paper, this we propose to present an effective combination of the news information sentiment analysis and various macroeconomic indicators in order to predict the US Dow Jones Index. After Crawling more than 93,000 business news from the New York Times for two years, the sentiment results analyzed using the latest natural language processing techniques BERT and NLTK, along with five macroeconomic indicators, gold prices, oil prices, and five foreign exchange rates affecting the US economy Combination was applied to the prediction algorithm LSTM, which is known to be the most suitable for combining numeric and text information. As a result of experimenting with various combinations, the combination of DJI, NLTK, BERT, OIL, GOLD, and EURUSD in the DJI index prediction yielded the smallest MSE value."

These scholars showed deep interest in this mundane technique, as could be seen through their communication with each other. While their works touching on techniques of producing things have been largely characterized as “empirical,” “practical,” and “proven,” this paper argues that their method to pursue “practical studies” and their meaning of practicalities (實) were quite different from what we can expect from the terms “seeing and hearing (見聞),” and “proving by experience (徵驗).” Their main way of “seeing and hearing” was through texts that helped them know the right way of the ideal sage rule, and their “proving” was to confirm their informed faith in the right ways proven in previous texts. The practicalities that they obtained and aimed were thus not through the actual observations of technical realities in Joseon papermaking, but mostly through their intellectual politics."
Implementation of Cough Detection System Using IoT Sensor in Respirator,2020,"['COVID-19', 'Smart Sensor', 'IoT', 'Non-Powered Hood Respirator', 'Mel-Spectrogram', 'Deep Learning', 'CNN']",,"Worldwide, the number of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confirmed cases is rapidly increasing. Although vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 are being developed, the disease is unlikely to disappear completely. By attaching a smart sensor to the respirator worn by medical staff, Internet of Things (IoT) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) technology can be used to automatically detect the medical staff's infection symptoms. In the case of medical staff showing symptoms of the disease, appropriate medical treatment can be provided to protect the staff from the greater risk. In this study, we design and develop a system that detects cough, a typical symptom of respiratory infectious diseases, by applying IoT technology and artificial technology to respiratory protection. Because the cough sound is distorted within the respirator, it is difficult to guarantee accuracy in the AI model learned from the general cough sound. Therefore, coughing and non-coughing sounds were recorded using a sensor attached to a respirator, and AI models were trained and performance evaluated with this data. Mel-spectrogram conversion method was used to efficiently classify sound data, and the developed cough recognition system had a sensitivity of 95.12% and a specificity of 100%, and an overall accuracy of 97.94%."

Even though deep convolutional neural networks, which have recently attracted great attention in the field of image restoration, are applied to rain streaks removal, residual rain streaks on the flat areas and deterioration of texture sharpness in the texture areas remain current issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a restoration method that can effectively remove rain streaks and enhance texture’s sharpness from input rain images. In particular, by estimating the edge map, which is the result of Laplacian filtering applied to the original image, the structure-aware residual network that is able to adaptive to image structures is introduced to remove the rain streaks in the flat areas and enhance the sharpness in the detail areas. Moreover, through experimental evaluation, it is confirmed that the proposed structure-aware residual network can achieve the desired purpose and obtain better performance in quantitative evaluation than the existing state-of-the-art methods."

First, there is a question whether artificial intelligence generated works can be copyrightable. Because artificial intelligence has no ideas or emotions, even if it is created by autonomous artificial intelligence, there arises a question of whether it can not be protected under the definition of Article 2 of the current copyright law. If so, then there is a issue about whether there are any protection measures for the producer who developed and invested for such autonomously strong artificial intelligence. In the end, under the current copyright law, It is doubtful whether artificial intelligence’s autonomously created creations can be construed as an object that can not be protected. If so, the challenge is how to bridge the gap between legislative deficiencies and the need for protection. In this article, we will look at several legal issues that can be predicted, especially focused on our copyright law, in conjunction with the unpredictable growth rate of artificial intelligence (AI) which associated Big Data. Unlike traditional works of art whose works are protected by the Copyright Act, our available current copyright regimes can’t protect the autonomously strong artificial intelligence generated works. So we have a challenge to find new safeguards in the copyright law."

Abstractive text summarization involves using pre-generated word embedding information. Low-frequency but salient words such as terminologies are seldom included in dictionaries, that are so called, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problems. OOV deteriorates the performance of the encoder-decoder model in the neural network. To address OOV words in abstractive text summarization, we propose a copy mechanism to facilitate copying new words in the target document and generating summary sentences. Different from previous studies, the proposed approach combines accurately pointing information, selective copy mechanism, embedded by BERT, randomly masking OOV, and converting sentences from morpheme. Additionally, the neural network gate model to estimate the generation probability and the loss function to optimize the entire abstraction model was applied. Experimental results demonstrate that ROUGE-1 (based on word recall) and ROUGE-L (longest used common subsequence) of the proposed encoding-decoding model have been improved at 54.97 and 39.23, respectively."

To do this, the user can calculate the pose of the user by analyzing the video using a deep learning technique, and track the movement of a selected body part. The second is to analyze the movement trajectory of the selected body part and calculate the location and time of hitting the object. Finally, the trajectory of the object is generated using the analyzed hitting information. Then, a natural object lifting scenes synchronized with the input user's video can be generated.

The conventional activation function does not have a relationship with the loss function, so the process of finding the optimal solution is slow. In order to improve this, an agile activation function that generalizes the activation function is proposed. The agile activation function can improve the performance of the deep neural network in a way that selects the optimal agile parameter through the learning process using the primary differential coefficient of the loss function for the agile parameter in the backpropagation process. Through the MNIST classification problem, we have identified that agile activation functions have superior performance over conventional activation functions."

For example, we are often confronted by new vocabularies such as Fourth Industrial Revolution, Deep Learning, Big Data, AlphaGo and Autonomous Driving which are closely linked to artificial intelligence through various mass media in everyday life. This means that in contemporary society, artificial intelligence is in high demand; hence, it is usually considered an icon and symbol of not only the most advanced technology but also the most efficient and creative invention for human societies. However, some warnings and alerts have also been raised about the gradual replacement of every aspects of all human spheres by artificial intelligence to sustain social and cultural values such as kinship, social rituals and religion in traditional human societies. In that sense, Huxley’s early 20thcentury novel Brave New World reflects the importance of these social and cultural elements in traditional human societies. Thus, in this paper, I analyze some perspectives on the era of artificial intelligence that are embedded within Huxley’s novel, focusing on the ”body“. As far as kinship is concerned, cybots do not have a kinship network. This is because cybots are normally manufactured like machines in large quantities, whereas humans are bound together with kinship either by birth (consanguineal kinship) or by marriage (affinal kinship). Along the same lines, in Huxley’s description of mass reproduction, most babies are born through artificial insemination and are classified into five social classes through the manipulation of genes as well as the developmental environment. Therefore, the future humans in Huxley’s novel do not establish kin memberships such as father, mother, son, and daughter. Thus, they do not keep equivalent kinship terms. In comparison, the aborigines in Huxley’s novel maintain traditional human values such as kinship and kinship terms. In addition, as far as social rituals and religion are concerned, the future human society in Brave New World shows that all humans share everything with other humans; thus, every man can love every woman and vice versa. There exists neither marriage nor any restrictions. In addition, Huxley’s novel portrays death as a cheerful moment, where corpses are cremated and only leave phosphorus fertilizer for the soil. Hence, future humans do not share feelings of awe towards the human spirit and ancestor worship. In this context, future humans in Brave New World currently look like cybots. In other words, we usually believe that the bodies of cybots do not consist of symbolic elements of human kinship, such as bone, blood and flesh. Furthermore, in traditional societies, the human body is often cosmologically divided into the physical body and the spirit after death. Last, Huxley’s novel Brave New World could raise a fresh alarm in the era of artificial intelligence, that is, artificial intelligence is continuously developed to provide ultimate efficiency and convenience for humans. However, like the civilized human society in Brave New World, the immoderately fast-growing development of artificial intelligence in contemporary society will bring a deterioration of humanity and of traditional human values such as kinship, rituals, and religion."

The relationship between humans and AI is legally important, as there are views that artificial intelligence needs to be recognized as a legal entity and that artificial intelligence needs to be held accountable for its action just like humans. If artificial intelligence has free will, there is no reason to treat AI differently from humans.In order to examine whether AI can have free will, it is necessary to define the concept of free will. Free will can be divided into freedom and will. Freedom means being free from physical causes, but the definition of freedom in this way cannot explain the fact that the brain is governed by the laws of physics. To avoid this inconsistency, freedom can be defined as unpredictability and the unknownness of causes. In reality, we can not distinguish the unknownness of causes from nonexistence of causes. In this respect, the human brain is free, because the causes of the brain's judgment can not be physically identified. Will means a mental state that is motivated to achieve a certain purpose. Motivation means desire and dread, or the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. The desire can be divided into first order desire which is directly related to survival or reproduction and second order desire such as curiosity, desire of power, and the pursuit of wealth. Among these two types of desire, only the second order desire is related to the will. In order to recognize the free will of AI, the information processing of AI should be unpredictable and AI should have second order desires. It is impossible to determine the cause of the AI output value. Therefore, information processing of AI is as free as the human brain. However, the activity of the human brain is more difficult to predict than AI because metacognition and self-awareness, or high level awareness is the key attributes of human mind. It is unclear whether high-level awareness of AI based on metacognition is possible. If high-level thinking of AI is impossible, AI is less free than humans.In order for AI to have a will, it must have desire or dread. While desire and dread are motivations for humans, it is not clear how these motivations are working in the brain's information processing. Therefore, in order to make the algorithm of motivations such as desire and dread, we must first reveal the secrets of the human brain. Unlocking the secrets of the brain eventually means unlocking the secret of the beginning of life, which seems to be difficult in the near future. Even if we reveal the secrets of the brain, it is not certain that the algorithm of motivation can be technically developed. Considering these points, it is difficult for AI to have a will. As a result, AI cannot have free will because it has a lower level of freedom than humans, and it is difficult to have will."
Multichannel Convolution Neural Network Classification for the Detection of Histological Pattern in Prostate Biopsy Images,2020,"['Histological', 'Prostate Biopsy', 'Multichannel', 'Stain Normalization', 'Classification']",,"The analysis of digital microscopy images plays a vital role in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and prognosis. The main purpose of this paper is to develop a machine learning technique to predict the histological grades in prostate biopsy. To perform a multiclass classification, an AI-based deep learning algorithm, a multichannel convolutional neural network (MCCNN) was developed by connecting layers with artificial neurons inspired by the human brain system. The histological grades that were used for the analysis are benign, grade 3, grade 4, and grade 5. The proposed approach aims to classify multiple patterns of images extracted from the whole slide image (WSI) of a prostate biopsy based on the Gleason grading system. The Multichannel Convolution Neural Network (MCCNN) model takes three input channels (Red, Green, and Blue) to extract the computational features from each channel and concatenate them for multiclass classification. Stain normalization was carried out for each histological grade to standardize the intensity and contrast level in the image. The proposed model has been trained, validated, and tested with the histopathological images and has achieved an average accuracy of 96.4%, 94.6%, and 95.1%, respectively."
Lightweight CNN-based Expression Recognition on Humanoid Robot,2020,"['Humanoid Robot', 'Human-machine interaction', 'CNN', 'Emotion Recognition']",,"The human expression contains a lot of information that can be used to detect complex conditions such as pain and fatigue. After deep learning became the mainstream method, the traditional feature extraction method no longer has advantages. However, in order to achieve higher accuracy, researchers continue to stack the number of layers of the neural network, which makes the real-time performance of the model weak. Therefore, this paper proposed an expression recognition framework based on densely concatenated convolutional neural networks to balance accuracy and latency and apply it to humanoid robots. The techniques of feature reuse and parameter compression in the framework improved the learning ability of the model and greatly reduced the parameters. Experiments showed that the proposed model can reduce tens of times the parameters at the expense of little accuracy."

UWB 시스템에서 실내 측위를 위한 순환 신경망 기반 거리 추정,2020,[],,"This paper proposes a new distance estimation technique for indoor localization in ultra wideband (UWB) systems. The proposed technique is based on recurrent neural network (RNN), one of the deep learning methods. The RNN is known to be useful to deal with time series data, and since UWB signals can be seen as a time series data, RNN is employed in this paper. Specifically, the transmitted UWB signal passes through IEEE802.15.4a indoor channel model, and from the received signal, the RNN regressor is trained to estimate the distance from the transmitter to the receiver. To verify the performance of the trained RNN regressor, new received UWB signals are used and the conventional threshold based technique is also compared. For the performance measure, root mean square error (RMSE) is assessed. According to the computer simulation results, the proposed distance estimator is always much better than the conventional technique in all signal-to-noise ratios and distances between the transmitter and the receiver."

Leading platforms such as Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon have established themselves to exercise significant monopoly power through data accumulation and use. In response to these developments, the European Union (EU) and Japan are among the first to develop legislation and rules for data protection and transparency and fairness of the platform trading environment.Platform businesses have enriched people’s lives, encouraged economic growth, and expanded globally. Platform characteristics, such as network effect, tipping effect, and lock in effect, are likely to cause monopolies in the platform market, which could lead to disadvantages for consumers and business partners, as well as impediments to innovation. Therefore, competition policies for platform businesses and data are becoming important internationally. One of the major concerns regarding competition policy is how to develop a competitive environment in the digital field such as platform.Competition authorities should develop competition policies focusing on whether new challenges by new entrants are being hampered or whether innovation is being suppressed by abuse.As long as oligopolies and monopolies by digital platforms are secured through innovation, competition authorities should not consider them problematic. However, when a digital platform abuses its dominant position and inflicts undue disadvantages on consumers and business partners, distorting fair competition or unjustly eliminating new entrants who may become its own competitors, it should not be overlooked in terms of competition policy. In the digital age, the delay in enforcement by competition authorities hinders competition for a longer period of time than conventional markets.Therefore, it is important for competition authorities not to act after the problem grows, but to take immediate action.Platform concentration of data is also a phenomenon of interest in competition law enforcement.There is a need for legislation and law enforcement to ensure access to data. Legal policy issues include how to evaluate competition within platforms and between platforms. Innovation through data is important, and we need to consider what role data plays in competition. It is important to look at the types of data when considering the impact on competition. Factors affecting competition include whether digital platforms allow everyone to collect and share data, whether multi-homing of platforms are allowed, and whether data collection and accumulation are highly transparent.While platform behavior itself is aimed at creating new value and provides low-cost, high-quality services, it also has the effect of eliminating competitors and inflicting disadvantages on consumers.Therefore, it is an urgent task to determine the balance between the two and to implement competition policies. Competition authorities should aim to eliminate competition-restricting practices without inhibiting innovation, secure the interests of digital platform users, and achieve sustainable economic growth."

However, to achieve robust and accurate earthquake event classification on the seismic observation network, the method using the information from the multi-site observations is needed, instead of using only single-site data. Firstly, our proposed model employs convolution neural networks to extract informative embedding features from the single-site observation. Secondly, graph convolution networks are used to integrate the features from several stations. To evaluate our model, we explore the model structure and the number of stations for ablation study.

To improve the separation quality of the NMF, it includes noise update technique that learns and adapts the characteristics of the current noise in real time. The noise update technique analyzes the sparsity and activity of the noise bias at the present time and decides the update training based on the noise candidate group obtained every frame in the previous noise reduction stage. Noise bias ranks selected as candidates for update training are updated in real time with discrimination NMF training. This NMF was applied to CNN and Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to achieve improvement for performance of sound event detection.

In the experiments using KOMPSAT-3A, DRNet using both a PAN and MS image tended to overfit the spectral characteristics, and DRNet using only a PAN image showed a spatial resolution improvement over existing CNN-based models."

Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery for Pelvic Organ Prolapse among Peri- and Post-Menopausal Women,2020,"['Pelvic organ prolapse', 'Robotics', 'Sacrocolpopexy', 'Urogynecology']",,"For patients with apical compartment pelvic organ prolapse (POP), abdominal sacrocolpopexy has been considered superior to the vaginal approach in terms of less dyspareunia and decreased risk of recurrence. Robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RSC) can help overcome difficulties in laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) by facilitating deep dissection and suturing. Moreover, RSC is a safe and efficacious option for patients with POP. It has several benefits, such as its high anatomical cure rate, improvement of sexual function, reduction of perioperative complications, and low recurrence rate. In addition, it can be a safe option for elderly patients. RSC has a steep learning curve and numerous other reported advantages compared with LSC; however, insufficient data conclude that the former is universally superior, especially in cost effectiveness. Thus, further studies are needed to support the widespread adoption of robot-assisted surgery for pelvic floor reconstruction."

CNN based Sound Event Detection Method using NMF Preprocessing in Background Noise Environment,2020,"['Non-negative matrix', 'CNN', 'artificial neural networks', 'Sound Event Detection', 'Signal to Noise Ratio']",,"Sound event detection in real-world environments suffers from the interference of non-stationary and time-varying noise. This paper presents an adaptive noise reduction method for sound event detection based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). In this paper, we proposed a deep learning model that integrates Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). To improve the separation quality of the NMF, it includes noise update technique that learns and adapts the characteristics of the current noise in real time. The noise update technique analyzes the sparsity and activity of the noise bias at the present time and decides the update training based on the noise candidate group obtained every frame in the previous noise reduction stage. Noise bias ranks selected as candidates for update training are updated in real time with discrimination NMF training. This NMF was applied to CNN and Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to achieve improvement for performance of sound event detection. Since CNN has a more obvious performance improvement effect, it can be widely used in sound source based CNN algorithm."

Among these technologies, one of the artificial intelligence techniques, the deep learning technique is used.As another method, a method of detecting an object using a stereo vision camera is also used. However, these techniques require expensive hardware equipment because of the computational complexity of used to detect objects. However, most video equipments have a significant decrease in computational processing power, and thus, in order to detect passengers on the bus, there is a need for an image processing technology suitable for various equipment using a relatively low computational technique. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a technique that can efficiently obtain the number of passengers on the bus by detecting the contour of the object through the background subtraction suitable for low-cost equipment. Experiments have shown that passengers were counted with approximately 70% accuracy on lower-end machines than those equipped with stereo vision camera."

However, these methods are forced to maintain the size of the feature map to extract the segmentation map as the model would be constructed without a pooling operation.As a result, the performance of these methods is deteriorated with a lack of sparsity and a small receptive field.To mitigate these problems, we utilize GLU to control the flow of information and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to increase the receptive field without additional learning parameters. For the performance evaluation, we employ a URBAN-SED and self-organized bird sound dataset. The relevant experiments show that our proposed DCGLU model outperforms over other baselines. In particular, our method is shown to exhibit robustness against nature sound noises with three Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) levels (20 dB, 10 dB and 0 dB)."

Artificial intelligence through algorithms continues to develop in many areas, not only in the general manufacturing industry, but also in deep learning artificial intelligence, the Internet of things in which objects and objects communicate, unmanned autonomous vehicles, and treatment or surgery on behalf of patients. An artificial intelligence doctor is a representative example. Corona 19, which started in China in February 2020, came unexpectedly to us. The Krona 19 pandemic has an unprecedented impact on business, economy and our society. Due to Corona 19, face-to-face business is rapidly changing centering on non-face-to-face transactions through the Internet, mobile, and platforms. You are asking for distance. Artificial intelligence, which has continued to develop while establishing itself as the nucleus of the 4th industrial revolution, is doubling its speed due to an unexpected variable called Corona 19. Of course, it is true that advances in mobile and internet are increasing the effectiveness of artificial intelligence. This paper examines the social impacts of artificial intelligence and Corona 19 on us, and suggests our legal countermeasures accordingly. The emergence and development of artificial intelligence not only enriches our quality of life, but also requires us to think differently about the framework of thinking that has been adapted to the past. From the controversial telemedicine debate in the medical field, to the treatment of patients through artificial intelligence, and furthermore, the emergence of artificial intelligence doctors, the imagination of human life is once again awakened. In the case of a doctor s treatment practice, which is based on face-to-face, it is based on the safety of the patient. However, if the patient s safety is more and more secured by the advancement of technology, the argument against telemedicine with the patient s life as security would be a concern. If there is a set of selfishness that will not let go of the benefits that come from face to face, then that intention must be put down. If the intelligence of humans and animals is called natural intelligence, artificial intelligence is the information processing mechanism that realizes such natural intelligence in computers. The emergence of weak artificial intelligence will be a period of peace between humans and artificial intelligence, which can pursue the coexistence of both. However, just like humans, artificial intelligence that has an autonomous consciousness and makes independent judgments on its own cannot be seen as a simple instrumental function of humans. Now, artificial intelligence will develop into the question of whether it can coexist with humans or maintain peace. Such an appearance has already recognized its true nature in the movie “Terminator” that shocked us in the early 1980s. Can a just society be realized in the age of artificial intelligence? In the medical field related to doctors, the relationship between the two is unlikely to be very large. However, if you think about it a bit beyond the medical field, the advent of artificial intelligence will hurt jobs in our labor market. Now, artificial intelligence will focus on the problem of how to solve the human jobs disappearing along with the employment problem and the resulting income and distribution. At this time, as an alternative from the standpoint of justice, the imposition of a robot tax or the introduction of basic income will face us."

To identify and quantify these trace compounds in MA seizures, a practical and feasible approach for conducting chromatographic fingerprinting with a suite of traditional chemometric methods and recently introduced machine learning approaches was examined. This was achieved using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS). Following appropriate examination of all the peaks in 71 samples, 166 impurities were selected as the characteristic components. Unsupervised (principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and K-means clustering) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), support vector machines (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN) with Keras) chemometric techniques were employed for classifying the 71 MA seizures. The results of the PCA, HCA, K-means clustering, PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, SVM, and DNN methods for quality evaluation were in good agreement. However, the tested MA seizures possessed distinct features, such as chirality, cutting agents, and boiling points. The study indicated that the established qualitative and semi-quantitative methods will be practical and useful analytical tools for characterizing trace compounds in illicit MA seizures. Moreover, they will provide a statistical basis for identifying the synthesis route, sources of supply, trafficking routes, and connections between seizures, which will support drug law enforcement agencies in their effort to eliminate organized MA crime."

For forecasting the F2 parameters, we adopt the method of long short-term memory (LSTM), which, unlike traditional neural networks, can shed light on sequential variation in time-series data. The inputs of the LSTM model are sequential data for the past 24 hours, which includes the sunspot number (SSN), the daily F10.7 solar flux, geomagnetic the Ap and Kp indices, the foF2 and the hmF2. The foF2 and the hmF2 data used to train the model are measured by the Jeju ionosonde, operated by the Korean Space Weather Center (KSWC) during the period from 2011 through 2016.

On geomagnetic quiet days, the LSTM model showed the best performance among the three models. When the RMSEs of the foF2 (hmF2) predictions were compared, the percentage improvements of the LSTM model were 45% (30%) or more than those of the other models during geomagnetically quiet days. On geomagnetic storm days, however, the LSTM model did not improve predictions any better than the IRI-2016 model, which may be due to the limited amount of training data under the storm condition."

In the first part of the book, Comenius proposes the importance of the moral education. He does not only write about the principles of the efficient teaching and learning, but he also shows his deep interest in moral education. In this article, I first discuss the characteristics of Comenius’s virtue. According to him, the nature of human beings consists of reason, virtue and piety. Among them, virtue is the internal and external movements of human disposition that seeks order and harmony. In the light of Christianity, Comenius sees the world as a place created by God and containing the divine law. For him, the life of order and harmony signifies the life that follows the law of God, which is virtuous. As educational methods for virtue, I suggest ‘imitation’, ‘the thinking of generalization’, and ‘temperance and discipline’ based on Comenius’s epistemology and the methods for moral education presented in The Great Didactic. With such methods, students internalize the order of virtue through their senses, find harmony with objects in the world through generalization, and come into the world of order and harmony through temperance and discipline. Through such education, students are to cultivate the virtue of order and harmony."

The bottom line of this study can be formulated as follows: First, inclusive society or inclusive state imagine the nation as a diverse and inclusive community. Civic education is able to make an important contribution by way of enlightening about the problems and preconditions surrounding the more inclusive society or state than now. Second, inclusive civic education aims to make approach, participation and self-determination possible in all of social areas for each man based on the personal needs. Third, we should pay attention to didactic orientations having a deep affinity with inclusive civic education, especially to participant, activity, life-world, diversity (plurality), and integration orientations. Such orientations need to be appropriately considered in exploring practical ways or strategies. Fourth, while human rights and basic rights are starting point of an inclusive approach on the one hand, but, conversely, they are also criteria for setting the limitations of inclusive approach on the other. Fifth, we need to explore future-oriented ways for activating inclusive civic education for the formation of inclusive society or state. In this context, we should also stress on the so-called bridge-problem between theory and practice and on the problem related to institutionalization."

Although these images are valuable as they can be used to solve difficult problems using data-based methods, such as deep learning, they still remain unavailable because it is expensive to digitize them. For these reasons, we propose a model comprised of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and fully convolutional network (FCN) to digitize tabular images. We used some ResNet components as they are well-suited to the characteristics of tabular image data. A training set for each model was constructed by writing symbols in blank tables and then augmenting them.

Personalized diet oriented by artificial intelligence and ethnic foods,2020,"['Fourth industrial revolution', 'Artificial intelligence (AI)', 'Personalized diet', 'Foodomics', 'Epigenetics']",,"In the future, societies will endeavor to move beyond the framework of the industrial economy and the world will enter a new era marked by super-aged populations, artificial intelligence (AI), and the lifestyle economy. It is predicted that humanity will shift away from the industrial economy to a lifestyle economy where the main focus is human happiness. Human thought and behavior is influenced by emotions and cannot be explained entirely through rational decision-making. Accordingly, AI and other super connection technologies that drive big data and deep learning will facilitate the introduction of personalized and decentralized services, which represent a shift away from the era of mass production, centralization and automation. This means that more attention will be paid to designing unique lifestyles instead of production. In the future, super-aged societies will no longer be steeped in individualism, and become more people-centric. In such societies, obtaining an accurate understanding of people’s noneun style (other activities style beyond working as leisure, play, and others) and dietary style to deliver personalized foods conducive to healthy eating and healthy lifestyles will be of great importance. Personalized diets will be developed based on structured data drawn from human genes, which do not change. However, unstructured data about epigenetics and microbiomes, which can be influenced by lifestyle and diet, will be important for designing personalized foods and lifestyles. Diversity in foods is the most important factor in generating this unstructured data. Because the responsibility for maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle falls on individuals, developing personalized food and lifestyle products is an important step towards reaching the centenarian era. Developing personalized diets requires technologies such as super-connectivity, AI, and the Internet of humans (IoHuman) rather the internet of things (IoT), but researching these technologies is not a job for the food industry. Technologies developed in other fields can be used in food science research, and these technologies fall under the umbrella of “foodomics.” Such technologies include genetic analysis, whole genome sequence analysis, nutrigenomics, metabolomics, nutrigenetics, nutriepigenetics, microbiome technology, sensomics, and culturomics, as well as “sikdanomics.” Korea has a lot of potential when it comes to personalized foods and diets. Because Korea has a long agricultural history, the country has a wide range of natural foods, and many ways to prepare and eat these foods. This means that Korean foods, in particular traditional Korean foods, are well positioned to meet the demand for diversity in personalized foods. In a super-aged era characterized by AI, Korea has a good chance of becoming a country where people can live to 100 in good health and also has the potential to be a global leader in personalized diets. To achieve this, food scientists and medical professionals need to work together to convince the Korean government to lead the industry in the right direction."

The conclusion is as follows.First, Ilyeon was born 589 years after Wonhyo. However, as a characteristic of the times, they have a common point in that they lived in the era of war, the era of Buddhism, and the era of integration.Second, in terms of space, both Wonhyo and Ilyeon were born in Gyeongsan, and the gyeongju has an important meaning in their lives. Wonhyo mainly lived in Gyeongju, Ilyeon mainly lived in the Yeongnam area near Gyeongju. Ilyeon did not live in Gyeongju for a long time. But he had a deep interest in the cultural sites of Gyeongju. For Wonhyo and Ilyeon, Gyeongju was their spiritual home.Third, Wonhyo and Ilyeon found the basis for social integration in Silla and Buddhism, and based on it established their writing philosophy. Wonhyo was in charge of the task of the period through the writing of Ilonhwajaeng, and Ilyeon through the writing of ilyujunghaeng. Wonhyo's the writing of Ilonhwajaeng is 'writing that fuses and communicates different theories', and Ilyeon's the writing of ilyujunghaeng is 'writing that fuses and communicates different ways of life'. There is something in common between the two people in that they aimed at writing to actively unite and communicate different things.Fourth, Wonhyo and Ilyeon showed a similar way of life, sharing time, space and writing philosophy like this. It was the pursuit of a world of learning, converging and repenting in academic terms, the pursuit of a life of one merit and substance in practical terms, and the sharing of interest in the way of Zen Buddhism in the way of Buddhism Training."

인공지능 모델을 이용한 청소년들의 천식 질환 발생 예측 모델,2020,"['Artificial Neural Networks', 'Asthma', 'Teenager', 'Support Vector Machine']",,"With the recent increase in asthma, asthma has become recognized as one of the diseases. The perception that bronchial asthma is a chronic disease and requires treatment has been strengthened. In addition, asthma is recognized as a dangerous disease due to environmental changes and efforts are made to minimize these risks. However, the environmental impact on asthma is hardly a factor that individuals in asthmatic patients can cope with. Therefore, this study was conducted to see if the asthma disease could be replaced by the individual efforts of asthma patients. In particular, since the management of asthma is important during adolescence, we conducted research on asthma in teenagers. Utilizing support vector machines, artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques that have recently drawn attention, we propose models to predict the asthma of teenagers. The study also provides guidelines to avoid factors that can cause asthma in teenagers."

Fatigue defects in the bogie can be initiated for various reasons, such as material imperfection, welding defects, and unpredictable and excessive overloads during operation. To prevent the derailment of a railway vehicle, it is necessary to evaluate and detect the defect of a connection weldment between the car body and bogie accurately. The safety of the bogie weldment was checked using an ultrasonic test, and it is necessary to determine the occurrence of defects using a learning method. Recently, studies on deep learning have been performed to identify defects with a high recognition rate with respect to a fine and similar defect. In this paper, the databases of weldment specimens with artificial defects were constructed to detect the defect of a bogie weldment. The ultrasonic inspection using the wedge angle was performed to understand the detection ability of fatigue cracks. In addition, the convolutional neural network was applied to minimize human error during the inspection.

Minimally invasive robotic total mesorectal excision (RTME) has recently been gaining popularity as robotic surgical systems potentially provide greater benefits than LTME. Compared to LTME, RTME is associated with lower conversion rates and similar or better genitourinary functions, but its long-term oncological outcomes have not been established. Although the operating time of RTME is longer than that of LTME, RTME has a shorter learning curve, is more convenient for surgeons, and is better for sphincter-preserving operations than LTME. The robotic surgical system is a good technical tool for minimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer, especially in male patients with narrow deep pelvises. Robotic systems and robotic surgical techniques are still improving, and the contribution of RTME to the treatment of rectal cancer will continue to increase in the future."

Models of innovation scaling in Singapore schools: process objects as multi-level role clusters and outcomes—a multiple case study approach,2020,"['CHAT', 'Innovation scaling', 'Multi-leveled roles', 'Multiple case studies', 'Pedagogical change', 'School reform']",,"Studying the processes involved in scaling technologically-mediated pedagogical innovations has moved into understanding how wider contexts relate to qualitative outcomes (depth, shift in reform ownership and spread). Understanding patterns in this relationship has been complicated by the diverse outcomes for a single innovation. This study examined the processes involved in scaling innovations, using the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory to view process as object, relating outcomes with the roles played by stakeholders in multiple layers of the school ecosystem (teachers, school leaders and cross-school personnel). The idea of multiple meanings in language facilitated the conceptualization of qualitatively different roles and outcomes. Multiple school cases (from different innovations) underwent cross-case comparison to create a typology of approaches to scaling. Three scaling models—sets of role combinations and related outcomes, were described: (1) Tech-Tools and Artifacts En Masse focused on across-the-board adoption of technology. (2) Deep Roots selected a core team to overhaul teaching approaches, with accompanying structural changes (in schedule, personnel involvement and professional learning communities). (3) Networks established partnerships among schools from the onset. The roles for each ecosystem level, for each model, were further explicated to relate roles and outcomes. This study emphasizes the importance of foregrounding the process objects—the meta-level—of scaling, articulating the processes that affect outcomes. The models offer school leaders and those involved in innovation implementation (e.g., innovation designers, academic consultants, teacher educators working across schools) a framework to dialog, evaluate existing implementation strategies, and articulate next steps in school innovation trajectories."

Buddhist paintings have established itself as a long-standing culture in Korea beyond a religious meaning. This understanding and learning of Buddhist paintings helps to establish an identity as well as a bridge that connects the past and today with a flexible and open attitude. In order to understand the culture of the Joseon Dynasty, classes were designed by linking the appreciation and expression areas of the art department. In particular, regarding the appreciation of Gamrodo, various media were used to make it easy for learners to access with interest and to share their feelings through discussions and discussions, and to apply them to their lives. Buddhist paintings have the advantage of establishing an identity with an understanding of our art and an open attitude through art ability to understand culture and contributing to the development of the community. Therefore, if students are interested in Buddhist paintings and have a deep appreciation, they will not only understand our culture, but also develop a culture as citizens."

Therefore, the process of removing noise must be accompanied at the pre-processing stage of the vibration signal.In this paper, instead of the signal processing filter traditionally used for noise removal, an artificial intelligence-based prediction maintenance system is proposed, which applies a dinoing model that eliminates noise of signals by using an autocoder model based on 1D-CNN, a deep learning non-instructor learning, and classifies abnormal signals and fault modes for signals with which noise has been removed."
A sparse auto-encoder method based on compressed sensing and wavelet packet energy entropy for rolling bearing intelligent fault diagnosis,2020,['· Intelligent diagnosis · Rolling bearing · Compressed sensing · Sparse auto-encoder · Wavelet packet energy entropy'],,"Improving diagnostic efficiency and shortening diagnostic time is important for improving the reliability and safety of rotating machinery, and has received more and more attention. When using intelligent diagnostic methods to diagnose bearing faults, the increasingly complex working conditions and the huge amount of data make it a great challenge to diagnose fault quickly and effectively. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis method based on sparse auto-encoder (SAE), combined with compression sensing (CS) and wavelet packet energy entropy (WPEE) for feature dimension reduction is proposed. Firstly, vibration signals of each fault type are projected linearly through compressed sensing to obtain compressed signals, which are merged into a low-dimensional compressed signal matrix of multiple fault types.Secondly, the WPEE of low-dimensional compressed signal matrix of multi-fault type is determined, and the eigenvector matrix of bearing fault diagnosis is formed, which greatly reduces the dimension of the eigenvector matrix. Finally, SAE are constructed by adding sparse penalty to auto-encoder (AE) for high-level feature learning and bearing fault classification, and it not only further learns the high-level features of data, but also reduces the feature dimension.Compared with traditional feature extraction methods and the standard deep learning method, the proposed method not only guarantees high accuracy, but also greatly reduces the diagnosis time."

Core competency-based education was adopted by the government’s financial support program for colleges. Following the ACE Project, the Ministry of Education now promotes competency-based education as a policy index upon the diagnosis of a college’s fundamental competency. But competency-based education derived from external goals has created some problems, including the use of certain slogans, catch phrases, match-ups, formalism, an ideology for blind quantitative measurement, etc. In order to improve core competency-based liberal arts education, it should first be internally justified; a 21st-century educational framework should be established by reflecting a core competency model; education and learning experiences on which Knowledge, Skills and Attitude are integrated, should be universalized, and finally; changes in the very being of a person should be pursued based on a deep understanding and mastery of the humanities.

APT 공격 탐지를 위한 공격 경로 및 의도 인지 시스템,2020,"['Advanced Persistent Threat', 'Correlation Analysis', 'Behavior Analysis', 'Trace Format', 'Intrusion Detection']",,"Typical security solutions such as intrusion detection system are not suitable for detecting advanced persistent attack(APT), because they cannot draw the big picture from trivial events of security solutions. Researches on techniques for detecting multiple stage attacks by analyzing the correlations between security events or alerts are being actively conducted in academic field. However, these studies still use events from existing security system, and there is insufficient research on the structure of the entire security system suitable for advanced persistent attacks. In this paper, we propose an attack path and intention recognition system suitable for multiple stage attacks like advanced persistent attack detection. The proposed system defines the trace format and overall structure of the system that detects APT attacks based on the correlation and behavior analysis, and is designed with a structure of detection system using deep learning and big data technology, etc."
A New Hyper Parameter of Hounsfield Unit Range in Liver Segmentation,2020,"['U-Net', 'Liver Segmentation', 'Hounsfield Unit (HU)', 'ResUNet']",,"Liver cancer is the most fatal cancer that occurs worldwide. In order to diagnose liver cancer, the patient's physical condition was checked by using a CT technique using radiation. Segmentation was needed to diagnose the liver on the patient's abdominal CT scan, which the radiologists had to do manually, which caused tremendous time and human mistakes. In order to automate, researchers attempted segmentation using image segmentation algorithms in computer vision field, but it was still time-consuming because of the interactive based and the setting value. To reduce time and to get more accurate segmentation, researchers have begun to attempt to segment the liver in CT images using CNNs, which show significant performance in various computer vision fields. The pixel value, or numerical value, of the CT image is called the Hounsfield Unit (HU) value, which is a relative representation of the transmittance of radiation, and usually ranges from about -2000 to 2000. In general, deep learning researchers reduce or limit this range and use it for training to remove noise and focus on the target organ. Here, we observed that the range of HU values was limited in many studies but different in various liver segmentation studies, and assumed that performance could vary depending on the HU range. In this paper, we propose the possibility of considering HU value range as a hyper parameter. U-Net and ResUNet were used to compare and experiment with different HU range limit preprocessing of CHAOS dataset under limited conditions. As a result, it was confirmed that the results are different depending on the HU range. This proves that the range limiting the HU value itself can be a hyper parameter, which means that there are HU ranges that can provide optimal performance for various models."

In this study, we attempted to improve speech recognition by identifying and compensating for the frequency response that changes due to the spatial characteristics of the installed chamber. To this end, a frequency response filter was calculated through a volumetric design experiment, and speech recognition improvement for filter application was confirmed by recognizing sentence-level speech in a speech to text method using a deep learning AI algorithm API.

UAV-RFID Integration for Construction Resource Localization,2020,"['Material localization', 'Unmanned aerial vehicle', 'Radio frequency identification', 'Recurrent neural network', 'Long short-term memory']",,"Location data of construction resources are important in understanding on the context of a construction site, yet most sites still rely on people’s observations to localize their resources. Among then various localization technologies, radio frequency identification (RFID) is considered as a good solution. However, RFID either provides limited location data when fixed receivers are used, or it requires considerable manpower for scanning the tagged resources when hand-held receivers are used. These requirements result in inefficiency and impractical demands on time and cost, particularly in the case of complex or large-scale sites. This study attempted to overcome the limitations by proposing an integrated unmanned aerial vehicle-RFID (UAV-RFID) platform to replace the considerable manpower with the UAV and to enable identifying tags on a site. It applies deep learning algorithms to localize an RFID tag position within an acceptable range of accuracy, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the integrated platform for construction resource localization."

However, the majority of speech recognition systems on the market are developed on data with limited diversity of speakers and tend to perform well on typical adult speakers only. This is because most of the speech recognition models are generally learned using a speech database obtained from adult males and females. This tends to cause problems in recognizing the speech of the elderly, children and people with dialects well. To solve these problems, it may be necessary to retain big database or to collect a data for applying a speaker adaptation. However, this paper proposes that a new end-to-end speech recognition method consists of an acoustic augmented recurrent encoder and a transformer decoder with linguistic prediction. The proposed method can bring about the reliable performance of acoustic and language models in limited data conditions. The proposed method was evaluated to recognize Korean elderly and children speech with limited amount of training data and showed the better performance compared of a conventional method."

For this reason, import reports are consigned to customs officials, who are customs experts, while paying a substantial fee. The purpose of this study is to classify HS items to be reported upon import declaration and to indicate HS codes to be recorded on import declaration. HS items were classified using the attached image in the case of item classification based on the case of the classification of items by the Korea Customs Service for classification of HS items. For image classification, CNN was used as a deep learning algorithm commonly used for image recognition and Vgg16, Vgg19, ResNet50 and Inception-V3 models were used among CNN models. To improve classification accuracy, two datasets were created. Dataset1 selected five types with the most HS code images, and Dataset2 was tested by dividing them into five types with 87 Chapter, the most among HS code 2 units. The classification accuracy was highest when HS item classification was performed by learning with dual database2, the corresponding model was Inception-V3, and the ResNet50 had the lowest classification accuracy. The study identified the possibility of HS item classification based on the first item image registered in the item classification determination case, and the second point of this study is that HS item classification, which has not been attempted before, was attempted through the CNN model."

"인공지능 창작물의 저작물성에 관한 중국 판례 검토 - 페이린, 드림라이터 사건을 중심으로 -",2020,"['인공지능', '인공지능 창작물', '저작권법', '권리 주체', '보호 요건', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence Creation', 'Copyright Law', 'Subject of Rights', 'Protection Requirement']","인공지능이 처음 등장하였을 때는 창작물을 만들기 위한 하나 의 도구로 활용되는 것에 불과하였다. 그러나 지금은 딥러닝, 머신러닝 방식을 통해 인공지능이 대량의 정보를 인식해 스스 로 분석하고 학습함으로써 인간의 추가적 명령 없이도 스스로 창작물을 완성할 수 있는 단계에 도달할 정도로 발전하였다. 따 라서 인공지능이 창작한 창작물에 대한 법적 대응을 어떻게 할 것인지에 대해 국가마다 논의가 활발하다. 최근 중국 법원에서 인공지능이 창작한 창작물에 대한 2건의 법원 판결이 있었으며 1건은 최종심까지 내려졌다. 인공지능이 창작한 창작물에 대한 저작권 침해 소송에 대해 법원이 판결하 였다는 점에서 큰 의미가 있다. 따라서, 본 논문은 인공지능 창 작물에 대한 중국 법원 판결인 페이린 사건과 드림라이터 사건 을 중심으로 관련 판례를 소개하고, 중국 저작권법상 저작물의 성립 요건 및 저작자 지위에 관한 법적 검토를 통해 인공지능 창작물에 대한 중국의 태도를 살펴보았다. 2건의 판례에 등장한 인공지능은 약한 인공지능 단계로 최종 결과물이 생성될 때 인간의 참여가 들어간다는 것을 전제로 중 국 법원은 인공지능 창작물의 주체성은 부정하고, 법인 저작물 로써 창작물의 저작물성을 긍정하였다. 그러나 강한 인공지능이 등장할 경우 지금의 중국 법원 판결만으로는 여전히 그 답을 내릴 수는 없다. 저작권법상 인공지능 창작물에 대한 검토가 어 렵다면 오히려 부정경쟁방지법의 보호 대상이 계속 확대되고 있는 상황에서 부정경쟁행위 유형의 하나인 ‘상당한 투자나 노 력으로 만들어진 성과’로 접근하여 인공지능 창작물에 대한 해 결 방법도 고민할 수 있지 않을까 생각한다.","When artificial intelligence first appeared, it was only used as a tool to create creations. But now, artificial intelligence has become so advanced without additional human commands through deep learning and machine learning that it can recognize a large amount of information, analyze and learn on its own. Therefore, there are active discussions among countries on how to take legal action against creations created by artificial intelligence. There have been two recent court cases in Chinese courts on creations created by artificial intelligence. One of them had a final decision. It is significant in that the court ruled against a copyright infringement lawsuit against a creation created by artificial intelligence. Therefore, this paper introduces relevant precedents focusing on the Feilin case and Dreamwriter case, which are Chinese court cases on artificial intelligence creations. We examined China's attitude toward artificial intelligence creations through a legal review of the requirements for the establishment of works and the status of authors under the Chinese Copyright Law. AI, which appeared in the two cases, was an weak artificial intelligence stage, based on the assumption that human participation was involved when the final results were produced. The Chinese court denied the identity of the artificial intelligence creation, but recognized it as a work. However, if strong artificial intelligence appears, the current Chinese court cases alone will still not give the answer. If it is difficult to review artificial intelligence creations under the copyright law, the solution to artificial intelligence creations should also be considered in terms of performance made with considerable investment or effort one of the types of anti-unfair competition action."

Ahn et al. and K. Han et al.present the evaluation of atmospheric profile retrieval algorithm and NDVI estimation for GK2A satellite, respectively.K. Han et al. documents the improvement of 6S look-up-table based surface reflectance employing minimum curvature surface method. S. Hong and K. Lee et al. present the infrared soil moisture and upward longwave radiation retrieval algorithms for GK2A satellite, respectively. K. Min et al. present the improvement of the rapid-development thunderstorm algorithm for GK2A satellite.National Meteorological Satellite Center (NMSC) of Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) has been operating the first Korean geostationary meteorological Satellite, named of Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) since 27 June 2010 and retired it in March 2020.During its almost 10 years of successful career, COMS has operationally provided the 16 derived products which have used for the monitoring of severe weather phenomena including tropical storms, deep convective clouds, fronts, fog, aerosols such as Asian dust and utilizations in the numerical weather predictions models. In order to continue satellite observations for the follow on mission of COMS, NMSC started the second geostationary meteorological satellite project in 2011, so-called GK2A and its ground segment projects in collaboration with Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) and Korea Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI). After successful launch on 5 December 2018 and in orbit test lasted about 8 months, the GK2A is commissioned since 25 July 2019 with the Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) of 16-channel imager like the Japanese Himawari-8 and the United States GOES-16 satellites launched in 2014 and 2016, respectively.GK2A AMI can produce high spatio-temporal measurements with 0.5 ~ 2 km resolutions every 2 min around Korean Peninsula and 10 min for full disk area. To maximize the application of these rapid observational data for weather and climate monitoring, NMSC has led to develop retrieval algorithms of the value added products in cooperation with universities in Korea as well as the support from the internationally distinguished experts of satellite meteorology. From experiences learned in COMS operations, we focused the applications as well as the accuracy in the algorithm development to help satellite data interpreters, weather forecasters, typhoon forecasters and the users of satellite data in many other areas. NMSC continues to share and improve the GK2A algorithms in collaboration with other research groups and satellite centers for uses widely and the preparation of the follow-on meteorological satellite.We hope that the papers in this issue will encourage further improvement of the GK2A meteorological retrieval algorithms and promote the scientific knowledges and capability in meteorological satellite studies."

The laser active thermography system observes thermal wave concentrations in the crack while exciting the surface of the weld. The crack detection algorithm (1) visualizes the cracks by merging the infrared (IR) images using the temperature distribution characteristics; (2) employs input image generation with a specific method to prevent overfitting; (3) analyzes and classifies the characteristics of the cracks using a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN); and (4) marks the location of the cracks in the original IR image. The system and algorithm were verified using two SUS specimens (#1 and #2) and compared with actual crack data obtained by microscopy and penetration test. The CNN was trained with 618 images of cracks and 1834 images of intact specimen #1. For performance verification, a total of nine areas of specimens #1 and #2 were divided into 300 test images; 13 out of 14 cracks were detected while four intact images were overdetected. Thus, the developed algorithm can detect cracks in welded surfaces by distinuishing them from complex patterns of welding."
‘두 형제’ 이야기의 원형과 현대적 변용,2020,"['쌍둥이', '두 형제', '이항대립. 그림자', '내적 통합', 'The Twin', 'Two Brothers', 'Binary Opposition', 'Shadow', 'Inner Cooperation']","‘두 형제(Two Brothers)’ 이야기는 아르네-톰슨에 의해 유형 303으로 분류된 바 있다. 두 형제의 경쟁과 협동을 담은 이러한 ‘형제 서사’ 유형은 형제 대신 자매, 남매, 유사 형제, 친구 등의 관계로 변용될 수도 있다. ‘두 형제’ 이야기의 기본은 형제 사이의 경쟁담이다. 신화와 민담에서는 형제/자매의 경쟁담, 남매의 결혼담 등이 원형으로 남아 있는데. 이집트 신화 속의 이시스/오시리스, 제주도 설화 속의 대별왕/소별왕, 일본 신화 속의 이자나기/이자나미, 성경 속의 카인과 아벨, 야곱과 에서, 탕자의 비유 등에서 광범위하게 확인된다. 여기에는 경쟁이라는 요소 외에도 살인, 질투, 근친상간, 거짓말 등의 부정적인 요소들도 자주 등장한다. 또 하나의 패턴은 형제 사이의 협력담이다. 형제들은 공통의 목표를 두고 협력하는 관계에 놓이는데, 처음에는 경쟁 관계에 있다가 점차 이해와 공존, 보완의 관계에 도달한다. 서정주의 시 ｢남백월이성｣는 친형제의 이야기가 아니라 유사 형제의 이야기를 다루고 있는데, 이 시에서 두 스님은 성불(成佛)을 목표로 경쟁하는 관계에서 출발하나, 점차 큰 깨달음으로 향하는 존재로 변하게 된다. 셋째 패턴은 그야말로 ‘쌍둥이’를 다룬 텍스트에서 발견된다. 쌍둥이 모티브는 한 인격에 내재된 모순된 두 측면의 충돌, 카를 융의 용어에 의하면 두 대립적 심리유형 사이의 상보성을 가장 전형적으로 드러내는 사례에 해당한다. 영화 <아이언마스크>와 <광해, 왕이 된 남자>는 현실에 존재하는 왕 뒤에 이를 대체할 수 있는 쌍둥이, 즉 ‘상보성’으로서의 왕이 존재한다는 가설에서 출발하고 있다. 이들 숨겨진 왕은 현실에 존재하는 왕의 대립적인 인격을 대표하고 있으며, 왕의 결점을 보완할 수 있는 가능성으로 제시된다. 형이 착하고 동생이 영악하다는 설정은 대부분의 이야기에서 일반적으로 나타나는데, 놀부/흥부, 대별왕/소별왕, 이시스/세트, 토르/로키 등의 형상에서 확인된다. 그러나 형제 싸움은 과거(보수, 안정)와 미래(진보, 모험)의 싸움, 혹은 의존하려는 경향과 자립하려는 경향 사이의 갈등을 의미하기도 한다. 이 외에도 옛이야기에서는 바보/현자, 남성/여성, 선/악, 이성/감성 등의 이항대립이 발견되는데, 결국 이항대립에 근거한 ‘두 형제’ 이야기는 서로 상반되는 인격의 두 측면이 내적 통합에 이르는 과정을 형상화한 것이라 볼 수 있다.","Anti Aarne and Stith Thomson have classified story types of ‘The Twin or blood brothers’ as Type No.303. “The Twin or blood brothers” can be transformed into different relations: Two Sisters, Two Siblings, Two Pseudo Brothers, Two Friends. The basic story of “Two Brothers” is based on the contest between the two. In myths and folk tales, the competition between brother and sister remains in their original form. These stories are Isis/Osiris in Egyptian mythology, Big Star King(대별왕)/Small Star King(소별왕) in the folk tales of Jeju Island, Izanagi/Izanami in Japanese mythology, Cain/Abel in the Holy Bible. In these stories, we can find negative feelings such as murder, jealousy, incest and lies besides competitions. The second pattern of “Two Brothers” is based on the cooperation between the two. Two brothers cooperate each other for a common goal. They are in competition at first, but gradually understand the other brother and help him. The poet <Two Saints at Southern White Moon Mountain(남백월이성)> written by Seo Jeong-ju(서정주) tells the competition between two friends who wish to be the Buddha through the hard mental discipline at Southern White Moon Mountain. At first, they intended to be a Buddha by winning the other rival friend. But they learn to know that the best way to be a Buddha is to help each other. The third pattern of “Two Brothers” can be found at the stories of the ‘twin’. They resemble each other in appearance but are different in the own characters. Karl Gustav Jung defined the psychological types of human mind. Of course, they have their own “shadow” in their deep level minds. Sometimes twin brothers can have the opposite characters. The heroes of both movies in <The Iron Mask(아이언마스크> and <Masquerade(광해, 왕이 된 남자)> are twin kings. In those movies, one is real a King, and the other is a pseudo King. The half of the real King’s characters which are suppressed can be represented at the other characters of twin brothers. The twin personalities can be the supplement each other. It is the universal law that the elder brother is good and younger is evil in the folk tales: Nolbu(놀부)/Heungbu(흥부), Big Star King(대별왕)/Small Star King(소별왕) Isis/Seth, Thor/Loki. According to Bettelheim’s theory, Sibling rivalry such as jealousy, competition, fighting between siblings are based on the struggle between past(conservative-, stable-) and future(progressive-, adventurous-). The additional opposed features such as fool/clever, male/female, good/evil, thinking/felling which are found at the type of “The Twin and Blood Brothers” mean that the narrow “Ego” can be cooperated into the “Whole Self” in the process of their lives."

The location data of 193 pine wilt disease trees were constructed through field surveys and vegetation index analyses of NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE and SAVI were performed using multi-spectral UAV images at the same time. K-Means algorithm was adopted to classify damaged trees and confusion matrix was used to compare and analyze the classification accuracy. The results of the study are summarized as follows. First, the overall accuracy of the classification was analyzed in order of NDVI (88.04%, Kappa coefficient 0.76) > GNDVI (86.01%, Kappa coefficient 0.72) > NDRE (77.35%, Kappa coefficient 0.55) > SAVI (76.84%, Kappa coefficient 0.54) and showed the highest accuracy of NDVI. Second, K-Means unsupervised classification method using NDVI or GNDVI is possible to some extent to find out the damaged trees. In particular, this technique is to help early detection of damaged trees due to its intensive operation, low user intervention and relatively simple analysis process. In the future, it is expected that the utilization of time series images or the application of deep learning techniques will increase the accuracy of classification."

Accordingly, the number of contents in circulation is increasing, while the number of distributing illegal copies that infringe on copyright is also increasing. The Korea Copyright Protection Agency operates a illegal content obstruction program based on substring matching, and it is difficult to accurately search because a large number of noises are inserted to bypass this. Recently, researches using natural language processing and AI deep learning technologies to remove noise and various blockchain technologies for copyright protection are being studied, but there are limitations. In this paper, noise is removed from data collected online, and keyword-based illegal copies are searched. In addition, the same heavy uploader is estimated through profiling analysis for heavy uploaders. In the future, it is expected that copyright damage will be minimized if the illegal copy search technology and blocking and response technology are combined based on the results of profiling analysis for heavy uploaders."

인공지능이 인간 같은 행위자가 될 수 있나?,2020,"['인공지능', '인간 지능', '진정성', '행위자', '정체성', '자의식', 'artificial intelligence', 'human intelligence', 'authenticity', 'agent', 'identity', 'self-awareness']","이 글은 인공지능과 인간 지능의 차이가 무엇인지 논의함으로써 인공지능의 존재론적 지위와 인간의 특징이 무엇인지 밝히고자 한다. 최근 알파고의 등장에서처럼 인공지능은 컴퓨터가 상호 연계되며 빅 데이터 기술과 딥 러닝 기술까지 포함하는 형태로 발전하였고 계산의 영역뿐만 아니라 감성의 영역까지 포함하는 것으로 발전하고 있다. 그러나 인공지능은 인간의 감성을 흉내낼 뿐이다. 왜냐하면 감정이나 정서의 영역은 진정성이 중요하게 작동하는 영역으로서 감정을 표출하는 자의 주체성과 총체적 인격성이 전제되어야 하기 때문이다. 또한 인간의 뇌가 수행한 기능은 생존을 위한 것이다. 지능 역시 생존을 위한 문제해결능력으로 정의될 수 있다. 이런 점에서 인공지능은 진정한 지능이라 여길 수 없다. 인공지능이 인간과 같은 진정한 지능을 갖추기 위해서는 인공지능이 자신이 처한 환경에서 생존하려는 문제해결능력의 발휘로서 지능을 사용해야 하기 때문이다. 그러나 인공지능이 생존하려는 욕구를 지니고 있다고 판단하기는 아직 이르다. 게다가 인공지능이 인간과 같은 자의식이라는 고도의 지능을 지니고 있다거나 지닐 것이라고 보기도 어렵다. 인간의 자의식은 생물체로서의 유한성을 인식하고 다른 인간과의 연대와 협력을 통해 자아정체성과 함께 타자성을 인식하는 매우 고차원적인 지능 활동이다. 이와 같이 인간 지능과 인공지능의 차이는 인공지능이 의도를 지닌 행위자로 인식되기 어렵다는 판단에 이르게 하며, 도덕적 행위자로 인식되기는 더욱 어렵다고 본다. 인공지능을 인간처럼 여기는 태도나 기획은 오히려 인간이 인공지능과 어떻게 다른지를 보여주고 있다.","This paper aims to clarify the ontological status of artificial intelligence and features of human intelligence by dealing with the difference between them. Recently, as AlphaGo shows, artificial intelligence has the network of computers and adopts deep learning technology with big data. Further, artificial intelligence is introduced to the scope of emotion as well as to that of calculation. However, artificial intelligence just imitates human emotion because subjectivity and holistic personality of emotion exposer must be presupposed and because emotion plays a role with authenticity. the function of human brain is to make a human being survive. Human intelligence can be defined as a problem-solving capacity for survival. Thus, artificial intelligence is not the same as human intelligence. In order for artificial intelligence to be an human intelligence, it uses its intelligence for its problem-solving for survival. But it is hard to say that artificial intelligence has a desire to survive. In addition, it is also hard to say that artificial intelligence has or will have self-awareness like human being’s. Human self-awareness is a very high level of intelligence activity in which a human being recognizes one’s finitude as a biological organism and one’s self identity as well as otherness through the cooperation with others. The difference between artificial intelligence and human one leads us to think that an artificial intelligence cannot become an agent with intention and not even moral agent. The attitude or project to consider artificial intelligence to be an human intelligence is only to show that there are big differences between them."
Development of a Humanoid Robot for the 2018 Ski Robot Challenge,2020,['Ski · Robot · Humanoid · Challenge'],,"We describe in this paper, the development of a humanoid robot for the 2018 Ski Robot Challenge, which was held in Korea. The goal of this competition was to develop a humanoid robot that could autonomously perform in a ski giant slalom game. To participate in this competition, we developed the humanoid robot RoK-2 which is designed to ski on a slope. The lower body joints of the robot were developed to have high torque because it needed to perform ski motions in a situation where shock and vibration would occur. The upper body of the robot was designed to be shielded from factors that could damage electronic components such as snow. The ski robot required a ski turning mechanism so that it could make its way between the ski flags on the slope. To perform the turns accurately, a ski plate for the desired radius was selected and the robot performed a proper, humanlike motion using the extension–flexion a motion of carved turn. To verify the stability of the motion, we confirmed that the zero-moment point (ZMP) of the robot was within a support polygon of the robot. The environment of a ski slope is not good for image processing because of the changing light and weather. To overcome this problem, a deep learning based ski flag recognition algorithm was developed so that the robot could recognize ski flags correctly. Finally, RoK-2 was verified in the 2018 Ski Robot Challenge."

Korean criminal justice system is basically centered around humans. Yet, the discussion over whether medical artificial intelligence can be granted legal personality or not can lead to a different conclusion.‘Weak artificial intelligence’ that is being realized nowadays and ‘strong artificial intelligence’ that hasn’t been realized yet must be separated to investigate the discussion. Moreover, the responsibilities for those involved in the process of the use of artificial intelligence have to be examined, too. Likewise, the matter of responsibility for the medical practices by medical artificial intelligence should be subdivided and analyzed centered around the people involved in the application process of artificial intelligence. The occurrence of malpractices or medical accidents in the process of a medical practioner’s using medical artificial intelligence, or the occurrence of an error in the process of the initial setting of medical artificial intelligence can be the examples.Moreover, it needs to be investigated what roles Watson, the medical artificial intelligence in use currently, is playing in the medical area. That is, Watson now learns a great deal of medical information and data, and based on that, recommends not only appropriate treatments but also desirable remedies divided into three stages. The problem that these actions can be seen as a doctor’s medical decision making or medical practices can be raised. In addition, there is still controversy over whether artificial intelligence has the ability to act and to take responsibility or not, so it requires close examination."

Mangong Wolmyeon's Seon-education for bhikkhunis and its significance, he laid a cornerstone of the Korean tradition of Ganhwaseon.Ven. Mangong asked for the bhikkhuni Seon practitioners to keep their tiger-like eyes[虎示見] seeing through the truth of that period. His supervision was given from time to time in a form of Dhamma Debate(擧揚) which was a kind of active discussion about Dhamma between the master and the practitioners. He grafted onto the Ganhwaseon discipline three elements of Great Faith(大信心: deep belief in the truth), Great Indignation(大憤心: indignation for oneself who can’t attain mastery) and Great Doubt(大疑心: deep question for disciplines). In other words, he passed down the spirit of Great Doubt & Enlightenment. He was longing for the bhikkhunis to keep the tradition of Seon practice and to succeed the identity of Joseon Buddhism as integrity of national value. That was the reason why he handed down the poetic writings & praising to the bhikkhunis which stimulated their devotion of learning, and inquired them into the development of Seon practice.On the other hand their Spirit succeeded the right disciplines and wisdom of Buddha, they rejected the Japanese style buddhism or Japanese colonialism against the Joseon Buddhism, which became integrated the Spirit of the Times.Like this, Ven. Mangong had shown the real attitude of Seon meditation by overcoming the hell in mind and by setting up the heaven in mind. In order that the Mind Heaven[唯心淨土] may turn into the Real Paradise[現實極樂], Ven. Mangong was the very master of high virtue of Korean Buddhism who implanted philosophical and religious spirit of the Times for all the registered Bhikkhus & Bhikkhunis."

At the present time, almost all of rainwater pumping stations employ pumping policies based on the simple rules depending only on the water level of reservoir. The ongoing climate change caused by global warming makes it increasingly difficult to predict the amount of rainfall. Therefore, it is difficult to cope with changes in the water level of reservoirs through the simple pumping policy. In this paper, we propose a pump operating method based on deep reinforcement learning which has the ability to select the appropriate number of operating pumps to keep the reservoir to the proper water level using the information of the amount of rainfall, the water volume and current water level of the reservoir. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the simulations are performed using Storm Water Management Model(SWMM), a dynamic rainfall-runoff-routing simulation model, and the performance of the method is compared with that of a pumping policy being in use in the field."
Understanding tourists’ urban images with geotagged photos using convolutional neural networks,2020,['Image data mining Geotagged photos Flickr Convolutional neural network Inception v3 model'],,"This study aims to track down representative images and elements of sightseeing attractions by analyzing the photos uploaded on Flickr by Seoul tourists with the image mining technique. For this purpose, we crawled the photos uploaded on Flickr and classified users into residents and tourists; drew 11 region of attractions (RoA) in Seoul by analyzing the spatial density of the photos; classified the photos into 1000 categories and then 14 categories by grouping 1000 categories by utilizing Inception V3 model; analyzed the characteristics of the photo image by RoA. Key findings of this study are that tourists are interested in old palaces, historical monuments, stores, food, etc. and those key elements are distinguished from the major sightseeing attractions in Seoul. More specifi- cally, tourists are more interested in palaces and cultural assets in Jongno and Namsan, food and restaurants in Shinchon, Hongdae, Itaewon, Yeouido, Garosu-gil, and Apgujeong, war monuments or specific artifacts in War Memorial and the National Museum of Korea, facilities, temples, and pictures of cultural properties in Samsung Station, and toyshops in Jamsil. This study is meaningful in three folds: first, it tries to analyze urban image through the photos posted on SNS by tourists. Second, it uses deep learning technique to analyze the photos. Third, it classifies and analyzes the whole photos posted by Seoul tourists while most of other researches focus on only specific objects. However, this study has a limitation because the Inception v3 model which has been used in this research is a pre-trained model created by training the ImageNet data.In future research, it is necessary to classify photo categories according to the purpose of tourism and retrain the model by creating new training data set focusing on elements of Korea."
A Study on Self-medication for Health Promotion of the Silver Generation,2020,"['Silver generation', 'Social media', 'Health app', 'Health promotion', 'Self medication']",,"With the development of medical care in the 21st century and the rapid development of the 4th industry, electronic devices and household goods taking into account the physical and mental aging of the silver generation have been developed, and apps related to health and health are generally developed and operated. The apps currently used by the silver generation are a form that provides information on diseases by focusing on prevention rather than treatment, such as safety management apps for the elderly living alone and methods for preventing diseases. There are not many apps that provide information on foods that have a direct effect and nutrients in that food, and research on apps that can obtain information about individual foods is insufficient. In this paper, we propose an app that analyzes food factors and provides self-medication for health promotion of the silver generation. This app allows the silver generation to conveniently and easily obtain information such as nutrients, calories, and efficacy of food they need. In addition, this app collects/categorizes healthy food information through a textom solution-based crawling agent, and stores highly relevant words in a data resource. In addition, wide deep learning was applied to enable self-medication recommendations for food. When this technique is applied, the most appropriate healthy food is suggested to people with similar eating patterns and tastes in the same age group, and users can receive recommendations on customized healthy foods that they need before eating. This made it possible to obtain convenient healthy food information through a customized interface for the elderly through a smartphone."

There is a growing need for automated surveillance systems to replace soldiers in the field of military surveillance operations. Even though the object detection technology is developing rapidly in the civilian domain, but the research applied to the military is insufficient due to a lack of data and interest. Thus, in this paper, we applied one of deep learning algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network-based binary classification to develop an autonomous identification model of both friend and foe helicopters (AH-64, Mi-17) among the military weapon systems, and evaluated the model performance by considering accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure. As the result, the identification model demonstrates 97.8%, 97.3%, 98.5%, and 97.8 for accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure, respectively. In addition, we analyzed the feature map on convolution layers of the identification model in order to check which area of imagery is highly weighted. In general, rotary shaft of rotating wing, wheels, and air-intake on both of ally and foe helicopters played a major role in the performance of the identification model. This is the first study to attempt to classify images of helicopters among military weapons systems using CNN, and the model proposed in this study shows higher accuracy than the existing classification model for other weapons systems."

Kim Si-seup's “Yisaeng peeks inside the fence” and Park Wan-seo's “Her House” are the objects of comparison.With the 14th and 20th centuries as temporal backgrounds, respectively, the male and female protagonists of these two novels, namely, Yisaeng and Lady Choi, and Man-deuk and Gopdan, each have a good appearance, intelligent, and literary taste. They lived in the same village and were regarded as precious as beautiful and ideal young men and women who could represent the village, and they naturally came close to the support and blessings of their families and villagers. The familiar commute road where two male protagonists of student status came and went with books on their sides became a place where they met their lover and made love. The place, beyond the 500-year gap in the time when each novel was created, has a spatial congruence point of Gaeseong in North Korea. In short, the two pairs of young men and women, and the family and community who loved them, are all Gaeseong people. The happy love of these two pairs of young men and women shone brightly only for a short period of time, and a long and dark farewell followed forever. The two female protagonists suffered a terrible death or a sacrifice equal to death in the process of avoiding sexual violence against women accompanying war and foreign invasion. And the two male protagonists were left in the world with their loved ones forever lost, but in the end they kept that person in mind. Despite the gap of more than 500 years in terms of creation period, these two Korean novels have such a great deal in common. In this respect, the learner can understand the character's inner psychology more specifically. Moreover, the learners who are residents of the Korean peninsula can advance to deep thoughts on the issue of peace and reunification of Korea."
왕수인의 감정론과 슈타이너의 12감각론 비교 고찰,2020,"['왕수인', '루돌프 슈타이너', '양지', '감정', '감각', '중화', 'Wang Shou-Ren', 'Rudolf Steiner', 'Liang-chich', 'Emotion', 'Sense', 'Neutralization']","이 논문의 목적은 왕수인(王守仁, 1472~1528)의 감정론과 루돌프 슈타이너(Rudolf Steiner, 1861~1925)의 12감각론을 비교하여, 인간이 주체적 체험을 기반으로 성숙해지고 발전해가는 과정을 고찰하고자 한다.왕수인의 감정론은 성리학에서와 달리 성(性)과 심(心)을 분리해서 이해했던 바를 통합하여 단일한 범주를 만들었고, 도덕성을 실현하는 데 있어서 도덕 감정과 도덕 심리를 동일한 맥락으로 이해하도록 기초를 만들었다. 이것은 감정과 욕구의 부분을 양지론(良知論)의 본류로 개입시켰다. 우선, 양지를 실현하겠다는 의지를 내고, 자신 앞에 주어진 일상의 사태(事態) 속에서 자신의 감정과 욕구를 관조하며 중절을 지키고, 중절을 지킨 마음으로 조리에 맞게 바른 실천을 해나간다. 또한, 스스로 양지를 실현했을 때 갖는 자겸(自慊)과 진실한 즐거움[眞樂]을 통한 체득은 궁극적으로는 만물일체(萬物一體)로 이어져 도덕적 실천에 대한 자각으로 이어진다.슈타이너의 감각론은 기존의 오감과는 다른 12감각을 제안한다. 그가 인간을 12가지 감각으로 분류한 것은 인간 존재의 깊은 이해에 기반한 것이며, 슈타이너의 인지학(人智學)적 세계관이 깊이 반영되어 나타난 것이다. 슈타이너의 감각론은 신체ㆍ영혼ㆍ정신의 통합체로서 인간을 이해하며, 통합체의 구성에 맞게 네 가지씩 의지[몸]감각, 감정[혼]감각, 정신[영]감각으로 총 12감각을 이루고 있다. 감각의 발달은 주기적 발전이 이루어져 그에 맞춰 자신의 육체에 대한 내부영역의 의지감각, 나 이외의 사람과의 관계에 대한 관계영역의 감정감각, 자신의 내면 혹은 고차적 존재와 연관된 고차영역의 정신감각에 맞춰 발전해가는 것으로 이해할 수 있다.왕수인과 슈타이너가 추구하는 인간상(人間像)은 영성을 겸비한 전인적 인간으로 이 세계에 대한 책임을 느끼는 인간이다. 두 사상가의 인간이 성숙해지는 과정은 다음과 같은 순서를 통해 맥락적으로 비교할 수 있다. 첫째 왕수인의 성인(聖人)이 되겠다는 의지를 내는 것과 슈타이너의 내부영역인 몸감각을 통하여 의지를 나타내는 주체인 나를 알아가는 것, 둘째 왕수인의 감정 중절을 이루며 그것을 바탕으로 타자와 주어진 사태를 통해 바른 선택을 하며 양지를 지극하게 실현하는 것과 슈타이너의 또 다른 ‘나’들과의 관계를 맺으며 자신의 감정을 경험하여 깨쳐가는 것, 셋째 왕수인의 양지 실현이 지속적으로 이루어지기 위해 자겸과 진락과 만물일체의 자각을 통해 도덕적 실천력을 갖는 것과 슈타이너의 고차적인 외부와의 관계를 맺으며 자신의 내면과 감응하여 이 세계에 대한 책임감을 가지고 실천하는 것이다.감정론과 감각론의 비교를 통한 고찰은 동양과 서양이라는 공간적 조건과 시대적 조건을 초월하는 비교 대상을 통해 현대 사회에 객관적으로 적용이 가능한 인간 이해를 살펴볼 수 있으며, 더불어 바람직한 인간상을 제시한다.","The purpose of this study is to comparatively study the emotional theory of Wang Shou-Ren and the twelve sense theory of Rudolf Steiner. The emotional theory of Wang Shou-Ren proposes a methodology for understanding the process of reaching ‘Chi-liang-chich’ which is the essence of the Yangming doctrines, and the twelve sense theory serves as the basis of anthroposophy underlying the Waldorf education which is carried out in the world. The two thoughts are both founded on the human understanding which matures and develops from autonomous experiences.The emotional theory of Wang Shou-Ren created a single category by integrating the understanding of emotion which separated nature and mind, unlike the previous Neo-Confucianism, and formed the basis to help understand moral emotion and moral psychology in the same context for realizing morality. This made the area of emotion and desire intervene in the mainstream of Liang-chich theory. First, one summons the will to realize Liang-chich and keeps appropriateness while contemplating the emotion and desire of oneself in the everyday situations that are put before oneself, and logically conducts proper practice with one’s mind that is keeping the appropriateness of emotion. Moreover, the mastery achieved through self-contentment and true joy obtained when realizing Liang-chich by oneself ultimately leads to being in unity with all things, which then leads to the self-awareness towards moral practice.The sense theory of Steiner proposes twelve senses that are different from the extant five senses. His classification of the human into twelve senses is rooted in a profound understanding of human beings and emerged with a deep reflection of his anthroposophical world view. The sense theory of Steiner understands the human as an integrated entity of body, soul, and mind. It consists of twelve senses in total with four kinds for each sense of will [body], emotion [soul], and mind [spirit], according to the composition of the integrated entity. It understands that the development of senses have periodic growth, and the senses of will of the internal domain of the physical body of oneself, emotional senses of relational domain on relationships with a person other than oneself, and the mental senses of higher domain related to the inner self or a higher existence, develop in accordance with that.The human image pursued by Wang Shou-Ren and Steiner is that of a well-rounded human with both spirituality and character, who takes responsibility for this world. The maturing process of the human of both thinkers can be compared in context through the following order: first, summoning the will to become such a human [聖人, saint] of Wang Shou-Ren and learning about oneself who is the principal agent summoning the will through the bodily sense that is the internal domain; second, achieving the appropriateness of emotion of Wang Shou-Ren and making proper choices based on that through the given situations involving other people, thereby realizing Liang-chich fully, and forming relationships with other ‘selves’ of Steiner to experience emotions of oneself and being enlightened; third, acquiring moral action by being in unity with all things through self-contentment and true joy in order to continuously accomplish the Liang-chich realization of Wang Shou-Ren, and establishing relations with the higher external of Steiner to be moved by the inner self, thereby having and practicing a sense of responsibility for this world.The study comparing emotional theory and sense theory allows an examination of the human understanding that can be objectively applied to modern society through the comparison subjects transcending the spatial and periodic conditions of the East and the West, and furthermore, will be able to suggest a desirable human image."
이육사 시의 서정과 온유돈후(溫柔敦厚),2020,"['이육사', '서정', '온유돈후', '이상적 공간', '理 사상', 'Lee Yuk-sa', 'lyricism', 'Onyudonhu', 'ideal space', 'Li idea']","시의 생명력은 시인을 떠나면 철저하게 독자의 영역이라 할 수 있다. 독자는 다양한 상상력과 정서를 불러일으켜 새로운 생명으로 탄생시키기도 한다. 물론 독자들에 의해 생명을 얻지 못하거나 빛이 꺼져버린 작품들도 많다. 시대를 초월하여 시가 꾸준한 생명력을 유지하기 위해서는 ‘최고의 선(善)’이라고 일컫는 미적 가치를 지니고 있어야 한다. 그 미적 가치는 시․공간을 초월하여 보편성을 지닌다. 한국의 대표적인 시인으로 이육사의 시를 꼽을 수 있다. 그에 대한 작가와 작품 연구는 해방 이후부터 지금까지도 꾸준하게 진행되어 왔다. 그만큼 그의 시가 학술적 가치뿐만 아니라 예술적 가치 또한 높다는 증거일 것이다.  이육사는 출생에서 죽음에 이르기까지 암흑의 시기와 같이 했다. 한국이 일제의 식민 지배가 시작되기 전인 1904년에 태어나 일제의 탄압이 절정에 달한 1944년에 생을 마감한다. 비록 짧은 생애였지만 그는 시인이면서 독립운동가, 사회주의 사상가, 아나키스트, 번역가, 시사평론가 등 다방면에 활동을 펼친 인물이다. 나라의 독립을 위해 몸을 아끼지 않았고, 문학을 통해서도 끊임없이 독립 의지를 불태웠다. 그런 배경 뒤에는 부모로부터 물려받은 유가적 환경과 어릴 적부터 몸에 밴 유학자적 사상의 영향이 크다고 할 수 있다. 이육사는 퇴계 이황의 14대손이며 유림의 요람에 해당하는 안동 원촌에서 태어나 조부로부터 한학을 익히며 유년기를 보냈다. 그는 전쟁으로 인해 주권을 빼앗긴 슬픔과 인간성 상실로 인한 문제를 유가적 사유를 통해 통찰하고자 했다. 그의 시적 삶의 인식과 가치관 역시 유년기부터 이어져 온 유학적 가풍과 학문의 연장선상에 놓인 결과라고 볼 수 있다. 자신이 속한 자연환경과 생활환경은 작가의 정체성과도 분리될 수 없는 관계속성을 가진다고 볼 수 있다.  시는 최대한 감정을 절제하고 시어를 함축하는 문학이다. 육사는 시에서 암울한 현실을 그대로 드러내기보다는 대부분 비유와 상징적인 이미지를 차용했다. 또한 이미지를 진술하는 방식에서도 최대한 감정을 절제함으로써 깊은 사유와 통찰의 시선을 느끼게 하였다. 이는 시 전반에 드러난 서정적 심상과 온유돈후한 내용에 있다고 볼 수 있다. 퇴계는 진실하고 맑은 소리로 선(善)을 이끌어내는 것을 온유돈후(溫柔敦厚)라 하였다. 이육사는 극한 상황에서 불의에 맞서는 문학으로 서정과 온유돈후를 통한 유가적 세계를 지향한다. 따라서 본고에서는 이육사의 시정신의 바탕이 되었던 유학적 가풍과 유가적 사상이 그의 시에 어떻게 반영되어 있는지 살펴보고자 한다. 이를 통해 이육사 시의 한 특징으로서 서정과 온유돈후를 바탕으로 새로운 시각으로 그의 시를 살펴보는 계기가 될 것으로 생각한다.","The life force of a poem is under the full influence of readers once it leaves the poet. Some poems sometimes get new life as they stir v arious imaginations and emotions. Many others never get new life or fade away in their brightness. Poems should have aesthetic value called ""the highest good"" in order to maintain their life force consistently. The aesthetic value of poems holds everlasting significance beyond time and space. Lee Yuk-sa is one of the greatest poets in Korea. There have been ongoing researches on theories about the poet as an author and his works since the liberation of Korea, which demonstrates that his works hold high artistic value as well as academic research value.  Lee""s life matched the dark period of Korea from his birth to death. He was born in 1904 before Korea became a colony of Japan and passed away in 1944 when the Japanese suppression on Korea reached a peak. Even though his life was short, he was active across many different fields as an independence activist, socialist thinker, anarchist, translator, and commentator as well as poet. He devoted himself to the independence of the motherland and continuously consolidated his will for the independence of the country through his literature. Lee Yuksa was born in Wonchon, Andong, the cradle of Yurim. as the 14th-generation descendant of Toegye Yi Hwang, and spent his childhood learning Chinese literature from his grandfather. He wanted to gain insights into the sorrow at sovereignty taken away and the problem of the humanity loss by the war through Confucian thinking. His poetic perception of life and values are also the result of the extension of Confucian family tradition and learning that has continued since childhood. The natural environment and living environment to which he belongs have a relational attribute that cannot be separated from the identity of the writer.  Poetry is a literature that fully moderate emotions and implies poetic diction. Yuksa borrowed mostly metaphors and symbolic images, rather than revealing the grim reality as it is in his poem. In addition, he made people feel deep reason and insight by moderating his emotions as much as possible in the way he stated the images. This can be said to be based on the lyrical mind and warm-hearted contents expressed in the entire poem. Toegye called it Onyudonhu (溫柔敦厚), ""to bring out the good(善) with a sincere and clear sound."" Lee Yuksa pursues the Confucian world through lyricism and Onyudonhu (warm-hearted and compassionate mind) with the literature which is against injustice in extreme situations. Therefore, in this study, it will be examined how Confucian family tradition and Confucian ideas underlying Lee Yuksa""s poetic spirit were reflected in his poems. Through this, it will be an opportunity to look into his poems with a new perspective based on the lyricism and Onyudonhu (warm-hearted and compassionate mind) as one of the characteristics of Lee Yuksa’s poetry."

However, inappropriate administration and knowledge may result in risk of adverse reaction. As there are now ‘Safety Emergency Drugs’ sold outside the pharmacy for convenience of the consumers, it is difficult to control the drug administration, which is leading to more issues of adverse drug reaction and drug abuse. The purpose of this study is to provide the UI and UX design method to ‘Korea Pharmaceutical Information Center’ for efficient purchase of the drugs, safe administration and accurate delivery of information by using the application with good accessibility for the consumer to reduce the adverse drug reaction and drug abuse. For the scope of this study, 5 Korean pharmaceutical applications in IOS and Android environment were selected, and the design, user experience, search on target drug, and UI and UX items on the search results are included.  Empirical case analysis, ‘Usability Evaluation’ by Jakob Nielsen and trend evaluation method were used as the study method. Among these methods, the reaction effect on drug search-result which is the main function of the pharmaceutical application was used.  The results of this study are shown as follows. It was verified that the significant factors of pharmaceutical application were visibility, accuracy and consistency, and most of the applications lacked the membership system of managing the history of drugs administered by the consumers. In addition, the main function of drug search lacked the design on the image search function for users that do not know the drug name. Moreover, most of the applications were using blue-achromatic color. Insufficient matters in the ‘Korea Pharmaceutical Information Center’ included design fault on the icon, absence of navigation bar (poor visibility), error window and frequent menu registration function (poor efficiency), use of unnecessary elements on the main page (poor aesthetic impression), poor page conversion button and absence of use guide. Regarding the suggestion on the design direction, first, the re-design of an icon that is visible, highly understandable and with unity is required. Second, various search functions shall be used on the drug search page to support the convenience of the users. Additionally, the use of AI deep learning technology to add the ‘Image Search’ function is suggested. Third, the drug description page shall provide not only the information on the drug, but also be focused on the page layout to enhance the legibility. Fourth, the use of ‘Infographic’ is suggested for legibility on the medication counseling. Fifth, the application shall be changed to the membership system to enable mediation history management of the users. The significance of this study is to help the safe administration of drugs by the users."
