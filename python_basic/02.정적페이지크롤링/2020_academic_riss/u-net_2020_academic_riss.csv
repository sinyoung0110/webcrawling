SegNet과 U-Net을 활용한 동남아시아 지역 홍수탐지,2020,"['SegNet', 'U-Net', 'Sentinel-1 A/B', 'Flooded area extraction', 'Deep Learning', 'Semantic Segmentation']","홍수 발생 시 위성영상을 활용하여 침수된 지역을 추출하는 것은 홍수 발생 기간 내의 위성영상 취득과영상에 나타난 침수구역의 정확한 분류 등에서 많은 어려움이 존재한다. 딥러닝은 전통적인 영상분류기법들에 비해 보다 정확도가 높은 위성영상분류기법으로 주목받고 있지만, 광학영상에 비해 홍수 발생 시 위성영상의 취득이 용이한 SAR 영상의 분류 잠재력은 아직 명확히 규명되지 않았다. 본 연구는 대표적인 의미론적 영상 분할을 위한 딥러닝 모델인 SegNet과 U-Net을 활용하여 동남아시아의 라오스, 태국, 필리핀의 대표적인 홍수 발생지역인 코랏 유역(Khorat basin), 메콩강 유역(Mekong river basin), 카가얀강 유역(Cagayan river basin)에대해 Sentinel-1 A/B 위성영상으로부터 침수지역 추출을 실시하였다. 분석결과 침수지역 탐지에서 SegNet의 Global Accuracy, Mean IoU, Mean BF Score는 각각 0.9847, 0.6016, 0.6467로 나타났으며, U-Net의Global Accuracy, Mean IoU, Mean BF Score는 각각 0.9937, 0.7022, 0.7125로 나타났다. 국지적 분류결과 확인을 위한 육안검증에서 U-Net이 SegNet에 비해 보다 높은 분류 정확도를 보여주었지만, 모델의 훈련에 필요한 시간은 67분 17초와187분 19초가 각각 소요되어 SegNet이 U-Net에 비해 약 3배 정도 빠른 처리속도를 보여주었다. 본 연구의 결과는 향후 딥러닝 기법을 활용한 SAR 영상기반의 홍수탐지 모델과 실무적으로 활용이 가능한 자동화된 딥러닝기반의 수계탐지 기법의 제시를 위한 중요한 참고자료로 활용될 수 있을 것으로 판단된다.","Flood monitoring using satellite data has been constrained by obtaining satellite images for flood peak and accurately extracting flooded areas from satellite data. Deep learning is a promising method for satellite image classification, yet the potential of deep learning-based flooded area extraction using SAR data remained uncertain, which has advantages in obtaining data, comparing to optical satellite data. This research explores the performance of SegNet and U-Net on image segmentation by extracting flooded areas in the Khorat basin, Mekong river basin, and Cagayan river basin in Thailand, Laos, and the Philippines from Sentinel-1 A/B satellite data. Results show that Global Accuracy, Mean IoU, and Mean BF Score of SegNet are 0.9847, 0.6016, and 0.6467 respectively, whereas those of U-Net are 0.9937, 0.7022, 0.7125. Visual interpretation shows that the classification accuracy of U-Net is higher than SegNet, but overall processing time of SegNet is around three times faster than that of U-Net. It is anticipated that the results of this research could be used when developing deep learning-based flood monitoring models and presenting fully automated flooded area extraction models."

임베디드 연산을 위한 잡음에서 음성추출 U-Net 설계,2020,"['Speech enhancement', 'Noise reduction', 'Deep noise suppression', 'Deep neural network', 'wav-U-Net']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we propose wav-U-Net to improve speech enhancement in heavy noisy environments, and it has implemented three principal techniques. First, as input data, we use 128 modified Mel-scale filter banks which can reduce computational burden instead of 512 frequency bins. Mel-scale aims to mimic the non-linear human ear perception of sound by being more discriminative at lower frequencies and less discriminative at higher frequencies. Therefore, Mel-scale is the suitable feature considering both performance and computing power because our proposed network focuses on speech signals. Second, we add a simple ResNet as pre-processing that helps our proposed network make estimated speech signals clear and suppress high-frequency noises. Finally, the proposed U-Net model shows significant performance regardless of the kinds of noise. Especially, despite using a single channel, we confirmed that it can well deal with non-stationary noises whose frequency properties are dynamically changed, and it is possible to estimate speech signals from noisy speech signals even in extremely noisy environments where noises are much lauder than speech (less than SNR 0dB).The performance on our proposed wav-U-Net was improved by about 200% on SDR and 460% on NSDR compared to the conventional Jansson’s wav-U-Net. Also, it was confirmed that the processing time of out wav-U-Net with 128 modified Mel-scale filter banks was about 2.7 times faster than the common wav-U-Net with 512 frequency bins as input values."

Concrete cracking occurs due to a variety of causes and is a factor that can cause serious damage to the structure in the long term.In general, crack investigation uses an inspector’s visual inspection on the concrete surfaces, which is less objective in judgment and has a high possibility of human error. Therefore, a method with objective and accurate image analysis processing is required. In recent years, the methods using deep learning have been studied to detect cracks quickly and accurately. However, when the amount of crack data on the building or infrastructure to be inspected is small, existing crack detection models using it often show a limited performance. Therefore, in this study, an unsupervised anomaly detection method was used to augment the data on the object to be inspected, and as a result of learning using the data, we confirmed the performance of 98.78% of accuracy and 82.67% of harmonic average (F1_Score)."

Even with their wide application in many sectors, their usage in research community is limited. The main reason for this is the map compilation cycle varies too much over the different regions. The situation requires us a new and quicker methodology for generating land cover maps. This study was conducted to automatically generate land cover map using aerial ortho-images and Landsat 8 satellite images. The input aerial and Landsat 8 image data were trained by Residual U-Net, one of the deep learning-based segmentation techniques. Study was carried out by dividing three groups.

The proposed network is to preserve spatial information using SPADE. Change detection methods using high-resolution satellite images can be used to resolve various urban problems such as city planning and forecasting. For using pixel-based change detection, which is a conventional method such as Iteratively Reweighted-Multivariate Alteration Detection (IRMAD), unchanged areas will be detected as changing areas because changes in pixels are sensitive to the state of the environment such as seasonal changes between images. Therefore, in this paper, to precisely detect the changes of the objects that consist of the city in time-series satellite images, the semantic spatial objects that consist of the city are defined, extracted through deep learning based image segmentation, and then analyzed the changes between areas to carry out change detection. The semantic objects for analyzing changes were defined as six classes: building, road, farmland, vinyl house, forest area, and waterside area. Each network model learned with KOMPSAT-3A satellite images performs a change detection for the time-series KOMPSAT-3 satellite images. For objective assessments for change detection, we use F1-score, kappa. We found that the proposed method gives a better performance compared to U-Net and UNet++ by achieving an average F1-score of 0.77, kappa of 77.29."

Although a variety of underwater robots are designed for inspection, the exposed aggregate detection for identifying abrasion is often done by manual work. The scarcity of image samples, large differences in aggregate size, color and shape are the main difficulties in automatic detection. To address this problem, an improved Attention U-Net deep fully convolutional network-based detection method was proposed. To realize this method, underwater images in site were captured via a self-developed operated underwater robot. Through randomly separating and the cropping of the 128 underwater images, the 512×512 pixels images dataset was built according to the ratio of 8:1:1, including 408 training images, 52 validation images and 52 test images. After the data augmentation, loss function and the optimizer were carefully designed and selected, the proposed Attention U-Net architecture was evaluated on this dataset.

Stable Acquisition of Fine-Grained Segments Using Batch Normalization and Focal Loss with L1 Regularization in U-Net Structure,2020,"['Multi-scale segments', 'Batch normalization', 'Model prediction correction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Acquisition of fine-grained segments in semantic segmentation is important in most sementic segmentation applications, especially for clothing images composed of fine-grained textures. However, most existing semantic segmentation methods based on fully convolutional network (FCN) were not enough to acquire fine-grained segments because they are based on a single resolution and can not well distinguish between objects in the images. To stabilize the acquisition of fine-grained segments, we propose a method that is composed of two additional components in the U-Net structure for processing multi-scale fine-grained segments. The first component is to use normalization at all layers. We found from experiments that normalization is a key process in stabilizing the acquisition of fine-grained segments, especially in the U-Net based methods because they operate on a multi-scale fine-grained segment. An additional component is to use model prediction correction using focal loss with L1 regularization. Focal loss can be used to control the model prediction term as regularization in the training process. From experiments, we found that our method was better than the existing methods."

Although best practices have been discovered to meet the objectives in various industries, the general causal relationship between certification of new technologies and sales growth of companies is insufficient. This is because most of the certification studies focused on the relationship between ISO environmental certification or quality certification and financial performance. Therefore, this study verified the causal relationship between the new technology certification (NET) and the company's short-term sales growth based on data from 400 companies collected by the Korea Industrial Technology Association. Based on the company survey and literature research, cost reduction, quality improvement, and time reduction were derived as parameters between certification and management performance, and the effect of the parameters on sales was analyzed with a multiple regression model.As a result of analysis, the new technology certification (NET) increased sales through cost reduction and quality improvement, but time reduction was not a significant medium to increase sales. In addition, sales growth through quality improvement had a negative U-causal relationship. In other words, in SMEs, which account for 90% of the research targets, excessive quality improvement beyond the buyer's demand level through new technologies reduces sales, and the reduced time is likely to not be used significantly for activities to increase sales. This study is meaningful in that academically, it has been verified that the activation of the adoption of new technologies by companies through certification is a way to increase sales through cost reduction and quality improvement. In addition, through quality improvement and cost reduction effect analysis, it can contribute to designing an effective certification system that promotes short-term sales of companies and establishing related policies."
T-Net: Nested encoder–decoder architecture for the main vessel segmentation in coronary angiography,2020,"['Convolutional neural network', 'Main vessel segmentation', 'Coronary angiography', 'Encoder and decoder']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>In this paper, we proposed nested encoder–decoder architecture named T-Net. T-Net consists of several small encoder–decoders for each block constituting convolutional network. T-Net overcomes the limitation that U-Net can only have a single set of the concatenate layer between encoder and decoder block. To be more precise, the U-Net symmetrically forms the concatenate layers, so the low-level feature of the encoder is connected to the latter part of the decoder, and the high-level feature is connected to the beginning of the decoder. T-Net arranges the pooling and up-sampling appropriately during the encoding process, and likewise during the decoding process so that feature-maps of various sizes are obtained in a single block. As a result, all features from the low-level to the high-level extracted from the encoder are delivered from the beginning of the decoder to predict a more accurate mask. We evaluated T-Net for the problem of segmenting three main vessels in coronary angiography images. The experiment consisted of a comparison of U-Net and T-Nets under the same conditions, and an optimized T-Net for the main vessel segmentation. As a result, T-Net recorded a Dice Similarity Coefficient score (<I>DSC</I>) of 83.77%, 10.69% higher than that of U-Net, and the optimized T-Net recorded a <I>DSC</I> of 88.97% which was 15.89% higher than that of U-Net. In addition, we visualized the weight activation of the convolutional layer of T-Net and U-Net to show that T-Net actually predicts the mask from earlier decoders. Therefore, we expect that T-Net can be effectively applied to other similar medical image segmentation problems.</P>"
Multi-scale U-SegNet architecture with cascaded dilated convolutions for brain MRI Segmentation,2020,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Automatic segmentation of brain tissues such as WM, GM, and CSF from brain MRI scans is helpful for the diagnosis of many neurological disorders. Accurate segmentaion of these brain structures is a very challenging task due to low tissue contrast, bias filed, and partial volume effects. With the aim to improve brain MRI segmentation accuracy, we propose an end-to-end convolutional based U-SegNet architecture designed with multi-scale kernels, which includes cascaded dilated convolutions for the task of brain MRI segmentation. The multi-scale convolution kernels are designed to extract abundant semantic features and capture context information at different scales. Further, the cascaded dilated convolution scheme helps to alleviated the vanishing gradient problem in the proposed model. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed architecture is superior to the traditional deep-learning methods such as Segnet, U-net, and U-Segnet and achieves high performance with an average DSC of 93% and 86% of JI value for brain MRI segmentation."
CEO Overconfidence or Private Information: Evidence from U.S. Property-Liability Insurance Companies,2020,"['CEO Overconfidence', 'Risk Taking', 'Firm Performance', 'Reinsurance Demand']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper uses conventional measures of CEO overconfidence: option holdings-based and net stock purchase-based measures to examine the impact of CEOs who hold firm-specific risk on insurer’s risk-taking and firm performance in U.S. publicly traded property-liability insurance companies. We find that two CEO overconfidence measures are negatively associated with insurer’s risk-taking and positively related to firm performance. We also provide evidence that CEOs who maintain high exposure to firm-specific risk exploit their private information to time stock-option exercises in an effort to increase the cash payout from these exercises. Our overall results indicate that CEOs who have private information on their firms’ future earnings maximize their personal profits by postponing option exercises or buying additional stocks, and that they tend to take a lower risk to protect their personal wealth in property-liability insurance firms. Therefore, our findings suggest that it may not be CEO overconfidence, but rather the private information and the intention to control the company’s risk that drive our results."

Then economic net effects are estimated by using the input-output model based on the expenditure structure. According to the empirical results, if the overseas manufacturing companies make a 1.0% U-turn, the net effect of production is increased about 0.03~0.11%, that of value-added is 0.09~0.30%, and that of employment is 0.21~0.35%. However, due to actual constraints, it is difficult to keep the same volume of production in Korea as production in overseas location. Therefore, the real economic effect may be less than estimated. Anyway, the U-turn companies should create new employment as overseas labor costs are transferred to domestic. In order to maintain new employment in Korea, supporting policy should be strengthened, so that U-turn companies can run their businesses for a certain period of time, as well as inducing policy for U-turn. In addition, the location policy should be implemented because U-turn companies have different economic effects where they regionally locate."

In order to diagnose liver cancer, the patient's physical condition was checked by using a CT technique using radiation. Segmentation was needed to diagnose the liver on the patient's abdominal CT scan, which the radiologists had to do manually, which caused tremendous time and human mistakes. In order to automate, researchers attempted segmentation using image segmentation algorithms in computer vision field, but it was still time-consuming because of the interactive based and the setting value. To reduce time and to get more accurate segmentation, researchers have begun to attempt to segment the liver in CT images using CNNs, which show significant performance in various computer vision fields. The pixel value, or numerical value, of the CT image is called the Hounsfield Unit (HU) value, which is a relative representation of the transmittance of radiation, and usually ranges from about -2000 to 2000. In general, deep learning researchers reduce or limit this range and use it for training to remove noise and focus on the target organ. Here, we observed that the range of HU values was limited in many studies but different in various liver segmentation studies, and assumed that performance could vary depending on the HU range. In this paper, we propose the possibility of considering HU value range as a hyper parameter. U-Net and ResUNet were used to compare and experiment with different HU range limit preprocessing of CHAOS dataset under limited conditions. As a result, it was confirmed that the results are different depending on the HU range. This proves that the range limiting the HU value itself can be a hyper parameter, which means that there are HU ranges that can provide optimal performance for various models."

Since these missing data adversely affect the results of seismic data processing and analysis, we need to reconstruct the missing data before subsequent processing. However, there are economic and temporal burdens to conducting further exploration and reconstructing missing parts. Many researchers have been studying interpolation methods to accurately reconstruct missing data. Recently, various machine learning technologies such as support vector regression, autoencoder, U-Net, ResNet, and generative adversarial network (GAN) have been applied in seismic data interpolation. In this study, by reviewing these studies, we found that not only neural network models, but also support vector regression models that have relatively simple structures can interpolate missing parts of seismic data effectively.We expect that future research can improve the interpolation performance of these machine learning models by using open-source field data, data augmentation, transfer learning, and regularization based on conventional interpolation technologies."

Effects of US Monetary Policy on Gross Capital Flows: Cases in Korea,2020,"['U', 'S', 'Monetary Policy Spillovers', 'Gross Capital Flows', 'Local Projections', 'Financial Frictions']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"U.S. monetary policy has been claimed to generate global spillover and to destabilize other small open economies. We analyze the effects of certain identified U.S. monetary shocks on gross capital flows in the Korean economy using the local projection method. Consistent with previous results on other small open economies, we initially confirm that U.S. interest rate hikes are dynamically correlated with foreign outflows and residents' inflows. That is, not only are they correlated with withdrawals by foreigners but they are also correlated with those by domestic (Korean) investors. The results are mostly driven by portfolio flows. Second, however, the marginal response to a U.S. monetary policy shock is, on average, subdued if we focus on the sample periods after the Global financial crisis of 2007-2008 (henceforth, global financial crisis). We conjecture a possible reason behind the change, an institutional change related to financial friction. If the degree of pledgeability of the value of net worth increases, the marginal responses by both investors would drop with a U.S. monetary policy shock, consistent with our findings."

Investigating the Association between Residual State Ownership and Privatized Firm Efficiency,2020,"['Vietnam', 'Privatization', 'State Ownership', 'Firm Efficiency', 'Firm Performance']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper examines empirically the net impact of residual state ownership on privatized firm efficiency in the transitional context of Vietnam. Vietnamese privatization has its own characteristics. Instead of mass and full privatization, Vietnam has chosen a partial and gradual path. Thus, it is important to assess the net impact of residual state ownership on privatized firms during the post-privatization period. This study employs stochastic frontier analysis to investigate the association between residual state ownership and the efficiency of privatized firms, using a sample of all privatized firms that are listed on the Vietnamese stock exchanges over the period from 2007 to 2017. Also, two-stage least squares regression is incorporated into the model to deal with potential endogeneity issues. Our study provides evidence that state ownership should not be considered as a pure source of agency problems. Indeed, the net impact of residual state ownership on privatized firm efficiency is non-monotonic, and the relationship between residual state ownership and privatized firm efficiency is under an inverted U-shape. A moderate level (less than 50%) of residual state ownership might be beneficial to privatized firm efficiency whereas too much state ownership is detrimental to the efficiency of privatized firms."

As one such approach, the paper develops a model to predict the likelihood of hospital admission for Medicare and Medicaid insurers in the U.S. The analysis draws from the health insurance claims data of 45,000 patients with 939 features, spanning eight quarters from 2014 and 2015. Six models are adopted to predict patients' hospital admissions in 2016, based on their sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. The paper presents the rationale, processes, and results of analysis from logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, feed-forward Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolution Neural Network, and Recurrent Neural Network. The best performing model, evaluated against recall and precision scores, is the MPL. This simple deep learning model was correct about 80% of the time for patient admissions to hospital. Additionally, tree-based algorithms provide important features related to hospital admission, such as medical risk scores. As a policy implication, the paper discusses predictive risk modeling to provide preventive care for at-risk populations. The paper concludes by suggesting strategies for using the data science approach in the allocation of social welfare programs and services."

And the results were compared and evaluated with the translation model. For training and validation of deep neural network, Mt. Gwanak and Mt. Gwangdeoksan radar data were collected from 2010 to 2016 and converted to a gray-scale image file in an HDF5 format with a 1km spatial resolution. The deep neural network model was trained to predict precipitation after 10 minutes by using the four consecutive radar image data, and the recursive method of repeating forecasts was applied to carry out lead time 60 minutes with the pretrained deep neural network model. To evaluate the performance of deep neural network prediction model, 24 rain cases in 2017 were forecast for rainfall up to 60 minutes in advance. As a result of evaluating the predicted performance by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) and critical success index (CSI) at the threshold of 0.1, 1, and 5 mm/hr, the deep neural network model showed better performance in the case of rainfall threshold of 0.1, 1 mm/hr in terms of MAE, and showed better performance than the translation model for lead time 50 minutes in terms of CSI. In particular, although the deep neural network prediction model performed generally better than the translation model for weak rainfall of 5 mm/hr or less, the deep neural network prediction model had limitations in predicting distinct precipitation characteristics of high intensity as a result of the evaluation of threshold of 5 mm/hr. The longer lead time, the spatial smoothness increase with lead time thereby reducing the accuracy of rainfall prediction The translation model turned out to be superior in predicting the exceedance of higher intensity thresholds (> 5 mm/hr) because it preserves distinct precipitation characteristics, but the rainfall position tends to shift incorrectly. This study are expected to be helpful for the improvement of radar rainfall prediction model using deep neural networks in the future. In addition, the massive weather radar data established in this study will be provided through open repositories for future use in subsequent studies."

This approach integrates the local-features at different scales and underlines the essential features by suppressing noises and unwanted information.

This study solved this problem by using DID(Difference in Difference) estimation. So economic effect are divided into two. One is the economic effect estimated by the current WIOT, and the other is the economic effect estimated by WIOT when U.S. does not exist in the world. There are two hypotheses in this study. The first one is that the KORUS FTA increases effects on Korean economy. The second one is that KORUS FTA improves trade balance in Value-added. One of the results of the first hypothesis test is that KORUS FTA increases the production inducement coefficients and value-added inducement coefficients of manufacture, Construction, and Service. But it does not increase Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing, and Mining and quarrying. However the result of the second hypothesis test shows that KORUS FTA improves trade balance in value-added in all industries. In particular, the KORUS FTA has a positive effects on the Korean economy, as manufacture and service industries account for a large portion of the Korean economy. This study is meaningful in that it suggests a new methodology based on the WIOT, unlike previous studies, in examining the economic effects of the KORUS FTA on Korea."

The first main empirical finding shows a significant discount for the banks in the upper quantiles of the risk-adjusted market value distributions.

These findings are consistent with the view that the diversification discount reflects an opportunity cost in adjusting a dynamic value-maximizing strategy."

Korean baseball league is different from the Major League Baseball in the U.S. in that teams are explicitly associated with chaebol conglomerates, generating a direct and cross-sectional variation in investor sentiment. Using daily fund flow data, we find evidence of significant outflows from funds that hold a large weight on a conglomerate member following the team’s loss the previous day. This effect is the strongest among online retail funds, and this outflow does not appear to be driven by the investors’ prescient response to poor future returns.

The traditional hypotheses have paid attention to the sharp decline in foreign loans due to the plunge in U.S. stock prices, sluggish exports due to the Reichsmark's overvaluation, and failures in Brünning's economic policy. Unlike traditional hypotheses, this article found the cause of the German Great Depression in the structural factors inside Germany. Some scholars believe that the Great Depression occurred when foreign capital rapidly outflowed from Germany as a result of the massive collapse of U.S. stock prices in October 1929. However, until 1930, the net outflow of capital was not so severe, and the capital account was rather a surplus. Their views are inconsistent with historical facts in that the sharp decline in foreign loans was triggered by the banking crisis in mid-1931, and that the German economic downturn had already started in the fall of 1927, long before the decline in foreign loans. Although the share of German exports in the world declined significantly, export sluggishness cannot be regarded as the cause of the Great Depression, considering that the share of exports compared to GNP increased until 1931. The direct start of the Great Depression was that real wages rose at a much faster rate than labor productivity, resulting in extremely sluggish private investment.Some scholars argue that the Great Depression could have been prevented if the Brünning administration had implemented a Keynesian fiscal and monetary policy. This retrospective optimism can be said to have originated from an incomprehension of the fact that the area of ​​policy at the time was extremely limited. Sufficient policy resources could not be secured, and the task of solving the “fear of inflation” and the reparation was also a significant policy constraint. Even if such an expansive policy was implemented, the political price was so great that it would not have been able to properly act as a catalyst for the economic transformation, and considering the time lag in policy effects, it is unlikely that the lowest point of the Great Depression in the summer of 1932 was advanced. The effectiveness of the policy is also questioned. In a situation where the distribution structure was severely distorted, the expansion of fiscal expenditure would have caused inflation, the low interest rate policy would have aggravated the capital shortage caused by the reduction of the inflow of the foreign capital, and the devaluation policy would not have contributed to the improvement of the balance of payments. Since the deflation policy was a somewhat valid remedy that could be taken under internal and external constraints, the “meaning crisis” hypothesis loses its basis."""

Methods: The four roughages were co-cultured with Pleurotus ostreatus. The chemical composition; enzyme activities of laccase, carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) and xylanase; carbohydrate and protein fractions (based on The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System [CNCPS]) were assessed at different days after inoculation (7, 14, 21, 28 d) and un-inoculated roughages (control, 0 d). The digestibility of nutrient components and the gas production of roughage with various incubation times were monitored at 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h using an in vitro ruminal fermentation method. Results: A higher CMCase activity (0.1039 U/mL) and earlier time to peak (14 d) were detected in Pleurotus ostreatus cultured with CS (p<0.05). Significantly, the incubation length-dependent responses of cumulative gas production were observed from 24 to 72 hours post fermentation (p<0.05), and these incubation length-dependent effects on cumulative gas production of PS and CS appeared earlier (24 h) for PS and CS than those (48 h) for BBS and RS (p<0.05). The fast-degradable carbohydrate (CA) content for all four roughages significantly increased over time (p<0.05). Nonetheless, increased degradation efficiency for CA treated with Pleurotus ostreatus was detected at both 21 and 28 days of incubation (p<0.05). With the exception of PS (p<0.05), there were no significant difference among the roughages (p>0.05) in slowly-degradable carbohydrate (CB2) at different incubation times (p<0.05). Conclusion: Assessment of the alterations in chemical composition, CNCPS system fractions, and the fermentation kinetics after biological pretreatment may yield a valuable database for evaluating the biological pretreatment of Pleurotus ostreatus in ruminant feed."

Recently, a lot of automatic diagnosis algorithms have been studied to find the lung nodules missed by doctors. The algorithms are typically based on segmentation network like U-Net. However, the occurrence of false positives that similar to lung nodules present outside the lungs can severely degrade performance. In this study, we propose a multi-task learning method that simultaneously learns the lung region and nodule-labeled data based on the prior knowledge that lung nodules exist only in the lung. The proposed method significantly reduces false positives outside the lung and improves the recognition rate of lung nodules to 83.8 F1 score compared to 66.6 F1 score of single task learning with U-net model. The experimental results on the JSRT public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other baseline methods."

Deep Learning: High-quality Imaging through Multicore Fiber,2020,"['Deep learning', 'Multi-core fiber', 'Imaging']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Imaging through multicore fiber (MCF) is of great significance in the biomedical domain. Although several techniques have been developed to image an object from a signal passing through MCF, these methods are strongly dependent on the surroundings, such as vibration and the temperature fluctuation of the fiber’s environment. In this paper, we apply a new, strong technique called deep learning to reconstruct the phase image through a MCF in which each core is multimode. To evaluate the network, we employ the binary cross-entropy as the loss function of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with improved U-net structure. The high-quality reconstruction of input objects upon spatial light modulation (SLM) can be realized from the speckle patterns of intensity that contain the information about the objects.Moreover, we study the effect of MCF length on image recovery. It is shown that the shorter the fiber, the better the imaging quality. Based on our findings, MCF may have applications in fields such as endoscopic imaging and optical communication."

Document Image Binarization by GAN with Unpaired Data Training,2020,"['document image binarization', 'unpaired training data', 'gan', 'unsupervised learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Data is critical in deep learning but the scarcity of data often occurs in research, especially in the preparation of the paired training data. In this paper, document image binarization with unpaired data is studied by introducing adversarial learning, excluding the need for supervised or labeled datasets. However, the simple extension of the previous unpaired training to binarization inevitably leads to poor performance compared to paired data training. Thus, a new deep learning approach is proposed by introducing a multidiversity of higher quality generated images. In this paper, a two-stage model is proposed that comprises the generative adversarial network (GAN) followed by the U-net network. In the first stage, the GAN uses the unpaired image data to create paired image data. With the second stage, the generated paired image data are passed through the U-net network for binarization. Thus, the trained U-net becomes the binarization model during the testing. The proposed model has been evaluated over the publicly available DIBCO dataset and it outperforms other techniques on unpaired training data. The paper shows the potential of using unpaired data for binarization, for the first time in the literature, which can be further improved to replace paired data training for binarization in the future."

All included patients underwent CCTA with iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE level 3, Siemens Healthineers). We developed a deep learning based denoising technique (ClariCT.AI, ClariPI), which was based on a modified U-net type convolutional neural net model designed to predict the possible occurrence of low-dose noise in the originals. Denoised images were obtained by subtracting the predicted noise from the originals. Image noise, CT attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were objectively calculated. The edge rise distance (ERD) was measured as an indicator of image sharpness. Two blinded readers subjectively graded the image quality using a 5-point scale. Diagnostic performance of the CCTA was evaluated based on the presence or absence of significant stenosis (≥ 50% lumen reduction).Results: Objective image qualities (original vs. denoised: image noise, 67.22 ± 25.74 vs. 52.64 ± 27.40; SNR [left main], 21.91 ± 6.38 vs. 30.35 ± 10.46; CNR [left main], 23.24 ± 6.52 vs. 31.93 ± 10.72; all p < 0.001) and subjective image quality (2.45 ± 0.62 vs. 3.65 ± 0.60, p < 0.001) improved significantly in the denoised images. The average ERDs of the denoised images were significantly smaller than those of originals (0.98 ± 0.08 vs. 0.09 ± 0.08, p < 0.001). With regard to diagnostic accuracy, no significant differences were observed among paired comparisons.Conclusion: Application of the deep learning technique along with iterative reconstruction can enhance the noise reduction performance with a significant improvement in objective and subjective image qualities of CCTA images."

A study on selective dehazing system based on haze detection network,2020,"['Image processing', 'Deep neural network', 'Dehazing', 'Haze detection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Image dehazing, which aims to recover a clear image solely from a hazy or foggy image, is a particularly challenging task. Many studies have recently been conducted to improve the performance of image dehazing using deep neural networks. However, existing approaches do not consider changes in haze density, and thus even if a clear image is input, distortions such as sharpening may occur. In addition, because the number of datasets available in deep learning, whose contents are image pairs of hazy and corresponding haze-free (ground truth) indoor images, is quite limited, the haze removal performance may be reduced. To solve this problem, in this paper, a selective dehazing system is proposed that combines a haze detection network and a dehazing network. The proposed haze detection network is designed using a CNN structure to determine the haze density of the input image, and the use of the dehazing network is determined. The proposed dehazing network uses the U-Net model to efficiently learn only a limited number of datasets. To evaluate the performance of the proposed network, only 45 O-Hazes were used. The result of haze detection shows that the proba-bility of detecting a haze image is more than 99% and the probability of detecting a haze-free image is 97.9%. Dehazing evaluation results improved the PSNR and SSIM by more than 10% compared to existing networks."

The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of the selfsupervised methods (noise2noise: N2N and noiser2noise: Nr2N) for PET image denoising based on the measured PET data sets by comparing their performance with the conventional N2C model.Methods For training and evaluating the networks, 18F-FDG brain PET/CT scan data of 14 patients was retrospectively used (10 for training and 4 for testing). From the 60-min list-mode data, we generated a total of 100 data bins with 10-s duration. We also generated 40-s-long data by adding four non-overlapping 10-s bins and 300-s-long reference data by adding all list-mode data.We employed U-Net that is widely used for various tasks in biomedical imaging to train and test proposed denoising models.Results All the N2C, N2N, and Nr2N were effective for improving the noisy inputs. While N2N showed equivalent PSNR to the N2C in all the noise levels, Nr2N yielded higher SSIM than N2N. N2N yielded denoised images similar to reference image with Gaussian filtering regardless of input noise level. Image contrast was better in the N2N results.Conclusion The self-supervised denoising method will be useful for reducing the PET scan time or radiation dose."

It requires, however, accurate positioning of an endoscope to avoid spinal nerves and to locate the endoscope near the target disk. Before the insertion of the endoscope, a guide needle is inserted to guide it. Also, the result of the surgery highly depends on the surgeons’ experience and the patients’ CT or MRI images. Thus, for the training, a number of haptic simulators for spinal needle insertion have been developed. But, still, it is difficult to be used in the medical field practically because previous studies require manual segmentation of vertebrae from CT images, and interaction force between the needle and soft tissue has not been considered carefully. This paper proposes AI-based automatic vertebrae CT-image segmentation and haptic rendering method using the proposed need-tissue interaction model. For the segmentation, U-net structure was implemented and the accuracy was 93% in pixel and 88% in IoU. The needle-tissue interaction model including puncture force and friction force was implemented for haptic rendering in the proposed spinal needle insertion simulator."

Keypoints-Based 2D Virtual Try-on Network System,2020,"['Virtual Try-On', 'Image Synthesis', 'Image Warping', 'Human Body Parsing', 'Keypoints Prediction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Image-based Virtual Try-On Systems are among the most potential solution for virtual fitting which tries on a target clothes into a model person image and thus have attracted considerable research efforts. In many cases, current solutions for those fails in achieving naturally looking virtual fitted image where a target clothes is transferred into the body area of a model person of any shape and pose while keeping clothes context like texture, text, logo without distortion and artifacts. In this paper, we propose a new improved image-based virtual try-on network system based on keypoints, which we name as KP-VTON. The proposed KP-VTON first detects keypoints in the target clothes and reliably predicts keypoints in the clothes of a model person image by utilizing a dense human pose estimation. Then, through TPS transformation calculated by utilizing the keypoints as control points, the warped target clothes image, which is matched into the body area for wearing the target clothes, is obtained. Finally, a new try-on module adopting Attention U-Net is applied to handle more detailed synthesis of virtual fitted image. Extensive experiments on a well-known dataset show that the proposed KP-VTON performs better the state-of-the-art virtual try-on systems."
러시아와 중국의 천연가스 사업협력:배경과 전망,2020,"['러시아', '중국', '에너지 정책', 'LNG', 'PNG', 'Russia', 'China', 'Energy Policy', 'LNG', 'PNG']","2019년 12월 2일 러시아의 시베리아 동부 천연가스 파이프라인인 ‘시베리아의 힘(Power of Siberia)’이 개통되었다. ‘Power of Siberia’는 러시아 시베리아 지역에서 생산되는 천연가스를 중국으로 공급하는 연장 약 3000km의 파이프라인이다. 파이프라인 건설을 위해서 중국과 러시아는 550억달러를 투자하였다. ‘Power of Siberia’를 통해서, 러시아 국영 에너지기업 가즈프롬은 향후 30년 동안 연간 38Bcm의 천연가스를 중국으로 공급할 계획이다. 중국과 러시아는 인접국임에도 불구하고 현재까지 양측을 연결하는 가스파이프 라인이 없었다. 중국입장에서는 자국에 천연가스전이 있었고, 러시아입장에서도 천연가스를 유럽에 수익이 좋은 가격으로 판매할 수 있었기 때문에 극동지역가스루트 개발에 큰 관심이 없었다. 그러나 러시아의 크림반도 병합이후, EU로 부터 러시아의 EU가스시장 지배에 대한 EU측 규제가 증대하고 있는 상황에 직면하였다. 이와 같은 문제에 대한 해결책으로 러시아는 중국으로의 천연가스 수출에서 활로를 찾으려하고 있다. 이는 중국 역시 중국의 스모그 문제의 주범의 하나인 석탄을 대체하기 위해서 천연가스 사용을 급격하게 증가시키고 있다. 그 결과 2007년에는 중국이 천연가스 순수입국이 되었다. 이와 같은 상황변화에 따라 중국과 러시아 양국 간의 천연가스 협력은 탄력을 받게 되었다.또한 중국은 러시아의 북극 천연가스 개발에도 적극 참여하고 있다. CNPC는 러시아 민간가스기업 노바텍(Novatek)의 야말-LNG 사업 20% 지분을 인수하였고, 20년간 300만 톤의 LNG를 구입하는 계약을 체결하였다. 중국의 입장에서 러시아에서 가스프롬 이외에 천연가스 공급원을 확보하는 것이 중요하다는 점이 반영된 결정이었다. 러시아의 對서방 제재가 지속되고, 미중 무역분쟁이 악화되는 상황에서 중국과 러시아는 에너지협력을 확대할 것이다. 그러나 저유가 상황에서 자금이 부족한 러시아가 러시아 내 파이프라인 공사의 진척과 LNG 수출시설의 확대에 어떻게 대처하는가가 향후 중국과 러시아 협력의 결과를 결정하는데 중요한 변수로 작용할 것이다.중국은 현재 투르크메니스탄, 우즈베키스탄, 카자흐스탄, 미얀마 등에서 천연가스를 파이프라인을 통해 도입하고 있고, 향후 이를 더욱 확대할 계획이다. 따라서 중국과 러시아 천연가스 협력 상황의 발전은 러시아 투자능력에 달려있다.","On December 2, 2019, the Power of Siberia, Russia’s eastern Siberian natural gas pipeline, was brought into operation. The Power of Siberia is a 3,000-kilometer-long pipeline that supplies China with natural gas from Russia’s Siberia region. China and Russia have invested $55 billion to build the pipeline. Through Power of Siberia, Russia’s state-run energy company Gazprom plans to supply China with 38B of natural gas annually for the next 30 years.China and Russia have so far had no gas pipe lines linking the two sides, despite being neighboring countries. China has natural gas fields and Russia was not interested in developing gas routes in the Far East because Russia has been the dominant source and supplier of natural gas to the EU.However, since Russia's annexation of Crimea, Russia has faced increasing EU sanctions on Russia. As a solution to this problem, Russia is trying to find alternative export destinations. In order to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas, China is trying to reduce the use of coal. As a result, China became a net importer of natural gas in 2007. In this context, Russia and China have been deepening the energy cooperations.China is also actively involved in Russia's development of Arctic natural gas. CNPC acquired a 20 percent stake in Russian private gas company Novatek’s Yamal-LNG Project and signed a deal to purchase 3 million tons of LNG over 20 years. China’s intention is the diversification of natural gas import other than Gazprom.China and Russia will expand energy cooperation if the EU and USA are continuing its sanction on Russia and the U.S.-China trade dispute is not settled. However Russia has the shortage of financial resource due to low oil prices. Russia has difficulties in pipeline construction in Russia and the expansion of LNG export facilities.China is currently introducing natural gas through pipelines in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Myanmar, and plans to expand it in the future. Thus, the development of the China-Russia natural gas cooperation depends on Russia’s investment capabilities."

Various studies have found that lower back pain is a very common problem among adolescents, and the highest incidence rates are for adults in their 30s. There has been a remarkable increase in using computer-aided diagnosis to assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images. Spine segmentation in computed tomography (CT) scans using algorithmic methods allows improved diagnosis of back pain. Methods: In this study, we developed a web-based automatic spine segmentation method using deep learning and obtained the dice coefficient by comparison with the predicted image. Our method is based on convolutional neural networks for segmentation. More specifically, we train a hierarchical data format file using U-Net architecture and then insert the test data label to perform segmentation. Thus, we obtained more specific and detailed results. A total of 344 CT images were used in the experiment. Of these, 330 were used for learning, and the remaining 14 for testing. Results: Our method achieved an average dice coefficient of 90.4%, a precision of 96.81%, and an F1-score of 91.64%.Conclusions: The proposed web-based deep learning approach can be very practical and accurate for spine segmentation as a diagnostic method."

Commonly representative methods for classifying the stages of liver fibrosis include liver biopsy and diagnosis based on ultrasound images. The overall liver shape and the smoothness and roughness of speckle pattern represented in ultrasound images are used for determining the fibrosis stages. Although the ultrasound image based classification is used frequently as an alternative or complementary method of the invasive biopsy, it also has the limitations that liver fibrosis stage decision depends on the image quality and the doctor’s experience. With the rapid development of deep learning algorithms, several studies using deep learning methods have been carried out for automated liver fibrosis classification and showed superior performance of high accuracy. The performance of those deep learning methods depends closely on the amount of datasets. We propose an enhanced U-net architecture to maximize the classification accuracy with limited small amount of image datasets. U-net is well known as a neural network for fast and precise segmentation of medical images. We design it newly for the purpose of classifying liver fibrosis stages.In order to assess the performance of the proposed architecture, numerical experiments are conducted on a total of 118 ultrasound B-mode images acquired from 78 patients with liver fibrosis symptoms of F0~F4 stages. The experimental results support that the performance of the proposed architecture is much better compared to the transfer learning using the pre-trained model of VGGNet."

We performed a costbenefit analysis using the extended SEIR model to assess whether maintaining the current level of COVID-19 testing is an economically rational choice compared with counterfactual scenarios. Our results suggest that the relationship between the net benefits and the level of testing assumes an inverted-U shape, which means that comprehensive diagnostic testing is effective in flattening the infection curve, but it is a financial burden to society. This study provides evidence that comprehensive diagnostic testing would not be a good strategy for countries with scant financial and medical resources, considering the costs. Furthermore, undertaking comprehensive diagnostic testing without implementing other strategies is a limited approach to preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Therefore, this study suggests that policy makers should find ways to improve the effectiveness of tests, not just increase the level of tests."

First, we investigate the (net) demand for local currencies in foreign exchange reserves because introducing local currency contribution is efficient only when sufficient demand exists. The main results are as follows. i) Substantial demand exists for local currencies in foreign exchange reserves. ii) The size of the demand for local currencies in foreign exchange reserves is large in comparison with the size of the maximum withdrawal from CMIM. iii) Net demand for local currencies in CMIM tends to be positive. Second, the stability of local currencies is analyzed by calculating the exchange market pressure index because costs of local currency contribution to CMIM arrangements can be high if local currencies are unstable. The results suggest that several currencies of ASEAN+3 members are as stable as popular non-U.S. international currencies for various sub-periods. The results in terms of stability of the currency, internationalization of currency, and liberalization of capital account transactions, indicate that the Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and Korean won could first be considered eligible for local currency contribution to CMIM arrangements. Overall, the results may support the idea of introducing local currency contribution to CMIM arrangements."
Passive increase in driving force in vortex-induced vibration of a semi-hollow cylinder for Reynolds number 200,2020,['· Computational fluid dynamics · Fluid-structure interaction · Vortex-induced vibration · Energy harvester'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"We present a semi-hollow body as an effective strategy to increase the driving force for vortex-induced vibrations (VIVs) of a circular cylinder. The hollow-body concept is evaluated numerically at Reynolds number Re = 200 and in a range of reduced velocity 3 ≤ U red≤ 8 with a mass-spring system released to vibrate in the transverse direction. Our numerical solutions reveal that, compared with solid-cylinder counterparts, the net transverse force is increased significantly through the semi-hollow body. The transverse force acting on the inner surface is found to be developed as a consequence of semi-confined flows driven by the cylinder oscillation. Furthermore, it is shown that the inner force has a phase difference with respect to the force acting on the outer surface. Based on a systematic force analysis, the appreciable increase in the transverse force is attributed to the constructive interference between the inner and outer forces."

Farm household income moves drawing inverse U shape.Moreover, cohort effects show that younger generations have earned more income than older generation, which has been resulted from economic growth. It is also noteworthy that transfer from public sector increases by age and younger generations receive more benefits from government than older generations while transfer from family and friends changes in different directions. This implies that the role of government is getting bigger in safety net among farm households and welfare expenditure is likely to explosively increase as farm population rapidly gets old."
