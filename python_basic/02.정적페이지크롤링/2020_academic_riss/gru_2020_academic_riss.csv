Study on Fast-Changing Mixed-Modulation Recognition Based on Neural Network Algorithms,2020,"['Neural Network', 'Fast-Changing', 'Mixed-Modulation', 'MR', 'LSTM', 'GRU']",,"Modulation recognition (MR) plays a key role in cognitive radar, cognitive radio, and some other civilian and military fields. While existing methods can identify the signal modulation type by extracting the signal characteristics, the quality of feature extraction has a serious impact on the recognition results. In this paper, an end-to-end MR method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is put forward, which can directly predict the modulation type from a sampled signal. Additionally, the sliding window method is applied to fast-changing mixed-modulation signals for which the signal modulation type changes over time. The recognition accuracy on training datasets in different SNR ranges and the proportion of each modulation method in misclassified samples are analyzed, and it is found to be reasonable to select the evenly-distributed and full range of SNR data as the training data. With the improvement of the SNR, the recognition accuracy increases rapidly. When the length of the training dataset increases, the neural network recognition effect is better. The loss function value of the neural network decreases with the increase of the training dataset length, and then tends to be stable. Moreover, when the fast-changing period is less than 20ms, the error rate is as high as 50%. As the fast-changing period is increased to 30ms, the error rates of the GRU and LSTM neural networks are less than 5%."
합리적인 하천수 관리체계 구축을 위한 자료기반 방류량 예측모형 개발,2020,[],,"In most cases of the water balance analysis, the return flow ratio for each water supply was uniformly determined and applied, so it has been contained a problem that the volume of available water would be incorrectly calculated. Therefore, sewage and wastewater among the return water were focused in this study and the data-driven model was developed to forecast the outflow from the sewage treatment plant. The forecasting results of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Units), and SVR (Support Vector Regression) models, which are mainly used for forecasting the time series data in most fields, were compared with the observed data to determine the optimal model parameters for forecasting outflow. As a result of applying the model, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the GRU model was smaller than those of the LSTM and SVR models, and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) was higher than those of others. Thus, it was judged that the GRU model could be the optimal model for forecasting the outflow in sewage treatment plants. However, the forecasting outflow tends to be underestimated and overestimated in extreme sections. Therefore, the additional data for extreme events and reducing the minimum time unit of input data were necessary to enhance the accuracy of forecasting. If the water use of the target site was reviewed and the additional parameters that could reflect seasonal effects were considered, more accurate outflow could be forecasted to be ready for climate variability in near future. And it is expected to use as fundamental resources for establishing a reasonable river water management system based on the forecasting results."

The sleep structure can be represented by the percentage of different sleep stages during the total sleep time. In this study, we proposed a method for automatic classification of sleep stages from an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal using a gated-recurrent unit (GRU). The proposed method performed multiclass classification for three-class sleep stages such as awake, light, and deep sleep. A deep structured GRU was used in the proposed method, which is a common recurrent neural network. The proposed deep learning (SleepGRU) model consists of a 5-layer GRU and is optimized by batch-normalization, dropout, and Adam update rules. The ECG signal was recorded during nocturnal polysomnography from 112 subjects, and was normalized and segmented into units of 30-second duration. To train and evaluate the proposed method, the training set consisted of 80,316 segments from 89 subjects, and the test set used 20,079 segments from 23 subjects. We achieved good performances with an overall accuracy of 80.43% and F1-score of 80.07% for the test set.

Real-time Depth Estimation Using Recurrent CNN with Sparse Depth Cues for SLAM System,2020,"['Deep learning', 'depth estimation', 'geometry recovery', 'SLAM', 'vision based navigation']",,"Depth map has been utilized for refinement of geometric information in a variety of fields such as 3D reconstruction and pose estimation in SLAM system where ill-posed problems are occurred. Currently, as learning-based approaches are successfully introduced throughout many problems of vision-based fields, several depth estimation algorithms based on CNN are suggested, which only conduct training of spatial information. Since an image sequence or video used for SLAM system tends to have temporal information, this paper proposes a recurrent CNN architecture for SLAM system to estimate depth map by exploring not only spatial but also temporal information by using convolutional GRU cell, which is constructed to remember weights of past convolutional layers. Furthermore, this paper proposes using additional layers that preserve structure of scenes by utilizing sparse depth cues obtained from SLAM system. The sparse depth cues are produced by projecting reconstructed 3D map into each camera frame, and the sparse cues help to predict accurate depth map avoiding ambiguity of depth map generation of untrained structures in latent space. Despite accuracy of depth cues according to monocular SLAM system degrades than stereo SLAM system, the proposed masking approach, which takes the confidence of depth cues with regard to a relative camera pose between current frame and previous frame, retains the performance of the proposed system with the proposed adaptive regularization in loss function. In the training phase, by preprocessing exponential quantization of ground-truth depth map to eliminate the ill-effects of the captured large distances, the depth map prediction of the proposed system improves more than other baseline methods with accomplishment of real-time system. We expect that this proposed system can be used in SLAM system to refine geometric information for more accurate 3D reconstruction and pose estimation, which are essential parts for robust navigation system of robots."

The DRL model was consisted of shared, value and policy networks, and the networks included convolutional layers, rectified linear unit (ReLU), dilation factors and gate rotation unit (GRU) in order to extract noise features from CT images and improve the performance of the DRL model. Also, the quality of the CT images obtained by using the DRL model was compared to that obtained by using the supervised deep learning model. The results showed that the image accuracy for the DRL model was higher than that for the supervised deep learning model, and the image noise for the DRL model was smaller than that for the supervised deep learning model. Also, the DRL model reduced the noise of the CT images, which had different characteristics with training images. Therefore, the DRL model is able to reduce image noise as well as maintain the structural information of CT images."
페이로드 임베딩 사전학습 기반의 웹 공격 분류 모델,2020,"['Web Attack', 'Payload', 'BPE(Byte Pair Encoding)', 'Wrod embedding', 'Deep learning']","인터넷 사용자가 폭발적으로 늘어나면서 웹을 이용한 공격이 증가했다. 뿐만 아니라 기존의 방어 기법들을 우회하기 위해 공격 패턴이 다양해졌다. 전통적인 웹 방화벽은 알져지지 않은 패턴의 공격을 탐지하기 어렵다. 따라서 인공지능으로 비정상을 탐지하는 방식이 대안으로 연구되고 있다. 특히 공격에 악용되는 스크립트나 쿼리가 텍스트로 이루어져 있다는 이유로 자연어 처리 기법을 적용하는 시도가 일어나고 있다. 하지만 스크립트나 쿼리는 미등록 단어(Unknown word)가 다량 발생하기 때문에 자연어 처리와는 다른 방식의 접근이 필요하다. 본 논문에서는 BPE(Byte Pair Encoding)기법으로 웹 공격 페이로드에 자주 사용되는 토큰 집합을 추출하여 임베딩 벡터를 학습시키고, 주의 메커니즘 기반의 Bi-GRU 신경망으로 토큰의 순서와 중요도를 학습하여 웹 공격을 분류하는 모델을 제안한다. 주요 웹 공격인 SQL 삽입 공격, 크로스 사이트 스크립팅, 명령 삽입 공격에 대하여 분류 평가 결과 약 0.9990의 정확도를 얻었으며, 기존 연구에서 제안한 모델의 성능을 상회하는 결과를 도출하였다.","As the number of Internet users exploded, attacks on the web increased. In addition, the attack patterns have been diversified to bypass existing defense techniques. Traditional web firewalls are difficult to detect attacks of unknown patterns.Therefore, the method of detecting abnormal behavior by artificial intelligence has been studied as an alternative. Specifically, attempts have been made to apply natural language processing techniques because the type of script or query being exploited consists of text. However, because there are many unknown words in scripts and queries, natural language processing requires a different approach. In this paper, we propose a new classification model which uses byte pair encoding (BPE) technology to learn the embedding vector, that is often used for web attack payloads, and uses an attention mechanism-based Bi-GRU neural network to extract a set of tokens that learn their order and importance. For major web attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and command injection attacks, the accuracy of the proposed classification method is about 0.9990 and its accuracy outperforms the model suggested in the previous study."
Gated Recurrent Unit Architecture for Context-Aware Recommendations with improved Similarity Measures,2020,"['Context Aware Recommender System', 'Recurrent Neural Network', 'Sequence Aware Recommender System', 'Dynamic Temporal Matching', 'Deep Recommender System Models']",,"Recommender Systems (RecSys) have a major role in e-commerce for recommending products, which they may like for every user and thus improve their business aspects. Although many types of RecSyss are there in the research field, the state of the art RecSys has focused on finding the user similarity based on sequence (e.g. purchase history, movie-watching history) analyzing and prediction techniques like Recurrent Neural Network in Deep learning. That is RecSys has considered as a sequence prediction problem. However, evaluation of similarities among the customers is challenging while considering temporal aspects, context and multi-component ratings of the item-records in the customer sequences. For addressing this issue, we are proposing a Deep Learning based model which learns customer similarity directly from the sequence to sequence similarity as well as item to item similarity by considering all features of the item, contexts, and rating components using Dynamic Temporal Warping(DTW) distance measure for dynamic temporal matching and 2D-GRU (Two Dimensional-Gated Recurrent Unit) architecture. This will overcome the limitation of non-linearity in the time dimension while measuring the similarity, and the find patterns more accurately and speedily from temporal and spatial contexts. Experiment on the real world movie data set LDOS-CoMoDa demonstrates the efficacy and promising utility of the proposed personalized RecSys architecture."
