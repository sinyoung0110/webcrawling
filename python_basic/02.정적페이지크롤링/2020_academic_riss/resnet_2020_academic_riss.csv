In particular, there is little data on fire detection in underground utility facilities, which have poor light conditions and many objects similar to fire. These make fire detection challenging and cause low performance of deep learning models. Therefore, this study proposed a fire detection model using deep learning and estimated the performance of the model. The proposed model was designed using a combination of a basic convolutional neural network, Inception block of GoogleNet, and Skip connection of ResNet to optimize the deep learning model for fire detection under underground utility facilities. In addition, a training technique for the model was proposed. To examine the effectiveness of the method, the trained model was applied to fire images, which included fire and non-fire (which can be misunderstood as a fire) objects under the underground facilities or similar conditions, and results were analyzed. Metrics, such as precision and recall from deep learning models of other studies, were compared with those of the proposed model to estimate the model performance qualitatively. The results showed that the proposed model has high precision and recall for fire detection under low light intensity and both low erroneous and missing detection capabilities for things similar to fire."

However, high inference accuracy of such DNNs comes at high computational costs, and, hence, there have been significant efforts to reduce computational overheads of DNNs either by compressing off-the-shelf models or by designing a new small footprint DNN architecture tailored to resource constrained devices. One notable recent paradigm in designing small footprint DNN models is sharing parameters in several layers. However, in previous approaches, the parameter-sharing techniques have been applied to large deep networks, such as ResNet, that are known to have high redundancy.

In our approach, small templates are combined with small layer-specific parameters to generate weights. Our experiment results on ImageNet and CIFAR100 datasets show that our approach can reduce the size of parameters by 15%-35% of ShuffleNetV2 while achieving smaller drops in accuracies compared to previous parameter-sharing and pruning approaches. We further show that the proposed approach is efficient in terms of latency and energy consumption on modern embedded devices."

For this reason, import reports are consigned to customs officials, who are customs experts, while paying a substantial fee. The purpose of this study is to classify HS items to be reported upon import declaration and to indicate HS codes to be recorded on import declaration. HS items were classified using the attached image in the case of item classification based on the case of the classification of items by the Korea Customs Service for classification of HS items. For image classification, CNN was used as a deep learning algorithm commonly used for image recognition and Vgg16, Vgg19, ResNet50 and Inception-V3 models were used among CNN models. To improve classification accuracy, two datasets were created. Dataset1 selected five types with the most HS code images, and Dataset2 was tested by dividing them into five types with 87 Chapter, the most among HS code 2 units.

YOLO has shown the best quality for real-time object detection due to its fast speed by replacing iterative object detection with once regression for an input image. However, the YOLO utilizes the conventional DCNN (deep convolutional neural network) algorithm to extract features from images thus, detection performance of the YOLO depends on the DCNN utilized. Therefore, we evaluate the object detection performance by changing the feature extraction layers of YOLOv2 with AlexNet, VGG19, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50 to find the best combination DCNN model for YOLO on the six bees above. The comparison results are as follows. In terms of the speed of detection and classification, the model in which YOLOv2 is combined with the AlexNet as a feature extraction layer showed the highest detection speed per second.

Since these missing data adversely affect the results of seismic data processing and analysis, we need to reconstruct the missing data before subsequent processing. However, there are economic and temporal burdens to conducting further exploration and reconstructing missing parts. Many researchers have been studying interpolation methods to accurately reconstruct missing data. Recently, various machine learning technologies such as support vector regression, autoencoder, U-Net, ResNet, and generative adversarial network (GAN) have been applied in seismic data interpolation. In this study, by reviewing these studies, we found that not only neural network models, but also support vector regression models that have relatively simple structures can interpolate missing parts of seismic data effectively.We expect that future research can improve the interpolation performance of these machine learning models by using open-source field data, data augmentation, transfer learning, and regularization based on conventional interpolation technologies."

Web Crawling기법과 요양병원으로부터 지원을 받아 기초데이터를 수집하였다. 이후 Image Generator와 Labeling으로 모델 학습 데이터를 만들었다. CCTV의 제한된 성능 때문에 높은 정확도와 속도를 모두 갖춘 모델을 만드는 것은 어려웠다. 그러므로 정확성이 상대적으로 우수한 ResNet 모델, 속도에서 상대적으로 우수한 YOLO3 모델을 각각 구현했다. 그리고 요양병원이 자신의 실정에 맞는 모델을 고를 수 있게 하고자 했다. 연구 결과 환자복과 평상복을 적절한 정확도로 구별할 수 있는 모델을 구현하였다. 따라서 실제 사용처에서 노인들이 위험구역에 접근하지 못하도록 하여 요양병원 안전사고 감소에 이바지 할 것으로 평가된다.","The purpose of this paper is to reduce the ratio of the patient accidents that may occur in nursing hospitals. In other words, it determines whether the person approaching the dangerous area is a elderly (patient uniform) group or a practitioner(Casual Clothing) group, based on the clothing displayed by CCTV. We collected the basic learning data from web crawling techniques and nursing hospitals. Then model training data was created with Image Generator and Labeling program. Due to the limited performance of CCTV, it is difficult to create a good model with both high accuracy and speed. Therefore, we implemented the ResNet model with relatively excellent accuracy and the YOLO3 model with relatively excellent speed. Then we wanted to allow nursing hospitals to choose a model that they wanted. As a result of the study, we implemented a model that can distinguish patient and casual clothes with appropriate accuracy. Therefore, it is believed that it will contribute to the reduction of safety accidents in nursing hospitals by preventing the elderly from accessing the danger zone."

In this paper, augmented tongue image datasets were developed using seven augmentation techniques such as image cropping, rotation, flipping，color transformations. Performance of the data augmentation techniques were studied using state-of-the-art transfer learning models, for instance, InceptionV3, EfficientNet, ResNet, DenseNet and etc. Our results show that geometric transformations can lead to more performance gains than color transformations and the segmentation accuracy can be increased by 5% to 20% compared with no augmentation. Furthermore, a random linear combination of geometric and color transformations augmentation dataset gives the superior segmentation performance than all other datasets and results in a better accuracy of 94.98% with InceptionV3 models."

Experiment on Intermediate Feature Coding for Object Detection and Segmentation,2020,"['Deep learning', 'intermediate features', 'video coding for machine', 'object detection', 'object segmentation']",,"With the recent development of deep learning, most computer vision-related tasks are being solved with deep learning-based network technologies such as CNN and RNN. Computer vision tasks such as object detection or object segmentation use intermediate features extracted from the same backbone such as Resnet or FPN for training and inference for object detection and segmentation. In this paper, an experiment was conducted to find out the compression efficiency and the effect of encoding on task inference performance when the features extracted in the intermediate stage of CNN are encoded. The feature map that combines the features of 256 channels into one image and the original image were encoded in HEVC to compare and analyze the inference performance for object detection and segmentation. Since the intermediate feature map encodes the five levels of feature maps (P2 to P6), the image size and resolution are increased compared to the original image. However, when the degree of compression is weakened, the use of feature maps yields similar or better inference results to the inference performance of the original image."

First, as input data, we use 128 modified Mel-scale filter banks which can reduce computational burden instead of 512 frequency bins. Mel-scale aims to mimic the non-linear human ear perception of sound by being more discriminative at lower frequencies and less discriminative at higher frequencies. Therefore, Mel-scale is the suitable feature considering both performance and computing power because our proposed network focuses on speech signals. Second, we add a simple ResNet as pre-processing that helps our proposed network make estimated speech signals clear and suppress high-frequency noises. Finally, the proposed U-Net model shows significant performance regardless of the kinds of noise. Especially, despite using a single channel, we confirmed that it can well deal with non-stationary noises whose frequency properties are dynamically changed, and it is possible to estimate speech signals from noisy speech signals even in extremely noisy environments where noises are much lauder than speech (less than SNR 0dB).The performance on our proposed wav-U-Net was improved by about 200% on SDR and 460% on NSDR compared to the conventional Jansson’s wav-U-Net. Also, it was confirmed that the processing time of out wav-U-Net with 128 modified Mel-scale filter banks was about 2.7 times faster than the common wav-U-Net with 512 frequency bins as input values."

In this work, to improve the classification performance, we employ key frames which represent the overall video, as the input of the classification network. The key frames are extracted by SegNet instead of conventional clustering algorithms for video summarization (VSUMM) which require heavy computation. By using a deep neural network, key frame selection can be performed in a real-time system. Experiments are conducted using 3D convolutional kernels such as 3D_CNN, Inflated 3D_CNN (I3D) and 3D_ResNet for gesture classification. Our algorithm achieved up to 97.8% of classification accuracy on the Cambridge gesture dataset.
