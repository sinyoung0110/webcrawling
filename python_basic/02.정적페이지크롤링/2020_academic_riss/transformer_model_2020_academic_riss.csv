다중 인코더 Transformer 기반 번역문 자동 사후 교정 모델의 디코더 주의 구조 연구,2020,"['machine translation', 'automatic post-editing', 'transformer', 'multi-encoder architecture', 'attention mechanism', '기계 번역', '번역문 자동 사후 교정', '트랜스포머', '다중 인코더 구조', '주의 집중 기법']","번역문 자동 사후 교정은 기계 번역 시스템의 결과물을 자동으로 교정하여 더 나은 번역문을 만들어내는 과정으로, 기계 번역 시스템 외적으로 기계 번역의 품질 향상을 수행하기 위해 제안된 연구 분야이다. 본 논문에서는 번역문 자동 사후 교정 문제에 사용되는 다중 인코더 Transformer 기반 교정 모델의 기본 구조를 살펴본 뒤, 디코더에서 인코더 출력과의 상호 의존성을 담당하는 주의 구조를 다양하게 구성하고 적용해 보았다. WMT18 사후 교정 말뭉치를 이용한 실험에서는 다중 인코더 Transformer를 이용한 모델 전부가 기계 번역 시스템의 결과물에 비해 더 나은 품질의 문장을 생성하였으며, 디코더 내에 번역문에 원문의 문맥 정보를 반영하는 구조를 적용하는 것이 사후 교정의 성능 향상에 크게 기여함을 확인할 수 있었다.","Automatic Post-Editing (APE) is a study on the correction for the output of machine translation (MT) system for the purpose of improving its translation quality independent of the MT system itself. In this paper, we examine the basic architecture of a multi-encoder transformer-based APE model, and implement several variants of the system’s encoder-decoder attention layer which takes the outputs of the multi-encoder as its inputs. In experiments with the WMT18 APE data, all variations on our model successfully improve the translation quality of the original MT outputs. In particular, we find modeling the attention to incorporate source sentence context into the translated sentence improves post-editing performance."
The Impact of Transforming Unstructured Data into Structured Data on a Churn Prediction Model for Loan Customers,2020,"['Churn Prediction Model', 'Text Mining', 'Unstructured Data', 'Voice of Customer', 'Convolutional Neural Network']",,"With various structured data, such as the company size, loan balance, and savings accounts, the voice of customer (VOC), which is text data containing contact history and counseling details was analyzed in this study. To analyze unstructured data, the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) analysis, semantic network analysis, sentiment analysis, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) were implemented. A performance comparison of the models revealed that the predictive model using the CNN provided the best performance with regard to predictive power, followed by the model using the TF-IDF, and then the model using semantic network analysis. In particular, a character-level CNN and a word-level CNN were developed separately, and the character-level CNN exhibited better performance, according to an analysis for the Korean language. Moreover, a systematic selection model for optimal text mining techniques was proposed, suggesting which analytical technique is appropriate for analyzing text data depending on the context. This study also provides evidence that the results of previous studies, indicating that individual customers leave when their loyalty and switching cost are low, are also applicable to corporate customers and suggests that VOC data indicating customers’ needs are very effective for predicting their behavior."
Mean-Var Investment Portfolio Optimization Under Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) with Nerlove Transformation: An Empirical Study Using Time Series Approach,2020,"['ARMA-GARCH Models', 'CAPM Regression', 'Nerlove Transformation', 'Investment Portfolio', 'Mean-VaR Model', '.']",,"This paper discusses the problems of Mean-VaR investment portfolio optimization under the Capital Asset Pricing Model with Nerlove transformation by using a time series approach. It assumed that the market return follows the pattern of the time series, whereas stocks return analyzed following the pattern of capital asset pricing models with Nerlove transformation. So that the mean of the market return can be estimated by using the model of Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), while volatility can be estimated using a model of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH). As a risk-free asset here used the interest rate of Indonesia Bank (BI rate), together with the market return is used to estimate the CAPM regression equation for each stock analyzed. Based on the estimator of the CAPM regression equation is used to estimate the mean and variance of the return value of each stock. Estimator mean and the variance value of each stock, as well as the estimator value of the covariance between the stocks, will be used for investment portfolio optimization process. Investment portfolio optimization process is based on a model of Mean-VaR by risk tolerance factor. The goal is to determine the weight composition of the optimum of the investment portfolio. Based on the optimization process was obtained the composition weight of investment portfolio optimum. This composition weight can be taken into consideration in decision making for investors to invest in particular on the assets that were analyzed here."
Model of Consumer Behavior during the Digital Transformation of the Economy,2020,"['Digital Transformation', 'Consumer Behavior', 'Digital Consumer', 'Digital Consumption Ecosystem', 'Digital Consumption Culture', 'Digital Behavior', 'Lean Consumption']",,"This article explores the factors that influence consumer behavior under the conditions of technological changes and the accompanying social and economic externalities. The research goals were to develop a theory of consumer behavior and, based on such a theory, to consider a conceptual model of a digital consumer behavior during digital transformation. The authors systematized the theoretical approaches to understanding the models of consumer behavior and proposed to supplement the existing groups of models with incremental factors, which are caused by the impact of digitalization on society. Within this approach, network interaction algorithms can accurately predict the needs of each individual and suggest the most optimal way of meeting them. The authors developed a conceptual model of consumer behavior. In this model, on the one hand, the digital consumers are at the center of their own digital ecosystems tailored to their specific needs. On the other hand, using certain elements of the digital environment, they create digital footprints that are useful for other participants in the socioeconomic system. Considering this phenomenon allowed the authors to formulate and describe the social and economic externalities generated by the digitalization of consumption and include these in the proposed conceptual model of consumer behavior. Moreover, the authors studied the relationship between the use of digital technology and the socioeconomic development of countries. These countries were divided into clusters with different relationships between particular social parameters and varying levels of digital consumption. Having examined the dynamics of consumer price indices for certain groups of goods in the Russian Federation, the authors propose the hypothesis about the specifics of the digital consumption culture, which reduce both the transactional and direct costs for the consumer."
A Study on the Effect of Transformation Leadership on the Job Performance of Employees by AMO Model,2020,"['변혁형 리더십', '내재적 동기', '자기 효능', '팀 분위기', '작업 성과', 'AMO 이론', 'Transformational leadership', 'Intrinsic motivation', 'Self-efficacy', 'Team atmosphere', 'Job performance', 'AMO theory']",,"This paper analyzed leadership behavior and employee performance through empirical analysis method based on AMO theory.

Signal Transformed Internal Model Control for Non-raster Scanning of Piezo-actuated Nanopositioning Stages,2020,"['Internal model control', 'nanopositioning stage', 'non-raster scanning', 'signal transformed method.']",,"This paper proposes a new signal transformed internal model control (STIMC) scheme for non-raster scanning patterns of piezo-actuated nanopositioning stages. To smooth the scanning signals superimposed with a ramp or time-varying amplitudes, a signal transformation operator is calculated to convert the references into standard harmonic waveforms. An inverse transformation operator is then added in the control loop to generate the driving signals. For the contained internal model control (IMC) design, an H∞ mixed-sensitivity method is utilized for the first order internal mode synthesis. A second and a third internal modes are included in the IMC for alleviating residual high-frequency errors resulted from the nonlinearity of hysteresis. To verify the proposed STIMC scheme, comparative experiments with conventional IMC are conducted based on a nanopositioning platform. Results prove that the STIMC is effective on non-raster signals’ tracking. A same tracking precision for Lissajous scanning can be obtained by STIMC compared with IMC. An improvement of larger than 50% and 80% of root-mean-square errors can be obtained for cycloid and spiral scanning patterns, respectively."
The optimal model of reperfusion injury in vitro using H9c2 transformed cardiac myoblasts,2020,"['Ferroptosis', 'Ischemia', 'Lactic acidosis', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Reperfusion injury']",,"An in vitro model for ischemia/reperfusion injury has not been well-established. We hypothesized that this failure may be caused by serum deprivation, the use of glutamine-containing media, and absence of acidosis. Cell viability of H9c2 cells was significantly decreased by serum deprivation. In this condition, reperfusion damage was not observed even after simulating severe ischemia. However, when cells were cultured under 10% dialyzed FBS, cell viability was less affected compared to cells cultured under serum deprivation and reperfusion damage was observed after hypoxia for 24 h. Reperfusion damage after glucose or glutamine deprivation under hypoxia was not significantly different from that after hypoxia only. However, with both glucose and glutamine deprivation, reperfusion damage was significantly increased. After hypoxia with lactic acidosis, reperfusion damage was comparable with that after hypoxia with glucose and glutamine deprivation. Although highpassage H9c2 cells were more resistant to reperfusion damage than low-passage cells, reperfusion damage was observed especially after hypoxia and acidosis with glucose and glutamine deprivation. Cell death induced by reperfusion after hypoxia with acidosis was not prevented by apoptosis, autophagy, or necroptosis inhibitors, but significantly decreased by ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, and deferoxamine, an iron chelator. These data suggested that in our SIR model, cell death due to reperfusion injury is likely to occur via ferroptosis, which is related with ischemia/reperfusion- induced cell death in vivo. In conclusion, we established an optimal reperfusion injury model, in which ferroptotic cell death occurred by hypoxia and acidosis with or without glucose/glutamine deprivation under 10% dialyzed FBS."
Land Use Feature Extraction and Sprawl Development Prediction from Quickbird Satellite Imagery Using Dempster-Shafer and Land Transformation Model,2020,"['Urban growth prediction', 'remote sensing', 'land transformation model', 'object-based image analysis', 'Dempster-Shafer']",,"Accurate knowledge of land use/land cover (LULC) features and their relative changes over upon the time are essential for sustainable urban management. Urban sprawl growth has been always also a worldwide concern that needs to carefully monitor particularly in a developing country where unplanned building constriction has been expanding at a high rate. Recently, remotely sensed imageries with a very high spatial/spectral resolution and state of the art machine learning approaches sent the urban classification and growth monitoring to a higher level. In this research, we classified the Quickbird satellite imagery by object-based image analysis of Dempster- Shafer (OBIA-DS) for the years of 2002 and 2015 at Karbala-Iraq. The real LULC changes including, residential sprawl expansion, amongst these years, were identified via change detection procedure. In accordance with extracted features of LULC and detected trend of urban pattern, the future LULC dynamic was simulated by using land transformation model (LTM) in geospatial information system (GIS) platform. Both classification and prediction stages were successfully validated using ground control points (GCPs) through accuracy assessment metric of Kappa coefficient that indicated 0.87 and 0.91 for 2002 and 2015 classification as well as 0.79 for prediction part. Detail results revealed a substantial growth in building over fifteen years that mostly replaced by agriculture and orchard field. The prediction scenario of LULC sprawl development for 2030 revealed a substantial decline in green and agriculture land as well as an extensive increment in build-up area especially at the countryside of the city without following the residential pattern standard. The proposed method helps urban decision-makers to identify the detail temporal-spatial growth pattern of highly populated cities like Karbala. Additionally, the results of this study can be considered as a probable future map in order to design enough future social services and amenities for the local inhabitants."

사전학습 언어모델 기반 트랜스포머를 활용한 의미유사도기반 자연어이해 의도파악 방법,2020,"['심층신경망', '자연어이해', '의도분석', '의도파악', '의미유사도', '트랜스포머', 'deep neural network', 'natural language understanding', 'intention analysis', 'semantic similarity', 'transformer']","자연어이해는 로봇, 메신저, 자연어 인터페이스 등에 활용되는 근간 기술 중 하나이다. 본 연구에서는 자연어이해 문제 중 문장의 의도를 파악하는 의도파악기술에 있어, 전통적인 분류기술을 활용하는 것이 아닌, 문장의 의미를 벡터 형태로 가공할 수 있는 문장 및 의미틀 읽기장치를 학습시키고, 훈련문장과 질의문장의 벡터 공간상의 의미거리를 측정하여, 가장 가까운 훈련문장의 의도를 질의문장의 의도로 부착하는 방법을 제안한다. 이를 위해, 사전학습 언어모델 기반 트랜스포머를 활용하여 기호 형태의 문장 및 의미틀을 벡터 형태로 변환하는 방법을 소개한다. 한국어 기반 날씨 및 내비게이션 영역의 말뭉치와 영어 기반 항공교통 예약 영역, 음성 언어 이해 시스템 영역의 자연어 말뭉치등을 활용한 다양한 실험을 통하여 제안한 방법이 성공적으로 의미벡터를 배움을 보이고, 기존 의도파악 기술 대비 높은 성능을 가짐을 보인다.","Natural language understanding (NLU) is a central technique applied to developing robot, smart messenger, and natural interface. In this study, we propose a novel similarity-based intent analysis method instead of the typical classification methods for intent analysis problems in the NLU.To accomplish this, the neural network-based text and semantic frame readers are introduced to learn semantic vectors using pairwise text-semantic frame instances. The text to vector and the semantic frame to vector projection methods using the pre-trained transformer are proposed. Then, we propose a method of attaching the intention tag of the nearest training sentence to the query sentence by measuring the semantic vector distances in the vector space. Four experiments on the natural language learning suggest that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to the existing intention analysis techniques. These four experiments use natural language corpora in Korean and English. The two experiments in Korean are weather and navigation language corpora, and the two English-based experiments involve air travel information systems and voice platform language corpora."
PC-SAN: Pretraining-Based Contextual Self-Attention Model for Topic Essay Generation,2020,"['Natural language generation', 'Essay generation', 'Pretraining-based method', 'Self-attention network', 'Deep learning']",,"Automatic topic essay generation (TEG) is a controllable text generation task that aims to generate informative, diverse, and topic-consistent essays based on multiple topics. To make the generated essays of high quality, a reasonable method should consider both diversity and topic-consistency. Another essential issue is the intrinsic link of the topics, which contributes to making the essays closely surround the semantics of provided topics. However, it remains challenging for TEG to fill the semantic gap between source topic words and target output, and a more powerful model is needed to capture the semantics of given topics. To this end, we propose a pretraining-based contextual self-attention (PC-SAN) model that is built upon the seq2seq framework. For the encoder of our model, we employ a dynamic weight sum of layers from BERT to fully utilize the semantics of topics, which is of great help to fill the gap and improve the quality of the generated essays. In the decoding phase, we also transform the target-side contextual history information into the query layers to alleviate the lack of context in typical self-attention networks (SANs). Experimental results on large-scale paragraph-level Chinese corpora verify that our model is capable of generating diverse, topic-consistent text and essentially makes improvements as compare to strong baselines. Furthermore, extensive analysis validates the effectiveness of contextual embeddings from BERT and contextual history information in SANs."
Numerical Analysis of Surface and Internal Discharge Phenomena at the Interface of Hetero‑Dielectric Composites Based on the Migration–Migration Model,2020,['BCT model · Migration–migration model · Nanocomposites · Surface discharge'],,"Nanocomposites have been actively studied for understanding the superior electrical characteristics and for utilizing in the electric devices of HVDC systems. Nanocomposites in electrical devices are not used unilaterally, but rather as the heterodielectric composites, which form an interface with other insulators. In this study, the hetero-dielectric composites comprised of nanocomposites and transformer oil were analyzed using the migration–migration model incorporating the fnite element method. Until now, hetero-dielectric composites have been usually studied by using the Migration–Ohmic model, where the specifc space charge behavior cannot be analyzed. Although interface conditions are signifcant for the transport and local accumulation of charge, the BCT models, including conditions for interface with other insulators, have not been reported.To investigate the space charge behavior of the hetero-dielectric composites, charge carriers of positive, negative ions and electrons are considered in the liquid region and electrons and holes in the nanocomposites. These hetero-dielectric composites are applied to the needle-bar electrode system to analyze the surface discharge phenomena at the interface. The BCT model was applied to the nanocomposites, and the drift dominated charge continuity model was applied to the transformer oil. These numerical results were compared with those from the previous research works validated with the experimental results. We analyzed the propagation of the streamer with an equivalent parallel current circuit and adopted the efective mobility of the electrons according to the feld strength to improve the applicability of the numerical analysis model."
Model-free Optimal Tracking Control for an Aircraft Skin Inspection Robot with Constrained-input and Input Time-delay via Integral Reinforcement Learning,2020,"['Constrained-input', 'input time-delay', 'model-free', 'reinforcement learning']",,"This paper presents a model-free optimal tracking control algorithm for an aircraft skin inspection robot with constrained-input and input time-delay. To tackle the input time-delay problem, the original system is transformed into a delay-free system with constrained-input and unknown input coupling term. In order to overcome the optimal control problem subject to constrained-input,a discounted value function is employed. In general, it is known that the HJB equation does not admit a classical smooth solution. Moreover, since the input coupling term of the delay-free system is unknown, a model-free integral reinforcement learning(IRL) algorithm which only requires the system sampling data generated by arbitrary different control inputs and external disturbances is proposed. The model-free IRL method is implemented on an actor-critic neural network (NN) structure. A system sampling data set is utilized to learn the value function and control policy. Finally, the simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
Geographical weighted Poisson regression model of pig farm vehicle movements for the 2016 foot and mouth disease epidemics in South Chungcheong,2020,"['Foot and mouth disease', 'spatial autocorrelation', 'Moran’I', 'Getis-Ord G', 'GWPR']",,"This study examined the spatial autocorrelation of the 2016 foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks in South Chungcheong to determine the association between the disease epidemics and pig farm vehicle movements. Two spatial autocorrelation testing methods were used: Moran’s I and Getis-Ord G statistics. The Moran’s I statistic for the FMD outbreak areas was -0.239, and its p-value was less than 0.007. The median Getis-Ord G statistic for the FMD outbreak areas was -0.323. The results indicated that the geographical distribution of the FMD outbreak areas was not spatially homogeneous. The spatial autocorrelation of the 2016 FMD epidemics was considered by applying a geographical weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) model in the analysis, in which pig farm vehicle movements were used as risk factors for the 2016 FMD epidemics. The number of FMD-infected farms per second-level administrative province (si or gun) was used as a dependent variable. The number of farm vehicle movements within the province (within variable), from one province to other provinces (outbound variable), or from other provinces to one province (inbound variable), were included as independent variables in the GWPR model. The results of the GWPR model were as follows. The estimated median coefficient of the log-transformed within variable, the log-transformed outbound variable, and log-transformed inbound variable were -0.000, 0.010, and -0.009, respectively. The optimal bandwidth for the GWPR model was 80.49, and the AIC score was 89.35. The results showed that the GWPR model would provide an understanding of the relationship between the 2016 FMD epidemics and pig farm vehicle movements."
Innovative Surface Merging Method for Generating Point-Based Skin Model Shapes Considering Processing Features,2020,['Processing features · Skin model shape · Computer aided tolerance · Surface reconstruction · Tolerance modeling'],,"Virtual prototypes have been appealing in the early design stage of computer aided tolerancing, because it is less expensive to evaluate and modify tolerances numerically. Derived from the machining processes, form uncertainties are simulated, controlled and analyzed in virtual prototypes using parametric and intuitive surface patches. The generation of a complete virtual prototype often involves combining surface patches with different patterns to one complete model. To overcome possible geometric defects in this process, a surface merging method is proposed in this paper. Skin Model Shapes is first introduced as the geometric foundation. The whole part surface is segmented based on the geometric shape and machining type. Then point-based patches are generated accordingly. Interpolation implicit surfaces based on radial basis function networks are constructed in patch boundaries based on spatial-constrained homogeneous transformation matrices. A feature augmentation process is then introduced to preserve processing features after resampling the blend patch. The proposed method is proved to be efficient in feature retaining as well as surface smoothing, through numerical experiments and analysis on an example mechanical part. The results show that the generated virtual prototype would become 62.5% more smooth while retaining a 91.6% feature similarity after using the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method could preserve 174% more features at a cost of 9.0% smoothness than using a conventional modified trimmed filtering method."
Experimental Investigation on the Force-Crack Quantification Model for HSRC Columns with Flexure-Shear and Shear Failure Modes,2020,"['damage assessment', 'high strength', 'reinforced concrete', 'residual crack']",,"A total of six full-scale high strength reinforced concrete (HSRC) columns were tested under axial and cyclic lateral loading. The specified concrete compressive strength was 70 MPa and the specified yield strength was 685 MPa and 785 MPa for the longitudinal and transverse reinforcements, respectively. The main variables considered in the study are the transverse reinforcements ratio and axial load ratio. Although such HSRC columns have gradually transformed in use and scope, the damage assessment method is less understood. The main purpose of this study is to propose a damage assessment model for HSRC columns. An analytical backbone curve model for predicting force-deformation behavior of HSRC columns is described. Column stiffness is also measured from the experiment to obtain stiffness reduction factors that are necessary to calculate member deformation. Based on experiment results, a new limiting value of residual crack width is defined to determine damage level. This study uses specified residual crack width of 0.15 mm, 0.30 mm, and 1.00 mm in the damage assessment model. The new limiting value of residual crack width is also used to determine the performance points of structural members. Finally, a new drift ratio limit of each damage level is also proposed. Experiment results are presented and used to investigate the application of the proposed damage assessment model."
An analytical approach of behavior change for concrete dam by  panel data model,2020,"['panel', 'concrete dam', 'behavior variation', 'data model', 'conversion time and location']",,"The behavior variation of concrete dam is investigated, based on a new method for analyzing the data model of concrete dam in service process for the limitation of wavelet transform for solving concrete dam service process model. The study takes into account the time and position of behavior change during the process of concrete dam service. There is no dependence on the effect quantity for overcoming the shortcomings of the traditional identification method. The panel data model is firstly proposed for analyzing the behavior change of composite concrete dam. The change-point theory is used to identify whether the behavior of concrete dams changes during service. The phase space reconstruction technique is used to reconstruct the phase plane of the trend effect component. The time dimension method is used to solve the construction of multi-transformation model of composite panel data. An existing 76.3-m-high dam is used to investigate some key issues on the behavior change. Emphasis is placed on conversion time and location for three time periods consistent with the practical analysis report for evaluating the validity of the analysis method of the behavior variation of concrete dams presented in this paper."

Erectile function was accessed using maximum intracavernous pressure (ICP) and ICP/mean arterial pressure (MAP). Molecular changes were examined by western blot analysis using hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) antibodies. Collagen change was evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining.Results: In vivo measurements of ICP and ICP/MAP in Group II were significantly lower than those in Group I (p<0.01).Smooth muscle/collagen ratio in Group II was significantly lower than that in Group I (p<0.05). After treatment with mirodenafil for four weeks, Group III showed significantly higher levels of ICP and ICP/MAP than Group II (p<0.05). Western blot analysis showed that HIF-1α and TGF-β1 levels were significantly higher in Group II whereas eNOS levels were significantly lower in Group II than those in Group I or III.Conclusions: A novel arteriogenic ED with AS model is successfully induced by CPI and validated based on molecular and histologic evidences."
Iso-material contour representation for process planning of heterogeneous object model,2020,"['heterogeneous object modeling', 'medial axis transform', 'iso-material contours', 'material features']",,"Additive manufacturing is emerging as the preferred process for making heterogeneous objects. Planning the deposition of material is more complex for heterogeneous objects as the material variation has to be tracked along the path. This paper proposes an iso-material contour representation to generate the process plan for additive manufacturing given a smooth representation of heterogeneous object model. These contours represent the iso-material paths for deposition. As these paths shift along the direction of the gradation of material distribution, the deposition respects the gradient of the designed material distribution unlike iso-oriented paths generated by a raster scan method. Since the paths have the same material composition, material frequent change in the material composition is avoided, which, in turn, avoids the uneven deposition caused by the frequent start and stop of deposition while the material is being changed along the paths generated by the traditional raster scan. Associativity between the contours and the corresponding designed material feature is maintained, and therefore, changes in material composition are automatically propagated to the process plan."

It can also play an important role in data augmentation for speech recognition. The conventional method uses the architecture of voice conversion with speech synthesis, with Mel filter bank as the main parameter. Mel filter bank is well-suited for quick computation of neural networks but cannot be converted into a high-quality waveform without the aid of a vocoder. Further, it is not effective in terms of obtaining data for speech recognition. In this paper, we focus on performing voice-to-voice conversion using only the raw spectrum. We propose a deep learning model based on the transformer network, which quickly learns the voice conversion properties using an attention mechanism between source and target spectral components. The experiments were performed on TIDIGITS data, a series of numbers spoken by an English speaker. The conversion voices were evaluated for naturalness and similarity using mean opinion score (MOS) obtained from 30 participants. Our final results yielded 3.52±0.22 for naturalness and 3.89±0.19 for similarity."
Circuit Model for the Effect of Nonradiative Recombination in a High-Speed Distributed-Feedback Laser,2020,"['Chirp characteristics', 'Distributed feedback laser', 'Equivalent circuit model', 'Nonradiative recombination', 'Rate equations']",,"Based on single-mode rate equations, we present an improved equivalent-circuit model for distributedfeedback (DFB) lasers that accounts for the effects of parasitic parameters and nonradiative recombination.This equivalent-circuit model is composed of a parasitic circuit, an electrical circuit, an optical circuit, and a phase circuit, modeling the circuit equations transformed from the rate equations. The validity of the proposed circuit model is verified by comparing simulation results to measured results in the literature.The results show that the slope efficiency and threshold current of the model are 0.22 W/A and 13 mA respectively. It is also shown that increasing bias current results in the increase of the relaxation-oscillation frequency. Moreover, we show that the larger the bias current, the lower the frequency chirp, increasing the possibility of extending the transmission distance of an optical-fiber communication system. The results indicate that the proposed circuit model can accurately predict a DFB laser’s static and dynamic characteristics."

In order to solve the problems that the real-time estimation of the lithium-ion battery is difficult and the estimation accuracy is not high under various working conditions, a lithium-ion battery is taken as a research object, and the working characteristics of the lithium-ion battery are studied under various working conditions. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the traditional unscented Kalman algorithm, an improved unscented Kalman algorithm is proposed. Considering the importance of accurately estimating the initial state of charge for later estimation, the initial estimation value is calibrated by using the open-circuit voltage method.

In the analysis based on the proposed model, the nonlocality is taken into account in both heat conduction and elasticity. The governing equations including the equations of motion and the energy balance equation are derived using the proposed model in a nano beam resonator. An analytical solution is proposed for the problem using the Laplace transform technique and Talbot technique for inversion to time domain. It is assumed that the nano beam is subjected to sinusoidal thermal shock loading, which is applied on the one of beam ends. The transient behaviors of fields’ quantities such as lateral deflection and temperature are studied in detail. Also, the effects of small scale parameter on the dynamic behaviors of lateral deflection and temperature are obtained and assessed for the problem.

Simulating spatial–temporal urban growth of a Moroccan metropolitan using CA–Markov model,2020,"['Urban sprawl', 'CA–Markov model', 'Spatial metrics', 'Simulation and forecasting', 'MLP', 'El Jadida city']",,"The continuous urban expansion is one of the most important problems in urban development due to its negative societal and environmental impacts. This study encompasses the spatial–temporal of land use/cover change (LUCC) monitoring (1999–2018) and urban growth modelling (2010–2040) of El Jadida city, Morocco. For this purpose, Landsat-7 ETM and Landsat-8 OLI images combined with a Cellular Automata–Markov (CA–Markov) model were used to simulate and forecast LUCC. The characteristics of LUCC were discussed based on the land cover maps along with urban gradient analysis. After understanding the spatial–temporal patterns of LUCC, the CA–Markov and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model were employed using the historical land cover maps and other auxiliary data to simulate and forecast LUCC. The results showed that the urban area (built-up) increased with 19.8 km2. The rapid urbanization has replaced and transform bare soil (net loss 12.7 km2) followed by vegetation cover (net loss 7.1 km2) during 1999–2018. The result exhibited that the predominant built-up development was observed in south-west followed by south-east direction majorly within the municipal limits. The projected LULC exhibit that the built-up area will increase from 29.9 to 43.8 km2 with an average annual growth rate of 0.63, primarily in western and eastern parts during 2018–2040. The result for year 2040 with reasonably good accuracy will be useful to the planners, policy and decision makers. Therefore, the protection measures for environment should be set in advance according to the forecasting results of this study."

It always produces complete division of the image as the specific demand. However, it is prone to over-segmentation which makes the result unfavorable. Therefore, this paper proposes modified watershed algorithm based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to reduce the over-segmentation. Distance transformed image is processed by GMM. And expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to fit GMM to data. Average of these means is chosen as optimal threshold and the image is converted into binary image based on the obtained threshold value. Binary image thus obtained is eroded with the help of proper structuring element. Watershed segmentation thus carried out on the eroded image gives the effective segmentation results. Different kernels such as corn, rice, and wheat are effectively segmented when the proposed methodology is used. 38 corn kernels, 95 rice kernels, and 32 wheat kernels are used for the experimental purpose. The accuracy of segmentation is as high as 94.7%, 96.8%, and 90.6% for corn, rice, and wheat respectively."

In this paper, we propose a novel automated method called adaptive slope of wavelet coefficient counts over various thresholds (ASCOT) to classify patient episodes as seizure waveforms. ASCOT involves extracting the feature matrix by calculating the mean slope of wavelet coefficient counts over various thresholds in each frequency subband. We validated our method using our own database and a public database to avoid overtuning. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved a reliable and promising accuracy in both our own database (98.93%) and the public database (99.78%). Finally, we evaluated the performance of the method considering various window sizes. In conclusion, the proposed method achieved a reliable seizure detection performance with a short-term window size. Therefore, our method can be utilized to interpret long-term EEG results and detect momentary seizure waveforms in diagnostic systems."

"Vactosertib, a Novel, Orally Bioavailable Activin Receptor-Like Kinase 5 Inhibitor, Promotes Regression of Fibrotic Plaques in a Rat Model of Peyronie’s Disease",2020,"['Activin receptors', 'Fibrosis', 'Peyronie’s disease', 'Transforming growth factor beta']",,"Purpose: To examine the therapeutic effect of Vactosertib, a small molecule inhibitor of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) type I receptor (activin receptor-like kinase-5, ALK5), in an experimental model of Peyronie’s disease (PD) and determining anti-fibrotic mechanisms of Vactosertib in primary fibroblasts derived from human PD plaques.Materials and Methods: Male rats were randomly divided into three groups (n=6 per group); control rats without treatment; PD rats receiving vehicle; and PD rats receiving Vactosertib (10 mg/kg). PD-like plaques were induced by administering 100 μL of each of human fibrin and thrombin solutions into the tunica albuginea on days 0 and 5. Vactosertib was given orally five times a week for 2 weeks. On day 30, we performed electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve to measure erectile function, and the penis was obtained for histological examination. Fibroblasts isolated from human PD plaques were used to determine the anti-fibrotic effects of Vactosertib in vitro.Results: Vactosertib induced significant regression of fibrotic plaques in PD rats in vivo through reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells and reduced expression of phospho-Smad2, which recovered erectile function. Vactosertib also abrogated TGF- β1-induced enhancement of extracellular matrix protein production and hydroxyproline content in PD fibroblasts in vitro by hindering the TGF-β1-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation.Conclusions: In view of the critical role of TGF-β and the Smad pathway in the pathogenesis of PD, inhibition of this pathway with an ALK5 inhibitor may represent a novel, targeted therapy for PD."
Selective adsorption of Cs<sup>+</sup> by MXene (Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>) from model low-level radioactive wastewater,2020,"['Radioactive cesium', 'Mechanism', 'Adsorption', 'MXene']",,"This study explored whether MXene (Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>) could remove radioactive Cs<sup>+</sup> from model nuclear wastewater. Various adsorption tests were performed and the physical aspects of the interaction were investigated. We varied the MXene dosage, Cs<sup>+</sup> initial concentration, solution pH, solution temperature and exposure time. MXene adsorption exhibited very fast kinetics, based on the fact that equilibrium was achieved within 1 h. MXene exhibited an outstanding adsorption capacity (148 mg g<sup>-1</sup>) at adsorbent and adsorbate concentrations of 5 and 2 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, at neutral pH condition (i.e., pH 7). We explored Cs<sup>+</sup> adsorption by MXene in the presence of four different ions (NaCl, KCl, CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and three different organic acids (sodium oleate, oxalic acid, and citric acid). The Cs<sup>+</sup> removal rate changed in the presence of these components; adsorption of Cs<sup>+</sup> by MXene thus involved ion exchange, supported by both Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We confirmed that MXene was re-usable for at least four cycles. MXene is cost-effective and practical when used to adsorb radionuclides (e.g., Cs<sup>+</sup>) in nuclear wastewater."
Impact of instream sand mining on habitat destruction or transformation using coupling models of HSI and MLR,2020,['Instream sand mining River ecosystem Habitat degradation Alteration Habitat suitability'],,"Several human activities like sand mining, dam construction have intensive effect on river ecosystem.Instream sand mining is one of them to hindrance on riverine biota. Hence, an attempt is made in this study to assess three tier habitat degradation or alteration caused by instream sand mining from channel bed to riparian and bank site in upper, middle and lower segments of Kangsabati River. Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) is applied to detect geo referenced ecological information on two different condition i.e. habitat suitability of two dominating species of Koeleria macrantha and Cynodon dactylon (pre mining) and degraded or altered habitat incorporated with mining responses (post mining). HSI prepared five different suitable class taken seven dominating variables i.e.river channel, sandchar, riparian zone, slope, elevation, dry and moist sand layer using multiple logistic regressions (MLR) under GIS platform. MLR denotes sandchar deposition, elevation as significant variables of Koeleriamacrantha dominance along the bank while moist sand layer, riparian zone signified on Cynodondactylon dominance across the riparian site. HSI indicates lowsuitable class of Koeleriamacrantha and Cynodondactylon dominated in largest sand mining area as lower (82%, 86%), middle (58%, 89%) and upper segment (77%, 78%) whereas largest mining area under two dominant species reaches low-suitable class as lower (79%, 58%), middle (89%, 82%) and upper segment (92%, 70%) respectively.In spite of variables influence on species dominance, massive sand mining leads to destroy the habitat suitability.Therefore, in situ habitat suitability of dominant species either degraded or altered throughout the channel."

Besides, the architecture has a regularizing effect on the learning process between segmentation and classification. Our model was evaluated on the Chonnam National University Hospital dataset and achieved good performance compared to other methods."
Antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of Korean ginseng extract GS-KG9 in a D-galactosamine-induced liver damage animal model,2020,"['Panax ginseng', 'liver', 'galactosamine', 'oxidative stress', 'liver fibrosis']",,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate the improvement effect of white ginseng extract (GS-KG9) on D-galactosamine (Ga1N)-induced oxidative stress and liver injury.SUBJECTS/METHODS: Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups. Rats were orally administrated with GS-KG9 (300, 500, or 700 mg/kg) or silymarin (25 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. The rats of the GS-KG9- and silymarin-treated groups and a control group were then intraperitoneally injected Ga1N at a concentration of 650 mg/kg for 4 days. To investigate the protective effect of GS-KG9 against GalN-induced liver injury, blood liver function indicators, anti-oxidative stress indicators, and histopathological features were analyzed.RESULTS: Serum biochemical analysis indicated that GS-KG9 ameliorated the elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in GalN-treated rats. The hepatoprotective effects of GS-KG9 involved enhancing components of the hepatic antioxidant defense system, including glutathione, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). In addition, GS-KG9 treatment inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by GalN treatment in hepatocytes and significantly increased the expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) proteins, which are antioxidant proteins. In particular, by histological analyses bases on hematoxylin and eosin, Masson""s trichrome, α-smooth muscle actin, and transforming growth factor-β1 staining, we determined that the administration of 500 mg/kg GS-KG9 inhibited hepatic inflammation and fibrosis due to the excessive accumulation of collagen.CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that GS-KG9 improves GalN-induced liver inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis by attenuating oxidative stress. Therefore, GS-KG9 may be considered a useful candidate in the development of a natural preventive agent against liver injury."
Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Agonist Attenuates Liver Fibrosis by Several Fibrogenic Pathways in an Animal Model of Cholestatic Fibrosis,2020,"['Peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma', 'Liver cirrhosis', 'Hepatic stellate cell', 'Connective tissue growth factor', 'Platelet-derived growth factor', 'Transforming growth factor beta1']",,"Purpose: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) has a key role in hepatic fibrogenesis by virtue of its effect on the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Although many studies have shown that PPAR-γ agonists inhibit liver fibrosis, the mechanism remains largely unclear, especially regarding the cross-talk between PPAR-γ and other potent fibrogenic factors. Methods: This experimental study involved 25 male Wistar rats. Twenty rats were subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) to induce liver fibrosis, further divided into an untreated group (BDL; n=10) and a group treated with the PPAR-γ agonist thiazolidinedione (TZD), at 14 days post-operation (BDL+TZD; n=10). The remaining 5 rats had a sham operation (sham; n=5). The effect of PPAR-γ agonist on liver fibrosis was evaluated by histopathology, protein immunohistochemistry, and mRNA expression quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Histology and immunostaining showed markedly reduced collagen deposition, bile duct proliferation, and HSCs in the BDL+TZD group compared to those in the BDL group (p<0.001). Similarly, significantly lower mRNA expression of collagen α-1(I), matrix metalloproteinase-2, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B chain, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were evident in the BDL+TZD group compared to those in the BDL group (p=0.0002, p<0.035, p<0.0001, and p=0.0123 respectively). Moreover, expression of the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) was also downregulated in the BDL+TZD group (p=0.0087). Conclusion: The PPAR-γ agonist inhibits HSC activation in vivo and attenuates liver fibrosis through several fibrogenic pathways. Potent fibrogenic factors such as PDGF, CTGF, and TGF-β1 were downregulated by the PPAR-γ agonist. Targeting PPAR-γ activity may be a potential strategy to control liver fibrosis."

Variables affecting the use of building energy include the identification of environmental conditions, historical conditions, and schedule conditions, and these factors have a sophisticated effect on buildings. One of the most influential variables is the building schedule. Because each building has its own schedule, standardized schedules cannot be applied to various buildings, and it is difficult for non-experts to analyze or predict schedules in these cases. The aim of this paper is to propose a high-precision building energy demand prediction model by using a Fourier transform-based time series prediction model, that automatically analyzes and predicts the schedule to be applied when predicting building energy demand. In order to compare with the existing method, the six buildings are divided into schedules when they are not scheduled, weekdays/weekends, days of week and when schedule analysis algorithm are applied. Machine learning is performed using the LSTM model, and prediction accuracy is verified through the CvRMSE and MBE. There was an average difference of 15.37% based on the CvRMSE, and all predictions were predictable when the automated prediction model was applied. This study can be used as a building energy operation plan for the creation and implementation of a future energy-efficient smart grid system."

The anabaptist is a representative group of separation models among the five models classified by Richard Niebuhr. John Yoder argues that the separation model is a powerful society transformation model. The model seeks distinction, not separation from the world, and an alternative way of life that clearly contrasts with the world. Furthermore, Yoder criticizes the frame of ‘responsibility versus irresponsibility’ as unrealistic and ambiguous. Instead, he proposes a frame of ‘faithfulness versus unfaithfulness.’ Thus, we are not a debate about to fulfill social responsibilities, but rather how to participate specifically."

BERT는 대용량의 학습데이터를 이용하여 미리 학습시켜 놓은 언어 표현 모델이다. 디코더에는 주의 메커니즘과 복사 메커니즘을 도입하였다. 인코더와 디코더에서의 처리 단위는 각각 어절 단위 WordPiece와 형태소 단위의 WordPiece를 사용하였다. 실험을 통해, BERT의 파라미터를 문제에 맞게 재조정했을 때의 성능이 Transformer를 임의의 값으로 초기화하여 사용했을 때에 비해 F1에서 2.9%의 성능 향상을 보임을 알 수 있었다. 또한 학습단계에서 충분히 학습되지 못한 WordPiece의 임베딩이 형태소 분석에 어떤 영향을 미치는지도 살펴보았다.","This paper introduces a Korean morphological analyzer using the Transformer, which is one of the most popular sequence-to-sequence deep neural models. The Transformer comprises an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses a raw input sentence into a fixed-size vector, while the decoder generates a morphological analysis result for the vector. We also replace the encoder with BERT, a pre-trained language representation model. An attention mechanism and a copying mechanism are integrated in the decoder. The processing units of the encoder and the decoder are eojeol-based WordPiece and morpheme-based WordPiece, respectively. Experimental results showed that the Transformer with fine-tuned BERT outperforms the randomly initialized Transformer by 2.9% in the F1 score. We also investigated the effects of the WordPiece embedding on morphological analysis when they are not fully updated in the training phases."

Method: This study collected and analyzed academic papers, books, and research reports as domestic and foreign precedent studies through literature research methods, recognized the importance of discussion and debate classes at school, and applied Foucault s epistemology and Parrhesia s practice emphasized by him theoretically and methodically to explore strategies for new discussion and debate models. Results: First, the discussion and debate process in school education was an educational activity that has important meanings in student subjectivity, transformational competence, and realization of equity. Second, in devising the improved discussion and debate model based on critical reflection on the limitations of democracy, rationality, and objectivity emphasized in the existing educational situation and environment, Foucault s epistemology and the theoretical and methodology of Practice of Parrhesia emphasized by him were very suggestive and meaningful. Third, in order to secure discussion and debate process to activate the practice of Parrhesia, it is necessary to establish a public opinion field that can guarantee the safety according to the statement so that any opinion is rejected or criticized. Conclusion: It is necessary to improve both external and internal factors for the new discussion and debate class model in a balanced manner by providing all the participants with psychological safety and confidence that can shake off the fear of rejection and criticism. Especially, for the discussion and debate classes based on Foucault s Parrhesia, it is emphasized that the dialogue maxim for the practice of free speech needs to be newly reconstructed."

The undesirable natural-velocity-feedback effect is discussed by introducing mechanical impedance into the electro-hydraulic actuation system. The proposed model-free torque control comprises inner- and outer-loop control to achieve two control objectives. Inner-loop control reduces the mechanical impedance passively and optimally. To improve the tracking accuracy, a certain form of proportional-integral-derivative control is applied to the outer loop. The robustness of the proposed closed-loop system against external disturbances is demonstrated by transforming the two-loop control structure into a disturbance observer form. The proposed method is validated on a single joint electro-hydraulic actuator."

Here, we investigated whether galunisertib, a potent small-molecule inhibitor of TGFβ receptor I (TβRI), attenuates aneurysmal disease in a murine model of MFS (Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup>) and compared the impact of galuninsertib on the MFSrelated vascular pathogenesis with that of losartan, a prophylactic agent routinely used for patients with MFS. Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice were administered galunisertib or losartan for 8 weeks, and their ascending aortas were assessed for histopathological changes and phosphorylation of Smad2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2). Mice treated with galunisertib or losartan barely exhibited phosphorylated Smad2, suggesting that both drugs effectively blocked overactivated canonical TGFβ signaling in Fbn1<sup>C1039G/+</sup> mice. However, galunisertib treatment did not attenuate disrupted medial wall architecture and only partially decreased Erk1/2 phosphorylation, whereas losartan significantly inhibited MFS-associated aortopathy and markedly decreased Erk1/2 phosphorylation in Fbn1C1039G/+ mice. These data unexpectedly revealed that galunisertib, a TβRI inhibitor, showed no benefits in aneurysmal disease in MFS mice although it completely blocked Smad2 phosphorylation. The significant losartaninduced inhibition of both aortic vascular pathogenesis and Smad2 phosphorylation implied that canonical TGFβ signaling might not prominently drive aneurysmal diseases in MFS mice."

It does not have to be a test-bed to conduct tests in the sites; however, for such demonstrations, usually, sanctions follow, e.g. Blocking the traffic on the roads with frequent vehicle traffic. Thus, this study presents “a underground test-bed,” considering the domestic topographical conditions and various materials, shapes, and arrangements like the present underground utilities. The test-bed presented in this study not only provides a place optimized for the subjects to verify performance of the domestic underground but also presents a measure as a place for verification that can perform mid-to-long-term verification experiment, including the facilities the present underground exploration equipment cannot explore."
"A Fusion of Dreams, a Crossing of Borders: On Ch’oe Inhun’s Transformations of Korean Classical Literature",2020,"['Ch’oe Inhun', 'Korean heritage', 'intellectual dissent', 'Korean literary canon', 'adaptation']",,"This article discusses two adaptations of Korean “classics” by Ch’oe Inhun (1936- 2018), Kuunmong (1962) and Ku˘mo sinhwa (1963), offering an in-depth comparative analysis of these works with their canonized Choso˘n Dynasty models by Kim Manjung (1637-1692) and Kim Sisu˘p (1435-1493) to identify and interpret intertextual ties. I hypothesize that Ch’oe Inhun’s unusual transformations of these core works of the national Korean canon―written in a South Korea churned by internal and external conflicts, during an age when historical and cultural memories were forged and a national heritage and identity designed to legitimize, demarcate, and mobilize were created―constitute narratives of intellectual dissent. This paper argues that Ch’oe Inhun’s adaptations of Kuunmong and Ku˘mo sinhwa, both developing meaning and impact out of the creative interplay with their premodern models, can be understood as having been specifically geared to run counter to policies of simplification, linearization, collectivization, and glorification of tradition brought forth by the government under Park Chung Hee (1917-1979)."

The 《Freiburg FABRIK》 is a living community that transformed Factory, which used to be the workplace of workers, into a place of labor, residence, and restoration and preservation of the ecosystem.However, this community does not only provide free labor and cultural activities for its members, but also provides cultural and artistic programs for the socially disadvantaged in the region to create jobs and help local residents engage in creative activities. It also contributes not only to the community itself but also to the city of Freiburg becoming an energyindependent city. In short, 《Freiburg FABRIK》 is a self-reliant community with free labor, culture and ecology, but it shows a model of becoming a sustainable society, not an island of isolation."

Comparative analysis of the wind characteristics of three landfall typhoons based on stationary and nonstationary wind models,2020,"['Field measurement', 'Landfall typhoons', 'Nonstationary wind characteristics', 'Time-varying mean', 'Time-varying standard deviation']",,"The statistical characteristics of typhoon wind speed records tend to have a considerable time-varying trend; thus, the stationary wind model may not be appropriate to estimate the wind characteristics of typhoon events. Several nonstationary wind speed models have been proposed by pioneers to characterize wind characteristics more accurately, but comparative studies on the applicability of the different wind models are still lacking. In this study, three landfall typhoons, Ampil, Jongdari, and Rumbia, recorded by ultrasonic anemometers atop the Shanghai World Financial Center (SWFC), are used for the comparative analysis of stationary and nonstationary wind characteristics. The time-varying mean is extracted with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method, and the time-varying standard deviation is calculated by the autoregressive moving average generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) model. After extracting the time-varying trend, the longitudinal wind characteristics, e.g., the probability distribution, power spectral density (PSD), turbulence integral scale, turbulence intensity, gust factor, and peak factor, are comparatively analyzed based on the stationary wind speed model, time-varying mean wind speed model and time-varying standard deviation wind speed model. The comparative analysis of the different wind models emphasizes the significance of the nonstationary considerations in typhoon events. The time-varying standard deviation model can better identify the similarities among the different typhoons and appropriately describe the nonstationary wind characteristics of the typhoons."
"Change detection of landscape connectivity arisen by forest transformation in Hazaribagh wildlife sanctuary, Jharkhand (India)",2020,"['Landscape connectivity', 'Biodiversity', 'Forest transformation', 'Wildlife', 'Forest degradation']",,"Forest land conversion is the primary driver of biodiversity decline worldwide. Hazaribagh wildlife sanctuary is a region of rich biodiversity in which forests and wildlife are deteriorating fast. The prime reasons for forest degradation and wildlife loss are the landscape connectivity weakening and forest transformation. In the present work, landscape connectivity and forest transformation relationships were analyzed in a spatio-temporal domain.The forest patches as a group of spectral abundance were extracted using the endmember retrieval technique. The connectivity analysis was performed by using a connectivity index in the extracted forest patches. Forest transformation is calculated using a post-classification change detection strategy for five types of forest cover during the four phases of the year (1992–2005, 2005–2010, 2010–2017 and 1992–2017). The forest cover was measured using a forest canopy density model using spectral indices. The landscape connectivity of 80–100% exhibit a rapid increase of 38% in 2005 from 1992 contrary to a 13% decrease in 2010 and 2017. The 23% loss of forest cover from 2005 to 2010 and a 17% loss in 2010–2017 phase of forest transformation weakened the forest connectivity.Forest cover, having a density higher than 40% was more vulnerable to degradation and landscape connectivity loss.The result shows that such declines of forest cover and landscape connectivity will reduce the genetic diversity in the forest, especially the mammalian population."

In this study, we analyze the SQuAD dataset quantitatively and qualitatively to demonstrate how the MRQA models answer the questions. It turns out that the current MRQA models rely heavily on the use of wh-words and Lexical Answer Types (LAT) in the questions instead of using the meanings of the entire questions and the evidence documents. Based on this analysis, we present the directions for new datasets so that they can facilitate the advancement of current QA techniques centered around the MRQA models."
A Statistical Data-Filtering Method Proposed for Short-Term Load Forecasting Models,2020,['ARIMA · Confi dence level · Data fi ltering · Neural network · Long short-term memory · And short-term load forecasting'],,"Reliability assessment of the SCADA-system based load data is necessary for improving accuracy of short-term load forecasting (STLF) methods in a distribution network (DN). Specifi cally, the reliability evaluation of the load data is to properly eliminate noise/outliers caused by random power consumption behaviors or the sudden change in load demand from industrial and residential customers in the DN. Thus, this paper proposes a novel statistical data-fi ltering method, working at an input data pre-processing stage, which will evaluate the reliability of input load data by analyzing all possible data confi dence levels in order to fi lter-out the noise/outliers for accuracy improvement of diff erent short-term load forecasting models. The proposed statistical data-fi ltering method is also compared to other existing data-fi ltering methods (such as Kalman Filter, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)). Moreover, several case studies of short-term load forecasting for a typical 22 kV distribution network in Vietnam are conducted with an Artifi cial Neural Network (ANN) model, a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) model, a combined model of Long Short-Term Memory Network and Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM-CNN), and a conventional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to validate the statistical data-fi ltering method proposed. The achieved results demonstrate which the STLF using ANN, LSTM-RNN, LSTMCNN, and ARIMA models with the statistical data-fi ltering method can all outperform those with the existing data-fi ltering methods. Additionally, the numerical results also indicate that in case the SCADA-based load data is normally distributed, time-series forecasting models should be more preferred than neural network models; otherwise, when the SCADA-based load data contains multiple normally distributed sub-datasets, neural network-based prediction models are highly recommended."
Nonparametric modeling of self-excited forces based on relations between flutter derivatives,2020,"['aerodynamic stability/instability', 'bridge aerodynamics', 'flutter', 'time-domain methods', 'wind loads']",,"Unsteady self-excited forces are commonly represented by parametric models such as rational functions. However, this requires complex multiparametric nonlinear fitting, which can be a challenging task that requires know-how. This paper explores the alternative nonparametric modeling of unsteady self-excited forces based on relations between flutter derivatives. By exploiting the properties of the transfer function of linear causal systems, we show that damping and stiffness aerodynamic derivatives are related by the Hilbert transform. This property is utilized to develop exact simplified expressions, where it is only necessary to consider the frequency dependency of either the aeroelastic damping or stiffness terms but not both simultaneously. This approach is useful if the experimental data on aerodynamic derivatives that are related to the damping are deemed more accurate than the data that are related to the stiffness or vice versa. The proposed numerical models are evaluated with numerical examples and with data from wind tunnel experiments. The presented method can evaluate any continuous fitted table of interpolation functions of various types, which are independently fitted to aeroelastic damping and stiffness terms. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology performs well. The relations between the flutter derivatives can be used to enhance the understanding of experimental modeling of aerodynamic self-excited forces for bridge decks."
Economic application of structural health monitoring and internet of things in efficiency of building information modeling,2020,"['Building Information Modeling (BIM)', 'SHM', 'IOT', 'sensor', 'network']",,"One of the powerful data management tools is Building Information Modeling (BIM) which operates through obtaining, recalling, sharing, sorting and sorting data and supplying a digital environment of them.

The recording of SHM data is an effective way for engineers, facility managers and owners which make the BIM dynamic through the provision of updated information regarding the occurring state and health of different sections of the building. On the other hand, digital transformation is a continuous challenge in construction. In a cloud-based BIM platform, environmental and localization data are integrated which shape the Internet-of-Things (IoT) method. In order to improve work productivity, living comfort, and entertainment, the IoT has been growingly utilized in several products (such as wearables, smart homes). However, investigations confronting the integration of these two technologies (BIM and IoT) remain inadequate and solely focus upon the automatic transmission of sensor information to BIM models. Therefore, in this composition, the use of BIM based on SHM and IOT is reviewed and the economic application is considered."
A Three-Dimensional Geotechnical Spatial Modeling Method for Borehole Dataset Using Optimization of Geostatistical Approaches,2020,"['Three-dimensional geotechnical modeling', 'Spatial interpolation', 'Geostatistics', 'Standard penetration test', 'Cross validation']",,"A large amount of geotechnical investigation data is essential for the highly reliable design of geotechnical structure at a construction site. The number of geotechnical investigations, however, has been generally insufficient and spatially biased owing to economic and spatial–temporal limitations. In this study, a geotechnical three-dimensional spatial modeling was implemented using an optimized geostatistical interpolation approach at a bridge construction site in the south-central part of the Korean peninsula. The geotechnical investigation data were collected and standardized for the construction of a geo-database. For the site-specific stratification, a kriging-based integration of the geo-layers and the seismic velocity from a seismic refraction survey were applied. The value from a standard penetration test (SPT)-N of an uninvestigated location was predicted using parametric and nonparametric geostatistical methods. We accomplished three-dimensional spatial interpolations using ordinary kriging, a sequential Gaussian simulation with a normal score transformed dataset, and a sequential indicator simulation using the geodatabase. A leave-one-out cross validation was carried out to quantitatively evaluate the reliability of the three-dimensional modeling. Finally, a three-dimensional geotechnical spatial model assigned with subsurface stratification and SPT-Nvalues was constructed using the sequential Gaussian simulation."

The Doppler frequencies of the blade tip were extracted from the produced spectrogram images and relative errors were calculated by comparing with their theoretical values. Experiment results show that the maximum Doppler frequencies and revolution rates extracted from the spectrogram images by the simulation and measurement are matched with the theoretical values very well within the maximum relative errors of 3.5%."

Cancer cells undergoing epigenetic transition show short-term resistance and are transformed into cells with medium-term resistance by drug treatment,2020,[],,"To elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms of drug resistance, epigenetically reprogrammed H460 cancer cells (R-H460) were established by the transient introduction of reprogramming factors. Then, the R-H460 cells were induced to differentiate by the withdrawal of stem cell media for various durations, which resulted in differentiated R-H460 cells (dR-H460). Notably, dR-H460 cells differentiated for 13 days (13dR-H460 cells) formed a significantly greater number of colonies showing drug resistance to both cisplatin and paclitaxel, whereas the dR-H460 cells differentiated for 40 days (40dR-H460 cells) lost drug resistance; this suggests that 13dR-cancer cells present short-term resistance (less than a month). Similarly, increased drug resistance to both cisplatin and paclitaxel was observed in another R-cancer cell model prepared from N87 cells. The resistant phenotype of the cisplatin-resistant (CR) colonies obtained through cisplatin treatment was maintained for 2–3 months after drug treatment, suggesting that drug treatment transforms cells with short-term resistance into cells with medium-term resistance. In single-cell analyses, heterogeneity was not found to increase in 13dR-H460 cells, suggesting that cancer cells with short-term resistance, rather than heterogeneous cells, may confer epigenetically driven drug resistance in our reprogrammed cancer model. The epigenetically driven short-term and medium-term drug resistance mechanisms could provide new cancer-fighting strategies involving the control of cancer cells during epigenetic transition."

The purpose of this study was to examine the concept and flow of contents tourism and to approach practical application models in Korea. To this end, we have examined various aspects of existing contents tourism. It also analyzed research results and related trends on contents tourism in Korea. In this process, we emphasized that we should pay attention to content as an object of contents tourism. Based on these discussions, the components of contents tourism were reorganized by dividing them into contents elements and tourism elements. In addition, based on this, we extracted the relationship structure model between components and looked at the basic properties of contents tourism. In particular, we tried to approach from a multi-faceted perspective by adding elements such as characters, stories, and places, which are attributes as content, to the existing research model approached mainly by the relationship between the subjects of tourism. However, we pointed out that these basic structural models are not suitable for the current situation in Korea. Therefore, the company attempted to transform itself into a Korean model of contents tourism centered on the acceptor. And based on this, we presented several types of Korean contents tourism."

This study used the developed model for seismic analysis using SAP2000 software. For the complex superheaters, reheaters, economizers, and membrane walls of the boiler, which consisted of numerous tubes, a method of modeling them by the equivalent elements in the viewpoint of stiffness and/or inertia was proposed. In addition, a method of modeling for the connection between the boiler and steel structure was proposed. Many hangers that connect the boiler to the girders of a steel structure were transformed into equivalent hangers by decreasing the number. The displacements of the boiler stoppers on the buckstay and the posts of the steel structure were coupled by considering their interface condition. Static analysis under the self-loading condition for the developed integrated model was implemented, and the results of deformation indicated that the behavior of the steel members and the major components of the boiler were appropriate. In conclusion, the integrated model developed in this study can be used to evaluate the safety of the boiler and steel structure under seismic loads."

Failure to account for these uncertainties in the controller design may lead to performance degradation in real-world applications. As a result, SMPC (Stochastic Model Predictive Control), which provides a probabilistic framework for the nonlinear model predictive control of systems with stochastic uncertainty, has attracted much attention. The main challenge of SMPC is the efficient propagation of probabilistic uncertainty through system dynamics. In this paper, unscented transformation was used to efficiently estimate the distribution of states under uncertainties, and it is applied to trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance of an unmanned underwater vehicle. The performance of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated through numerical simulations."
Hilbert transform based approach to improve extraction of “drive-by” bridge frequency,2020,"['Hilbert Transform', 'bridge frequency', 'drive-by bridge inspection', 'bridge health monitoring', 'non-destructive evaluation']",,"Recently, the concept of""drive-by"" bridge monitoring system using indirect measurements from a passing vehicle to extract key parameters of a bridge has been rapidly developed. As one of the most key parameters of a bridge, the natural frequency has been successfully extracted theoretically and in practice using indirect measurements. The frequency of bridge is generally calculated applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) directly. However, it has been demonstrated that with the increase in vehicle velocity, the estimated frequency resolution of FFT will be very low causing a great extracted error. Moreover, because of the low frequency resolution, it is hard to detect the frequency drop caused by any damages or degradation of the bridge structural integrity. This paper will introduce a new technique of bridge frequency extraction based on Hilbert Transform (HT) that is not restricted to frequency resolution and can, therefore, improve identification accuracy. In this paper, deriving from the vehicle response, the closed-form solution associated with bridge frequency removing the effect of vehicle velocity is discussed in the analy tical study. Then a numerical Vehicle-Bridge Interaction (VBI) model with a quarter car model is adopted to demonstrate the proposedapproach. Finally, factors that affect the proposed approach are studied, including vehicle velocity, signal noise, and road roughness profile."

It always produces complete division of the image as the specific demand. However, it is prone to over-segmentation which makes the result unfavorable. Therefore, this paper proposes modified watershed algorithm based on Gaussian mixture model(GMM) to reduce the over-segmentation. Distance transformed image is processed by GMM. And expectation maximization(EM) algorithm is used to fit GMM to data. Average of these means is chosen as optimal threshold and the image is converted into binary image based on the obtained threshold value. Binary image thus obtained is eroded with the help of proper structuring element. Watershed segmentation thus carried out on the eroded image gives the effective segmentation results. Different kernels such as corn, rice, and wheat are effectively segmented when the proposed methodology is used. 38 corn kernels, 95 rice kernels, and 32 wheat kernels are used for the experimental purpose. The accuracy of segmentation is as high as 94.7%, 96.8%, and 90.6% for corn, rice, and wheat respectively."

However, the majority of speech recognition systems on the market are developed on data with limited diversity of speakers and tend to perform well on typical adult speakers only.

The leaves of the plant have been traditionally used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in Malaysia. The conventional quality control analysis of medicinal plants that relies on the quantification of few major metabolites is considered time-consuming since it requires extensive sample preparation and neglects the possible impacts that the minor metabolites could have on the activity. This study was aimed to investigate the α-glucosidase inhibitory (AGI) potential of different hydromethanolic extracts of T. scandens leaves and to establish a predictive multivariate model that could be used for the quality evaluation of T. scandens leaf based on the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of its extracts. Different solvent ratios (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% methanol in water) were used to prepare a total of 36 extracts. The AGI potential and the FT-IR fingerprint spectrum were acquired for each extract. A four components orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) model (1 + 3 + 0) with R2Y of 0.951 and Q2Y of 0.916 was established to describe the correlation between the fingerprint FT-IR spectra of different T. scandens extracts and their corresponding AGI activities. The carbon-halide, carbon–oxygen single bonds, as well as the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were identified to be positively correlated with the AGI activity. To sum up, an OPLS model was successfully developed as a rapid quality evaluation method to predict the AGI activity of T. scandens."

The structure relationship is described by multi-body system theory, and the geometric error model is deduced by homogeneous coordinate transformation method. The aim was to improve the overall accuracy, reduce the cost, trace the error source, and get the corresponding relationship between the basic geometric errors and the precision parameters of the related parts. Under the requirement of ensuring the overall accuracy, an optimization function was established that minimizes the cost and relaxes all accuracy parameters to the greatest extent. Finally, MATLAB and its genetic algorithm toolbox was used for analysis. Verification shows that this model can properly reduce the cost on the premise of ensuring the accuracy."

To this end, we examined the decision theory that reasonably explained the policy-making process through literature studies such as previous studies and papers related to outsourcing policy. By conducting in-depth interviews with broadcasting-related incumbent companies, outsourcing policy evaluation and problems, and policy alternatives that can supplement the outsourcing policy were examined.  As a result of in-depth interviews with broadcasting-related workers, analysis of the failure of the factor market due to the rapid rise in appearance fees and author fees due to the problem of outsourcing policy at the present stage, decrease in production capacity of broadcasting companies, intensification of genre concentration, and inequality relationship between broadcasting companies and outsourcing producers. done. In order to supplement the outsourcing policy, the ratio of self-production of Bingsongsa dramas is needed, coping with the spread of outsourcing in the entertainment sector, easing adjustment of the regulations for broadcasters sponsorship notices, substantial financial support for independent producers and broadcasters, and the upper limit for author fees and appearances in the drama sector. Implementation, etc. were presented. If the contraction of the ongoing drama slots leads to the sale of the program band, the transition to a new system in which broadcasters only organize and outsourcers are in charge of production may appear."
Linear prediction and z-transform based CDF-mapping simulation algorithm of multivariate non-Gaussian fluctuating wind pressure,2020,"['Non-Gaussian wind pressure', 'LPZ spectral analysis', 'CDF-mapping', 'Multivariate simulation']",,"Methods for stochastic simulation of non-Gaussian wind pressure have increasingly addressed the efficiency and accuracy contents to offer an accurate description of the extreme value estimation of the long-span and high-rise structures. This paper presents a linear prediction and z-transform (LPZ) based Cumulative distribution function (CDF) mapping algorithm for the simulation of multivariate non-Gaussian fluctuating wind pressure. The new algorithm generates realizations of non-Gaussian with prescribed marginal probability distribution function (PDF) and prescribed spectral density function (PSD). The inverse linear prediction and z-transform function (ILPZ) is deduced. LPZ is improved and applied to non-Gaussian wind pressure simulation for the first time. The new algorithm is demonstrated to be efficient, flexible, and more accurate in comparison with the FFT-based method and Hermite polynomial model method in two examples for transverse softening and longitudinal hardening non-Gaussian wind pressures."
Review on the Usage of Deep Learning Models in Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis,2020,"['Sentiment analysis', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Opinion mining']",,"In recent years, Sentiment Analysis is reshaping the business operations of many organizations by monitoring their brand reputation on social media and acquiring insights from customer""s feedback. Sentiment Analysis is one of the classification tools that identifies and extracts the subjective information of a product. This subjective information can be stated in different ways, such as feedback, discussions, blogs, podcasts, and video logs. This type of information generated by the empowered customers is known as user-generated content, which is traditionally in the form of words. The analysis was performed on a huge number of words using Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is a Unimodal Sentiment Analysis. With the rapid growth in the usage of the Internet, social media turned out to be a platform to share the thoughts of the individuals. This caused researchers to migrate from the traditional Unimodal analysis to Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, which includes video, audio, and images. This approach leverages the use of emotion and content and helps identify the scope and polarity of an individual’s sentiment. With the latest deep learning algorithms, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis can solve the problem of sarcasm identification. Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis generates more accurate results compared to Uni Modal Sentiment Analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to define Sentiment Analysis and review the approaches and techniques in Sentiment Analysis from conventional Unimodal to Multimodal. In addition, this paper discusses a Multimodal Sentiment Analysis architecture using a transformers attention net."

Hypotheses rely on variables such as: counts of inventors, applicants, technology classes, countries selected for international patenting and geographical origins of patent citations. The research uses quantitative techniques (descriptive statistics, ANOVA, Jaccard index and social network metrics). Using multiple analytical perspectives, the study demonstrates the specificity of Chinese patents and their limited comparability with documents from other patent offices. This has important implications for the development of economic models, which need to take into account the identified incommensurability in cross-country patent data and avoid direct comparisons of data from China and other patent systems owing to the unique features and functions of patents in China."

In order to determine the inclusion of a constant term, a T-test on the mean was performed. The pre-whitening process was performed on the producer price index, which was an input time series, to estimate the pre-whitening parameter of the KOSDAQ index, and the transition function model was determined by estimating the cross-correlation function and impact response weight between the producer price index and the KOSDAQ index. The autocorrelation analysis of the transition function model was performed to estimate the noise time series model, and the KOSDAQ index prediction model was presented by combining the transition function model with the noise model.

Accordingly, in Chapter 2, the characteristics and limitations of the Karl Popper-type discussion model were first reviewed, and then the problems of the current Sookmyung debate’s model were reviewed. The Sookmyung debate’s model has a weakness that cannot be realized through active debate through argument and poorness in which arguments and evidence are not abundant due to a short four-minute disposition. In addition, structural problems in favor of the favor team can lead to scalability in debate and fairness in judging.In Chapter 3, we looked at the point of supplementing the Sookmyung debate’s model as a way to revitalize the discussion contest while making the most of the characteristics of the unique Sookmyung debate’s model that combines the Karl Popper type discussion model and free debate. In addition, based on this, a new Sookmyung discussion model was sought through comparison with the CEDA method. In order to supplement the biased structure that favors the favor team, the favor team is in the introductory phase and the opposing team is preempted in the opposition phase. In order to complement the poorness of the argument, two arguments were placed to induce the scalability of the in-depth discussion through sufficient arguments. In addition, it has been reorganized to enhance discussion and increase persuasiveness by separating the stages of objection and final speech.In order for these proposals to be effective, it is necessary to go through the stage of verification that is actually applied.

The problem of determining a global solution for parameters and multicollinearity problems are identified and modified by examining the results of previous studies on data. The least squares method requires attention because a local solution can be found rather than a global solution if considering a specific constraint or a limited candidate group. The method of exploring this multicollinearity problem can be confirmed by a statistic known as a variance inflation factor. Therefore, the Lanchester model is simplified to avoid these problems, and the combat power attrition rate model was proposed which is statistically significant and easy to explain. When fitting the model, the dependence problem between the data has occurred due to autocorrelation. Matters that might be underestimated or overestimated were resolved by the Cochrane-Orcutt method as well as guaranteeing independence and normality."

In the evaluation model, we divided the main evaluation areas into the quality of digital content itself and the user’ s perception. And the construct concepts of quality were set as information quality, service quality, ease of use quality, and enjoyment quality, and measurement items for factors representing each construct concept were determined. Next, we evaluated the validity of the museum digital content quality evaluation model using the structural equation based on the data acquired through the survey. First, composite reliability and AVE(average variance extraction) were reviewed to verify convergent validity. and then the discriminant validity was verified. As a result, it was confirmed that the evaluation quality is appropriate to be composed of four sub-quality and that each measuring indicator is valid for measuring sub-quality. The significance of this study are as follows. First, the model we presented will serve as a fundamental model for evaluating the quality of museum digital contents. In other words, the evaluation factors and measurement indicators of this model can be used as reference models for the creation of the quality evaluation table (store card) of the content to be evaluated.

The proposed converter uses multiple transformers that can expand output ports easily. Therefore, transformers and the proposed multi-port DAB converter can be designed simply. In addition, the number of coupling inductors can be reduced in the proposed three-port DAB converter compared with that in conventional multiport DAB converters. The power decoupling characteristics and equivalent circuit of the proposed converter are analyzed using theoretical model approaches.

The purpose of this paper is to present common-item scale-linking methods for the multidimensional NR model and investigate their characteristics and performances. For this, the least squares (LSQ) method and the item-category response function (IRF) method were presented and their functions were examined through computer simulations. The simulation study included three factors of (a) type of population ability distribution, (b) sample size, and (c) number of anchor items. Simulation results showed that overall, the LSQ method was inferior to the IRF method in estimating the linking coefficients (rotation matrix and translation vector) used to transform an arbitrary multidimensional ability scale to the base scale. In particular, the LSQ method tended to considerably under-estimate or over-estimate the variances of ability variables when recovering the underlying ability distribution through scale linking. On the other hand, the IRF method recovered well the parameters of the underlying ability distribution as well as the item parameters through scale linking. At the end of the paper, a discussion is provided as to how the IRF linking method should be implemented in association with the process of test data analysis based on the multidimensional NR model."

Although this model considers nonlinearities among variables by using log transformation for the dependent variable, it reveals limitations in improving estimation accuracy because of its inherent characteristics of linearity assumption between independent and dependent variables. In this study, we proposed an artificial neural network (ANN) based model to predict the amount of damages due to natural disasters more accurately, which does not require the linearity assumption among the variables. For verification of the proposed model, we compared the model estimates with those from the regression model, including the Natural Disaster Risk Index (NDRI), Regional Safety Grades (RSG), and actual damage amounts.

This model is a practical model based on the analysis of the challenges and status of church education in globalization, and the reconstruction of the global citizenship as a multi-citizens beyond the sense of home-church-local community. The essence of church education is for each individual to restore the image of God and to cultivate a mature Christian who resembles Jesus Christ. Today, however, the Korean church is calling for the acquisition of mature global citizenship suitable for the era of globalization as the chaos of Christian identity intensifies in tandem with the rapidly changing globalization. From this point of view, the model of Christian education to build a human image suitable for the era of globalization is as follows. First of all, the purpose of Christian education is to conduct a postconventional global citizen-becoming centered on co-living, and the goal of education is 1) to become a global citizen with a global reflective-self, 2) to become a global citizen with a global open-self, and 3) to become a global citizen with a global solidarity-self. Education methods and content can present 1) a global competency-building education model, 2) a anti-biased education model, 3) a lifelong education model that aims for co-living. Professors-learners should consider the curriculum that avoids the subject of education or the fixed absolute truth, acknowledges differences and cares. And in a mutually beneficial environment through hospitality, the transformative maturity of‘becoming’can provide an educational environment in which a sustainable evaluation takes place rather than‘can be’focus. This model has important implications in that it recognizes the crisis situation of Korean church education in the era of globalization and has prepared a new paradigm shift in Christian education, which aims to become a postconventional global citizen centered on co-living."

For this purpose, we developed the Ensemble Forecast Sensitivity to observation (EFSO) monitoring system based on Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) system coupled with Korean Integrated Model (KIM). We calculated 24 h error variance of each of observations and then classified as beneficial or detrimental effects. In details, the relative rankings were according to their magnitude and analyzed the forecast sensitivity by region for north, south hemisphere and tropics. We performed cycle experiment in order to confirm the EFSO result whether reliable or not. According to the evaluation of the EFSO monitoring, GPSRO was classified as detrimental observation during the specified period and reanalyzed by data-denial experiment.Data-denial experiment means that we detect detrimental observation using the EFSO and then repeat the analysis and forecast without using the detrimental observations. The accuracy of forecast in the denial of detrimental GPSRO observation is better than that in the default experiment using all of the GPSRO observation. It means that forecast skill score can be improved by not assimilating observation classified as detrimental one by the EFSO monitoring system."

Курчаткина «Минус 273 градуса по Цельсию»,2020,"['Dystopia', 'Model of the world', 'Metaphor', 'Absurdity', 'Totalitarianism', 'Freedom', 'Антиутопия', 'Модель мира', 'Метафора', 'Абсурд', 'Тоталитаризм', 'Свобода']",,"The article presents an attempt to examine the novel Minus 273 Degrees Celsius by Anatoly Kurchatkin. The novel belongs to the genre of dystopian fiction, thus a number of features characteristic of the dystopian archplot can be found in the novel. The writer quite clearly states his principle: the another world image is significant for him as a metaphor of reality in the first place. The article focuses on the dystopian model of the world depicted in the novel. While presenting the social environment and the relationships between the authorities and the citizens, the writer follows the traditions established by his predecessors which expose the system’s urge for the people’s slavish devotion incited by fear and admiration. In contrast to some dystopias, in which personal environment is considered as the only value and can guarantee a person’s inner freedom, the writer withdraws such salvatory function from the personal inner space so it has to adapt to the environment imposed by the outer world. The main character, as opposed to other characters of some popular well-known dystopias, does take a back seat, he is driven by circumstances, and his joining to a group of rioters at the end of the novel cannot be considered as his deliberate search for struggle. The article mainly analyses the writer’s position at the end of the novel. Opposite to the opinion of some critics, the writer does not give his main character a chance to find salvation and to break the deadlock. In an attempt to break through that sterile system the main hero joins the resistance movement, but apparently he gets out of one moral prison in order to get into another one. The question of finding freedom remains open in the novel, and the answer to it cannot be found in the domain of fighting of the outer forces but in the transformation of a person’s conscience."

After processing the coordinate system transformation between camera and image, the distortion calibration and image alignment process of input image were calculated, and the rigid transformation and feature points for defect classification were extracted. Based on the extracted feature points, the adaptive defect pattern of injection molding parts is classified, and then the detection process is carried out from them. From some experiments on defect detectng with the injection molding parts images, it is analyzed that the proposed algorithm is capable of defect detection with high accuracy of less than 1mm in real-time on our own acquired data. From these good experimental results a possibility of implementing an defect detection using the proposed scheme is finally suggested."

As such, the huge crisis of the pendemic is sweeping to the midst of high waves into a strange new normal society where new rules that have not previously experienced our society with the change of the 4th Industrial Revolution appear as new common sense.This study started with an awareness of the necessity of reinforcing Christian civic education to fulfill the public responsibilities of Christians by recognizing the social and situational problems of this era as a public task amid in the crisis and change of the pendemic. Therefore, a meaningful work was undertaken to find an educational ministry practice frame for essential core competencies and transformative transformation competencies responding to changes in the times as education to cultivate and reinforce competencies as Christian citizens.First, the theoretical basis for competency education for Christian citizens was reviewed through the theological and Christian education theories that were studied in the situation of public theology about the public perception and social responsibility of Christians on the issues of the times. Furthermore, through this study, education to establish and cultivate the public identity of disciples-citizens as a core competency is explored in a multifaceted method of educational ministry, and educational methods were searched for cultivating communication competencies of Christian citizens with practical capacity of public faith.In conclusion, through this study, an educational ministry frame of identity cultivation, the core competency of recognizing the position of the public mission as a Christian citizen while living as a disciple of God's kingdom in the world and an educational frame to cultivate the ability to communicate as a transformative Christian citizen's transformative competency to carry out public tasks was systematically established, and an educational ministry convergence frame was proposed for cultivating core competencies and transformation competencies for Christian citizenship education."

AHP is a method for transforming complex decision problems into a hierarchal structure, which is composed of elements in the upper and lower levels and then using pairwise comparisons to evaluate these elements and subsequently to obtain their relative weights.The elements' relative importance is reliable if the elements in the lower hierarchical levels (sub factors) that comprise each element in the upper hierarchical level (primary factor) are equal in number. In other words, if the number of sub factors is different for each primary factor, a serious error is expected as a result.Therefore, this study proposes a modification of AHP that can avoid such an error when AHP is used.Specifically, an error that arises from different number of sub factors (matrix size) can be overcome by making the number of sub factors identical for each primary factor. The resulting model has been validated through the applications in different AHP hierarchical structures."

Possible world can be defined as the constructed multiple narrative models which define the normality and the abnormality. The judicial records describe actual incidents, however, the description implies the interpretation of events so that they are also the constructed model in the narrative world same as the tales.In Korean classical Judicial Reports, there are many cases of violent crime. Females are generally the victim of these crime, however sometimes they are classified as the offender. Thus, this essay analyzes how the female figuration is constructed in these reports. The judicial records write about the value of right and wrong, in this process, the minority females might be unilaterally judged by the conventional common law and system without considerations. The female voices are excluded in the formal records, on the other hand, the tales can construct an alternative world as against the formal records.From the previous analysis, the types of narratives are classified female figurations the groups as the victim, as the offender, and as the problem-solving subject which found only in the tales-narratives not in the records-narratives. Based on these three types of classification, the narratives with similar motifs are detected and analyzed together in the perspective of possible world. Several voices in Heumheumsinseo construct their own independent possible world in official area, and as do the voices in various version of tales. When these two levels of narratives are compared, the transformation of possible multiple worlds by the different desires and the obligation will be investigated. The Rule of Law in Heumheumsinseo tended to be and tried to be equal and in progress, however, it does not signify the minority female deserves to be equal.Tales could construct the alternative world compared with the formal records, nonetheless, it does not demonstrate the revolutionary model which fully reflected the desire of females. Accordingly, the manifestation of hidden voices in tales is probably not the completed solution and it means that the development of the system does not always accomplish with the minority female. However, it is necessary to consider the invisible elements in narratives for extending the signification of classic narratives."

However, existing 2D algorithms, even when utilizing advanced non-rigid deformation algorithms, cannot handle large spatial transformations for complex target human poses. In this study, we propose a 3D clothing reconstruction method using a 3D human body model. The resulting 3D models of try-on clothes can be more easily deformed when applied to rest posed standard human models. Then, the poses and shapes of 3D clothing models can be transferred to the target human models estimated from 2D images. Finally, the deformed clothing models can be rendered and blended with target human representations. Experimental results with the VITON dataset used in the previous works show that the shapes of reconstructed clothing are significantly more natural, compared to the 2D image-based deformation results when human poses and shapes are estimated accurately."

Recently, another progress has been taking place from recurrent neural network(RNN)-based NMT to transformer-based NMT (T-NMT). As the performance of NMT has evolved, a lot of research papers for machine translation have been published in the field of interpretation and translation. Their main focus is on whether machine translation can replace human translation, and analyzing the quality of translation results. In this paper, we briefly explain the history of the machine translation research and review the mechanism of NMT. NMT is basically composed of three parts: encoder, attention mechanism, and decoder. Further we discuss the new transformer structure based on the encoder-decoder model. We also discuss the challenges in NMT and explain the research direction or solutions to the problems. Particular attention is given to the mistranslation of NMT, quality of the translation, and robustness against the noises in the training dataset as well as in the testing sentences. In order to test the performance of transformer-based NMT, we used the Google NMT (GNMT) service for 4 languages – Korean, English, German, and Japanese.

Especially, this study focuses on experiences of South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan which were considered as core countries adopting the developmental state model actively and achieving economic development successfully. Major research findings are as follows. First, since globalization, the transformative path of the post-developmental state in East Asia has differed from country to country. While South Korea and Japan have tried to dismantle the developmental state model and turned into neoliberal model, Taiwan has maintained the developmental state model basically despite of some decline and modification. Second, even though some national variations, convergence tendency into neoliberalism was founded obviously in the East Asian development models. Third, nevertheless, because institutional inertia of old developmental state remained and affected more or less to development model, the post-developmental states in East Asia have revealed hybrid forms and distinctive features. For example, Korea's model since the post-developmental state would be characterized as the 'developmental neoliberalism.' Fourth, developmental and interventionist policies under Korea and Japan's neoliberalism and Taiwan's developmental state have almost failed to achieve the desired results and positive performances. Fifth, as the East Asian countries shifted into neoliberal economy, all of them have suffered from increasing income inequality and social polarization."

Pre-training the transformer-based language models would be computationally expensive since they are consist of deep and broad architecture and layers using an attention mechanism and also require huge amount of data to train. Hence, it became mandatory to do fine-tuning large pre-trained language models which are trained by Google or some companies can afford the resources and cost. There are various techniques for fine tuning the language models and this paper examines three techniques, which are data augmentation, tuning the hyper paramters and partly re-constructing the neural networks. For data augmentation, we use no-answer augmentation and back-translation method. Also, some useful combinations of hyper parameters are observed by conducting a number of experiments. Finally, we have GRU, LSTM networks to boost our model performance with adding those networks to BERT pre-trained model. We do fine-tuning the pre-trained korean-based language model through the methods mentioned above and push the F1 score from baseline up to 89.66. Moreover, some failure attempts give us important lessons and tell us the further direction in a good way."

Modeling is a fundamental and essential element in computer graphics. Parametric modeling proceeds with modeling by adjusting the parameter values of formulas that define geometry figures and object relationships based on traditional modeling methods. Parametric modeling methods require systematic research to use methods that are applied and accessed in a rather complex and diverse manner. Since parametric modeling is based on traditional methods in this study, we have studied traditional modelling methods in Chapter 2 and various methods of parametric modelling in Chapter 3. The traditional methods of modeling were divided into polygon, NURBS, and subdivisions, respectively, to learn about the characteristics of modeling. In Chapter 3, parametric modeling was divided into examples using one and various parametric modeling tools. Of the parametric modelling methods, we found that tools such as Bend, Bulge, Shear, Taper, Twist, FFD, Melt, Cloner and Voronoi Fracture used the method of applying variations to traditional modelling methods. In addition to the transformation, cloning uses a variety of applications by replicating existing modeling. The parametric modeling method of crack was known to represent objects in a way that causes cracks in the modeling, which is destroyed and fused. In addition, a variety of parametric modelling can be used to capture the characteristics of each of the various parametric methods and to implement the unique morphological characteristics of the complex mixed parametric modelling."

The main results are as follows: First, the recognition level, technology acceptability, and readiness for digital transformation of micro enterprises were generally insufficient. Second, the effects of technology acceptance for digital transformation on digital transformation willingness and digital transformation readiness on the digital transformation implementation were statistically significant, while the effect of digital transformation recognition on digital transformation willingness was relatively small. Third, the larger the sales volume of micro enterprises, the higher the degree of digital transformation readiness and digital transformation technology acceptance. These results imply that for the digital transformation of micro enterprises, it is important to improve the readiness level such as infrastructure, human resources, knowledge, etc., and increase the acceptability level of technology understanding and technology learning, and pay attention to the sales level of micro enterprises. Increasing awareness of digital transformation alone cannot promote digital transformation, and as the company scales up, the need for digital transformation increases, suggesting that special attention should be paid to digital transformation of micro enterprises with large sales volume."

In a white paper titled “Digital Enterprise,” published jointly by the World Economic Forum and Accenture in 2016, four key factors and two to three details for each key factor needed for analog companies to transform themselves into digital ones were presented. As a result of the overall analysis of the private sector and the government, “business model” was rated as the most important key factor, “performance support” as the least important factor, and “discovery, development and implementation of new digital business models” as the most important detail, while “expanding the proportion of investment in the security sector” was considered the least important. Meanwhile, as a result of analyzing the private sector and the government separately, both the private sector and the government rated the “business model” the most as a key factor, but considering the details, the private sector rated the “discovery, development and implementation of new digital business models” the highest, while the government gave the highest priority to “launch new projects linked to existing projects.” This study confirmed that the perception of private and government priorities in preparing for digital transformation is different. In the future, there needs to be an open and free forum for the private and government to share each others perceptions in a more cooperative and flexible manner."

We find that their image is set in a certain style by the media. Various efforts have been made to improve this type of social perception, especially after the introduction of mass media. Some of those attempts, however, did not work very well because they unintendedly relied on distorted images of these people, such as being melodramatic, or being a super-hero with savant syndrome, which is not as common as we are led to believe. In the worst case, they are often forced to have desires in a way that society wants. Meanwhile, several studies have attempted to categorize disability models according to how the media perceives the disabled and analyze video contents in this framework. Researchers have attempted to track down how content in this area is produced through four models: the medical-limitation model, the medical-diversity model, the social-limitation model and the social-diversity model according to certain media characteristics, such as whether the content appeared in films, on TV and/or in internet videos. There studies enable us to discover the nature of each form of media and the limitations of each as well. Some studies successfully proposed desirable models for society. Here, we analyze the narrative structure of a documentary film, Rising Phoenix, produced by Ian Bonhote and Peter Ettedgui in 2020 and by doing so examine how the aforementioned four frames work within a film. We focus on how a certain frame transforms into another in the narrative structure, following previous studies in which only one framework was found to exist in each set of contents. This approach can allow us to examine how disability models and media frames can work for narrative purposes and provide directions for more advanced and desirable disability acceptance by the media."

Such transformation of the society demands a variety of government interventions and policies, especially for the elderly people. Accordingly, social welfare facilities for the elderly become more and more important. However, it would be true that many employees in the social welfare facilities are struggling with negative job attitudes including high levels of job stress, emotional instability, customer management, burnout and others.  Particularly in the social welfare area, the burnout of employees can play a critical role to understand their turnover intention. Thus, this study attempts not only to examine the impacts of job demands and job resources on turnover intention of employees in the social welfare facilities for the elderly, but also to investigate the effects of burnout as a mediator between the relationships.   With the theoretical background built on Job Demand and Job Resource model, this study sets research hypotheses. On the one hand, based on Job Demand model, this study assumes that role conflicts, role overload and negative customer relationship are independent variables that negatively affect burnout. On the other hand, self-efficacy, job autonomy, and social support are set as independent variables that have positive effects on burnout based on Job Resource model.  Data were collected by the self-administered survey from 652 employees who work for social welfare facilities for the elderly. After screening, 618 survey were used for data analyses. For the hypotheses tests, this study conducts structural equation modeling (SEM). The goodness of fits of the research model shows that the model fits the data well (GFI = 0.921, CFI = 0.956, RMSEA = 0.042).  The SEM results find that role overload and negative customer relationship in the Job Demand model have negative effects while self-efficacy and social support have positive effects on burnout. Concerning the relationship between burnout and turnover intention, the analytical result shows that burnout has a positive impact on turnover intention. With regard to the mediating effects, SEM analysis finds that the effects of role overload in the Job Demand model and self-efficacy and social support in the Job Resource model on turnover intention of employees of social welfare facilities for the aged are mediated by burnout.  Based on the statistical analyses, this study argues that social welfare facilities for the elderly should consider ways to reduce role overload and negative customer relationship that the employees perceive from their works, which can decrease burnout. Also, it is necessary that the management should understand how important self-efficacy and social support can be for the decline of burnout. Lastly, for the mediating effect, this study through SEM finds that the impacts of role overload, self-efficacy, and social support on turnover intention of the employees can be mediated by burnout."

Product reviews used in the process of purchasing goods are based on user experience, allowing consumers to engage as producers of information as well as refer to information. This can be a way to increase the efficiency of purchasing decisions from the perspective of consumers, and from the sellers point of view, it can help develop products and strengthen their competitiveness. However, it takes a lot of time and effort to understand the overall assessment and assessment dimensions of the products that I think are important in reading the vast amount of product reviews offered by E-Commerce for the products consumers want to compare. This is because product reviews are unstructured information and it is difficult to read sentiment of reviews and assessment dimension immediately. For example, consumers who want to purchase a laptop would like to check the assessment of comparative products at each dimension, such as performance, weight, delivery, speed, and design.  Therefore, in this paper, we would like to propose a method to automatically generate multi-dimensional product assessment scores in product reviews that we would like to compare. The methods presented in this study consist largely of two phases. One is the pre-preparation phase and the second is the individual product scoring phase. In the pre-preparation phase, a dimensioned classification model and a sentiment analysis model are created based on a review of the large category product group review. By combining word embedding and association analysis, the dimensioned classification model complements the limitation that word embedding methods for finding relevance between dimensions and words in existing studies see only the distance of words in sentences. Sentiment analysis models generate CNN models by organizing learning data tagged with positives and negatives on a phrase unit for accurate polarity detection. Through this, the individual product scoring phase applies the models pre-prepared for the phrase unit review. Multi-dimensional assessment scores can be obtained by aggregating them by assessment dimension according to the proportion of reviews organized like this, which are grouped among those that are judged to describe a specific dimension for each phrase.  In the experiment of this paper, approximately 260,000 reviews of the large category product group are collected to form a dimensioned classification model and a sentiment analysis model. In addition, reviews of the laptops of S and L companies selling at E-Commerce are collected and used as experimental data, respectively. The dimensioned classification model classified individual product reviews broken down into phrases into six assessment dimensions and combined the existing word embedding method with an association analysis indicating frequency between words and dimensions. As a result of combining word embedding and association analysis, the accuracy of the model increased by 13.7%. The sentiment analysis models could be seen to closely analyze the assessment when they were taught in a phrase unit rather than in sentences. As a result, it was confirmed that the accuracy was 29.4% higher than the sentence-based model. Through this study, both sellers and consumers can expect efficient decision making in purchasing and product development, given that they can make multi-dimensional comparisons of products. In addition, text reviews, which are unstructured data, were transformed into objective values such as frequency and morpheme, and they were analysed together using word embedding and association analysis to improve the objectivity aspects of more precise multi-dimensional analysis and research. This will be an attractive analysis model in terms of not only enabling more effective service deployment during the evolving E-Commerce market and fierce competitio"

The basis of demonstration is two aggregate equality theses, that is, ‘total prices total values’ and ‘total profits total surplus values’.Simultaneous dual-system interpretation(SDSI) asserts on the grounds of the simultaneous dual-system model that Marx’s theories of the labour-value and surplus value are inconsistent logically because the total profits are not equal to the total surplus values. This paper applies Marx’s approach to the transformation problem to the simultaneous dual-system model. The results are the followings. Firstly, SDSI’s criticism to Marx are false. Secondly, two aggregate equality theses are validated. As a result this paper underpins the logical consistency of Marx’s theories of the labour-value and surplus value."

Based on related theory and literature review, 3 hypotheses were developed and tested using 143 dyad samples of field employees and their leaders drawn from a large manufacturing company. The regression analysis and the linear structural equation analysis were employed to test the hypotheses and the research model. Results revealed that leader group prototypicality partially mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and leader acceptance, and that the relationship between leader group prototypicality and employees’ innovative behavior was fully mediated by leader acceptance. The results also showed that transformational leadership is indirectly related to employees’ innovative behavior through the mediating influence of leader group prototypicality and, in turn, leader acceptance. This study showed that the relationship between transformational leadership and employees’ innovative behavior could be explained effectively from social identity theory."

Although the cause of fire accidents have not been identified precisely, it should be considered battery and PCS (power conditioning system) as well as unbalance issues in the distribution system. In particular, circulating currents in a neutral line of a grid-connected transformer, which can affect a magnetized current, may have a negative effect on the ESS with unintentional core saturation and surge voltages at the secondary side of the transformer. Therefore, this paper proposes the modeling of the distribution system, which was composed of a substation, grid-connected transformer, and customer loads using PSCAD/EMTDC S/W, to analyze the phenomena of circulating current and surge voltages of the transformer with unbalanced currents in the distribution system. This paper presents a countermeasure for a circulating current with the installation of NGR (neutral grounding resistor) in grid-connected transformer. From the simulation results, it is clear that exceeding the circulating current and surge voltage at the secondary side of the transformer can be one of the causes of fire accidents."
Wave Data Assimilation to Modify Wind Forcing Using an Ensemble Kalman Filter,2020,"['winter storm waves', 'wave modeling', 'data assimilation', 'wind forcing', 'East Sea']",,"In order to improve the predictability of winter storm waves in the East Sea, this article explores the use of the ensemble Kalman filter technique for data assimilation in wave modeling. The nested wave model has been established using SWAN along the east coast of Korea to simulate wave transformation and wave dissipation in coastal areas to obtain a better modeling performance with regard to wind waves and swells in the East Sea. The regional atmospheric model is used to provide high-resolution forcing winds. These are adjusted by directly assimilating measurements of offshore wave heights into the wave model state. The model setup, data assimilation parameters, and validation of prediction are described with optimal conditions during the stormy periods in 2015. The ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation has shown itself to be very efficient, leading to large reductions of up to 40% in the rootmean- square error of the signification wave height compared to the results with and without data assimilation at locations other than those of the observations used. It shows that the wave modeling with ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation is very feasible to predict coastal waves, in particular storm events in the East Sea."

The search for effective teaching technologies has always accompanied pedagogical science in order to find out the best and optimal for a given period of social development way for transferring knowledge. This paper focuses on the problem of teaching Russian dialogic speech outside of the Russian language environment. The authors put forward an idea of teaching oral speech on the basis of an intentional approach and provide its philosophical and psycholinguistic substantiation. This approach considers the schematization of the speech process as a possible method for selecting speech models. The intention is taken as the basis for the schematization of the speech process. The speech formula considered a communicative implementation of the speech process. Analysis of the theoretical literature led authors to the idea of modeling the speech process, which involves learning ready-made forms of communication. In accordance with this idea, the principles of organizing a communicative workshop, as well as a model for teaching oral dialogical speech, were formulated. The practical model of teaching oral speech is based on speech formulas expressing the intentions of formulating a question, clarifying, doubting the authenticity of a statement, providing information, consent and disagreement with the interlocutor. This model was implemented as a part of the integrative course “History of Russian Art” conducted at Tokyo State University of Foreign Studies and confirmed its effectiveness."

Netflix provides high-quality video contents such as movies, dramas, and documentaries to about 200 million monthly subscribers worldwide through a digital-based interface. From the beginning of the OTT service business, Netflix created a direct network effect by providing a digital content curation service that increases in precision as the total number of subscribers increases based on internal big data analysis capabilities. In addition, Netflix was able to settle the OTT service in the market early by licensing a large amount of high-quality contents from external content producers and reselling it to subscribers. Netflix subsequently faced a fundamental crisis in business operations while facing excessive demand for royalty increases by external content producers, but strategically implemented backward integration to transform the business model into an OTT service provider and content producer. Based on the results of internal big data analysis, Netflix succeeded in commercial success by producing and exclusively distributing original contents customized for Netflix’s subscribers, and also succeeded in globalizing at the exponential speed by rapidly transferring original contents to overseas markets. However, Netflix""s backward integration strategy poses a risk of ""double-edged sword"" effect to corporate performance, such as promoting forward integration of external content creators, so it is necessary to consider strategic alternatives such as implementing a platform business model based on two-sided markets from a long-term perspective. The Netflix case provides integrated implications for establishing and implementing a competitive strategy for digital service companies in this age of digital transformation."

The essence of platform business is to leverage network effect in management. Thus platform based management can be rephrased as network management across the business functions.Research on platform business is popular and related to diverse facets. But few scholars cover what the research trend of the domain is. The main purpose of this paper is to identify the research trend on platform business in Korea. To do that we first propose the analytical model for platform architecture whose components are consumers, suppliers, artifacts, and IT platform system. We conjecture that mapping of the research work on platform to the components of the model will make us understand the hidden domain of platform research. We propose three hypotheses regarding the characteristics of research and one proposition for the transitional path from pipeline to platform business model. The mapping is based on the research articles filtered from the Korea Citation Index, using keyword search. Research papers are searched through the keywords provided by authors using the word of “platform”. The filtered articles are summarized in terms of the attributes such as major component of platform considered, platform type, main purpose of the research, and research method.Using the filtered data, we test the hypotheses in exploratory ways. The contribution of our research is as follows: First, based on the findings, scholars can find the areas of research on the domain: areas where research has been matured and territory where future research is actively sought. Second, the proposition provided can give business practitioners the guideline for changing their strategy from pipeline to platform oriented. This research needs to be considered as exploratory not inferential since subjective judgments are involved in data collection, classification, and interpretation of research articles."
시진핑 ‘신시대’ 중국의 정치체제:당국가체제의 ‘진화’와 새로운 패러다임의권위주의체제의 등장,2020,"['시진핑시대', '당국가체제', '강성권위주의체제', '법치', '인민주권', '공산당 영도', '거버넌스체제의 현대화', '중국식 정치체제모델', 'Xi Jinping Era', 'Party-State System', 'Strong Authoritarian System', 'Rule of Law', 'People’s Sovereignty', 'Communist Party Leadership', 'Modernization of Governance System', 'Chinese Model of Political System']","이 글은 “공산당의 영도, 인민주권(人民当家做主), 법치라는 3가지 구성 요소의 유기적 결합”으로 설명되는 ‘중국식’ 민주주의의 주요 원칙에서 출발하여, 공산당 영도와 인민주권원칙 및 공산당 영도와 법치원칙 간에 존재하는 내재적 충돌이라는 두 가지 특징을 분석함으로써, 시진핑 정권 등장 이후 현대적 거버넌스 체제의 구축이라는 이름하에 추진되고 있는 이른바 ‘중국식 정치체제모델’을 공산당의 일원적 통치에 기반한 강화된 권위주의체제로 규정짓고 있다. 이런 ‘강성’ 권위주의체제는 공산당의 일원적 통치원칙에 기반한 전통적 당국가체제의 자기 우량화 과정이고, 민주주의와 헌정주의 원리가 아닌 ‘공산당-민본주의’ 원리에 기초한 권위주의체제로 볼 수 있다. 이것은 황제가 아닌 공산당이라는 공식적 조직에 기초한 통치라는 점에서 ‘황제-민본주의’와 다르다. 법치에 기초한 통치를 강조하지만 고대 제왕의 법치와 유사하게 공산당이 입법을 영도하고 법 집행을 보장하며 사법을 지지하고 법을 지키는 데 앞장선다. 또한 ‘협상’방식을 통한 정치참여를 강조하고 있지만, 이런 방식은 전통시대의 ‘관’과 ‘민’의 소통 방식과 결정적으로 다르지 않다. 그러나 이것은 시장경제체제에 기초하여 비록 제한된 수준이지만 사적 소유에 기초한 다원적 이해관계로 구성된 시민사회가 성장하고 있다는 점에서 전통적 전체주의체제와도 차이가 있다. 바로 이런 점은 시진핑 정부에 의해 제시된 중국의 정치체제의 발전 방향은 새로운 형식의 강성 권위주의체제의 새로운 진화를 꾀하고 그것을 이른바 중국 특색의 정치체제모델로 발전시켜 가려는 것으로 간주할 수 있다. 그리고 이것은 민주적 전환을 전제로 한 과도적 정치체제로 간주되어 온 그동안의 권위주의체제에 대한 학계의 이해와는 근본적으로 다른 새로운 패러다임의 권위주의체제의 등장으로 간주할 수 있다.","This article defines the so-called “Chinese model of the political system,” which has been promoted under the name of establishing a modern governance system since the emergence of the Xi Jinping regime, as a reinforced authoritarian system based on the communist rule. In particular, this paper analyzes the inherent conflicting relations within the main principles of “Chinese” democracy -- the organic combination of the three elements of communist leadership, people’s sovereignty, and the rule of law. This paper also focuses on two specific characteristics of “Chinese” democracy: the implicit conflict between the Communist Party leadership and the principles of people’s sovereignty and the internal conflict between the Communist Party leadership and the rule of law.A strong authoritarian system in China is a self-superiority of the traditional authority system based on the principle of unified governance of the Communist Party. It can be seen as an authoritarian system based on the principle of “communist party-Minbenzhuyi(民本主义)” rather than democracy and constitutionalism, different from ‘emperor- Minbenzhuyi(民本主义)’ in that it is ruled based on the official organization of the Communist Party, not the emperor. While emphasizing rule based on the rule of law, the Communist Party leads legislation, guarantees law enforcement, supports the judiciary, and takes the lead in defending the law, similar to the ancient kings’ rule. It also emphasizes political participation through the “negotiation” method, but this method is not crucially different from the communication method of “gwan(官)” and “min(民)” in the classic era. However, this is also different from the traditional totalitarian system. A market economic system has been established, and, although at a limited level, a civil society composed of pluralistic interests based on private ownership is growing.From this point, we can see that the Xi Jinping administration intends to pursue a new evolution of the strong authoritarian system and to continue this as a model of the so-called Chinese-specific political system. This system, this paper argues, is the emergence of another new paradigm authoritarian system because this is fundamentally different from the academic world’s understanding of the authoritarian system that has been regarded as a transitional political system on the premise of a democratic transformation."

However, it is found that many parents have a tendency to entrust the responsibility of faith transmission to church school rather than to recognize home as a powerful site of faith transmission. Over the past two decades, Christian educators in North America have been aware of the importance of generational discipleship both at church and home by the active participation of parents based on the appropriate equipping education from church. D6 Family Ministry Ministries, founded by Ron Hunter, is a research-institutional curriculum and pastoral research institute based on the theory of family-equipping model.  The purpose of this study is to present the educational implications and directions of Korean churches by critically researching D6 Family Ministry Ministries with attention to generational discipleship based on family-equipping model. To this end, this study identifies the flow of parents-involved ministry in North America, critically analyzes the history, philosophy of education, teaching principles, curriculum, and educational strategies of D6 Family Ministry, and presents the implications and the direction of educational ministry to Korean churches. Through this study, I presented the possibility for the next generation""s faith recovery and revival through the Koreanized family-equipping paradigm in terms of the organic linking between local parish and church school, the reflection of church calendar and school calendar, and balance between discipleship and citizenship. I hope that this study will help Korean churches to be transformed from the consignment of the church school to the responsibility and practice of parents and family, from one hour of Sunday education to full-day faith education, from church as an assignment-institute to church as an equipping-institute."
Study of Permanent Magnet Electrodynamic Suspension System with a Novel Halbach Array,2020,['Halbach array · Permanent magnet electrodynamic suspension · Analytical model · Maxwell stress tensor method · Finite element model'],,"In this paper, a permanent magnet (PM) electrodynamic suspension (EDS) system with a novel Halbach array is presented, to overcome the uncontrol of the levitation force in the PM EDS system. The novel Halbach array consists by winding normal conductor coils on permanent magnets surface. The 2-D analytical expression of the space static magnetic feld is calculated using Biot-savart law and surface current method. When the vehicle-mounted novel Halbach array moves to cut the conductive plate, the space magnetic feld equations are obtained by establishing equations of magnetic vector potentials using complex Fourier transform of space static magnetic feld. The levitation force and drag force are derived using Maxwell stress tensor method. And a 2-D fnite-element model is built to validate the accuracy of this proposed analytical model. Furthermore, the efects of the main characteristic parameters on the levitation force are analysed."

If the 1st generation environmental state is defined as a state that effectively functions to reduce visible environmental pollutants by establishing environmental standards, environmental laws, institutions, organizations, etc. in the 1970s and 1980s, then the 2nd generation environmental state is a state which has responded to climate change through decarbonization policies such as carbon dioxide reduction and renewable energy expansion since the 1990s. Most European countries, which form the leading group of the 2nd generation environmental state, adopt the consensus democracy based on proportional representation election and the corporatism model. However, Europe’s environmental welfare state model still has high ecological footprints, revealing fundamental limitations in responding to ecological crises. In addition, spatio-temporal asymmetry occurs between the carbon dioxide emissions and the victims of climate change, making it difficult for the international community to cooperate in climate change. In this sense, I present the vision of the 3rd generation environmental state for green transformation with the concept of ‘double decommodification’ and ‘enlarged responsibility’ for climate change."

In response, this study analyzed the InsurTech and platform business activities of Ping An Insurance Group Ltd. through the ser-M analysis model to provide strategic implications for revitalizing AI technology-based businesses of domestic insurers. The ser-M analysis model has been studied so that the vision and leadership of the CEO, the historical environment of the enterprise, the utilization of various resources, and the unique mechanism relationships can be interpreted in an integrated manner as a frame that can be interpreted in terms of the subject, environment, resource and mechanism. As a result of the case analysis, Ping An Insurance Group Ltd. has achieved cost reduction and customer service development by digitally innovating its entire business area such as sales, underwriting, claims, and loan service by utilizing core artificial intelligence technologies such as facial, voice, and facial expression recognition. In addition, online data in China and the vast offline data and insights accumulated by the company were combined with new technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data analysis to build a digital platform that integrates financial services and digital service businesses.

First, CEOs of domestic companies also need to recognize the paradigm shift in industry due to the change in digital technology and quickly arm themselves with digital technology-oriented leadership to spearhead the digital transformation of enterprises. Second, the Korean government should urgently overhaul related laws and systems to further promote the use of data between different industries and provide drastic support such as deregulation, tax benefits and platform provision to help the domestic insurance industry secure global competitiveness. Third, Korean companies also need to make bolder investments in the development of artificial intelligence technology so that systematic securing of internal and external data, training of technical personnel, and patent applications can be expanded, and digital platforms should be quickly established so that diverse customer experiences can be"

Specifically, if open phase faults are occurred, the PV system should be stopped by prevention function of islanding of inverter, but it is reported that there are undetected cases for open phase circuit. And also, a phenomenon of open phase circuit may supply reverse power flow in grid-connected transformer. Therefore, this paper proposes modeling of open phase fault using PSCAD/EMTDC S/W and implements test devices to analyze cause of open phase circuit which is occurred at inverter side of PV system.

To this end, the thesis criticizes the present-day community phenomenon from the viewpoint of reformed contextualization and explores the gospel-oriented missionary ecclesiology. Reformed life theology awakens the practical task of the gospel of saving souls and witnessing truth. Therefore, the current situation in which families are disbanded and individual choices and tastes replace community commitment can be said to be the subject of missional research in reformed life theology. The process of contextualization is inevitable in order to carry out the task of biblical criticism and evangelical response to cultural phenomena. This paper first examines contextualization from a reformist point of view, and proposes a critical contextualization that implies biblical truth and transformational orientation. Next, it seeks to understand the crisis of today's relationship and community, and the community phenomenon of tastes and choices corresponding to it. Finally, from the point of view of critical contextualization, we intend to combine the biblical community with discipleship, reflecting on the current cultural phenomenon of community. This is a concrete model of practice, leading to discussions on the missional community. Missionary community is a type of ministry that responds missionally to the relationship and community situation at the crossroads of change today. This ministry has the potential to renew missional ecclesiology, which tends to remain in discourse, into a gospel-centered, conversion-oriented community ministry. Therefore, it is expected that it will be harmonized with the purpose of the reformed life theology pursuing soul salvation and cultural transformation."

However, under the traditional legislative model, the time and cost to collect legislative information are long, the ability to analyze and deal with legislative information is poor, and the efficiency is low. The effect to reflect the social situation and public opinion and to lead the social development in the whole process of legislation is not good enough, and the level of scientific and democratic legislation is not high enough, which leads to passive, inverted and cursory legislation. The ability to collect, analyze and process legislative information has become a key factor to block the process of legislative modernization. In today’s world, the Internet, big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain and other new generation of information technology have been booming, showing the trend of cross-border integration, group intelligence opening, and human-computer cooperation. They have great potential in the field of legislation. They can truly, timely, systematically and effectively gather and feed back the opinions and behavior information of the people, so that the people can realize the intelligent preservation of private freedom and public democracy in every legislation. However, at present, their application scope in the field of legislation is narrow, their application stage is few and their application level is low. The legislation Internet Ecosystem and legislation big data platform needed in the whole process of collecting, analyzing and processing legislation information have not been effectively constructed. The role of legislation knowledge map and legislation blockchain technology has not been fully appllied. Their strategies and paths to support the modernization of legislation need urgent consideration on giving response. Based on the concept of the integration of scientific rationality and legal rationality, this paper firstly defines the intelligent preservation of private domain freedom and public domain democracy as the goal of the new generation of information technology integration and support of modern legislation from the semantic analysis of “legislative modernization”; secondly, it analyzes the performance form, chronic causes, and application of the traditional legislative models which are passive, inverted and cursory. The new generation of information technology promotes the optimization of modern legislative principles and the transformation of traditional legislative model to preventive, step-by-step and precise legislative model. Finally, this paper expounds the optimization plan of the new generation of information technology to support legislative modernization from two aspects of legislative methods and legislative procedures, with a view to improve the quality and establish legislation by applying the new generation of information technology actively and steadily to the legislature. The efficiency of law, the scientific level of legislation and the degree of democratization are helpful."
재고-신규주택 상대가격이 주택공급에 미치는 영향,2020,['-'],,"This thesis investigates relationship between Stock-to-Flow price and housing starts in Seoul metropolitan form 2008 year to 2019 year. The paper tests the relationship through two time-series models such as a vector error correction model and Dynamic Panel regression model. The model results show evidence of positive correlation between Stock-to-Flow price and housing starts in the long run. By transforming the regional data into a panel data set and running a fixed effects model, we test the explanatory power of PBR on housing starts. The result of VECM confirms that one unit uprising PBR raises up apartment construction by 7.4%. This result supports that PBR is a major factor in choosing a start of housing construct. Base on the result of empirical model, We also suggest that the market self-regulation function of housing providers is operating in the entire metropolitan area market."
The Political Economy of Vietnam’s Economic Development: Searching for Nature of the State,2020,"['hard state', 'developmental state', 'Doimoi', 'nature of state', 'geopolitical strategy']",,"Vietnam’s reform policy ‘Doimoi’ adopted in 1986 is a historical turning point of the country’s development. From a centrally planned economy, the state has untied the economy and allowed a series of ‘fence-breaking’ changes to transform itself into a socialist-oriented market one. Throughout the reforming process, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has always played a critical role in creating significant developmental outcomes. Based on Doimoi’s outcomes, there are various approaches aiming to conceptualize Vietnam’s development model such as efforts of flying geese model or developmental state model. However, examining the Vietnamese state under the ‘hard state’ prism is the first time done through this study. The ‘hard state’ approach provides in-depth analyses about the nature of the Vietnamese state which focuses on Vietnamese leadership, the social-political system and insights about various elements of not only economics but also the country’s long course of its social and political development.Findings suggest that the Vietnamese state is characterized as a ‘hard state,’ but also bears the most basic features of a developmental state since Doimoi. This implies that the ‘hard’ nature of the CPV’s leadership has been the key determinant of the successful Doimoi policy. However, a ‘hard state’ merely provides necessary conditions that are required by a developmental state for further rapid growth.Besides that, the geopolitical strategy of the Vietnamese state has always played a critical role in the country’s policy implementation and development process. Therefore, consideration of the nature of the Vietnamese state based on both internal and external perspectives of the hard state and development state model may reflect a better picture over the course of development in Vietnam."

Auto-colorization method used in Image-to-Image conversion based on GAN has received a lot of attention due to its promising results. In this paper, we present a solution to not only colorize the line art but also transform the low resolution out image to match the resolution of the input image through two generators and frequency separation method. A high frequency components are extracted from the line, then two generators are used to colorize the image in low resolution. The high frequency component is merged with low resolution image to produce the high resolution colorized image. The resolution of fi nal output image matches the resolution of original image while preserving the texture of the input image, whereas the other schemes reduce the output image to 512 pixels. We performed visual and qualitative evaluation using FID, PSNR, and SSIM. The FID Score of the proposed method is better than the base model by about 4 (proposed: 47.87 and base model 51.64). PNSR and SSIM of the high-resolution images are also better than the base model. PSNR and SSIM of base model is 13.01 and 0.72 whereas the proposed is 20.77 and 0.86, respectively."

Visualization of user’s attention on objects in 3D environment using only eye tracking glasses,2020,"['eye tracking technology', 'image-based 3D reconstruction', '3D gaze visualization', 'gaze distinction']",,"Eye tracking technology is widely applied to detect user’s attention in a 2D field, such as web page design, package design, and shooting games.

In this research, a methodology is proposed to demonstrate the user’s 3D gaze fixation on a digital model of a scene using only a pair of eye tracking glasses. The eye tracking glasses record user’s gaze data and scene video. Thus, using image-based 3D reconstruction, a 3D model of the scene can be reconstructed from the frame images; simultaneously, the transformation matrix of each frame image can be evaluated to find 3D gaze fixation on the 3D model. In addition, a method that demonstrates multiple users’ 3D gaze fixation on the same digital model is presented to analyze gaze distinction between different subjects. With this preliminary development, this approach shows potential to be applied to a larger environment and conduct a more reliable investigation."
북한의 입법체계 및 법제정비에 관한 연구,2020,"['북한', '경제체제전환', '입법체계', '법제정비', '남북교류협력', '중국', '베트남', 'North Korea', 'Economic Transition', 'Legislative System', 'Legal System Improvement', 'Exchange and Cooperation between South Korea and North Korea', 'China', 'Vietnam']","북한과 같은 잠재적인 경제체제전환국에게는 ‘정치체제’는 기존의 형태를 그대로 유지하면서 ‘경제 부문에서만’ 계획경제로부터 시장경제로 전환한 성공 또는 시행착오에 대한 사례 연구가 필요하다. 그런데 사회주의 일인독재체제나 세습체제에는 민주적 의사 결정의 한계가 있기 때문에 결정적인 순간에 남북교류협력에서도 한계에 봉착할 수밖에 없으므로, 법적 안정성, 예측 가능성, 투명성, 사법적 분쟁해결 절차 등 ‘법치’를 기반으로 한 남북교류협력을 도모해야 할 것으로 여겨진다. 지금까지의 체제전환국 연구는 중부 및 동유럽 국가들에 집중되어 있었는데, 이들은 냉전의 종식, 즉 소련의 붕괴라는 중요한 사건 때문에 정치와 경제를 ‘동시에’ 전환한 국가들이다. 그렇기 때문에 북한이 추구하는 경제체제의 전환과는 다르다고 할 수 있다. 이러한 측면에서 중국, 베트남의 경제체제전환은 북한에 시사하는 바가 많다. 중국과 베트남이 경제성장에 성공하게 되면서 당-국가가 주도하는 ‘점진주의적’ 개혁이 국제사회로부터 주목받게 되었다. 그리고, 국내 연구에서는 중국 모델을 북한 체제에 적용할 수 있을 것인가 또는 북한이 중국 모델을 수용할 것인가에 대해 높은 관심을 표명한 바 있다.중국, 베트남의 사례를 볼 때 경제체제전환을 추진하게 된 배경은 북한의 경우에도 동일하게 적용되고 있으며, 북한이 ‘우리식 경제관리방법’이나 법제개혁을 추진하는 모습은 중국이나 베트남과 유사한 형식으로 경제체제를 전환하려는 것으로 보인다. 북한이 2018년 4월 ‘핵·경제 병진로선’의 역사적 임무의 완성을 선언하고, 전 당과 전국의 모든 역량을 집중하여 사회주의 경제건설을 진행하는 ‘경제건설중심로선’의 실시를 결정함과 동시에 2018년 신년사에서 적극적으로 국제관계 개선을 하겠다고 밝힌 것은 역시 북한이 경제체제전환을 위한 여러 가지 노력을 하고 있는 것으로 여겨진다. 그런데, 한편으로는 UN 중심의 강력한 대북제재가 북한 경제가 이에 적응하고 내구성이 향상되고 있다는 주장도 있고, 2018년 한 해에만 중국인 방북 인원 수가 약 120만 명에 달하고 있다고 한다. 북-미 정상회담도 계속적으로 서로 간의 이견을 좁히지 못하고 교착 상태에 있는 가운데 북한이 생각보다 느리게 경제체제의 전환을 할 가능성도 염두에 둘 수 있다.그런데, 북한이 중국식 경제개혁을 통한 단일전환의 방식으로 ‘경제체제만을 전환’할 경우에 한반도의 통일은 요원한 일이 될 수 있다. 따라서 북한 체제의 변화는 ‘정치체제의 전환’과 시장경제체제의 도입에 따른 ‘경제체제의 전환’이 동시에 이루어져야(이중전환) 할 것이다. 또한 북한의 체제전환은 내부 능력으로는 한계가 있을 수 있으므로 외부 지원이 필요할 수도 있다. 이 경우 남북교류협력도 민감한 부분이 아닌 기본적 내용을 다루는 순수 부문에서 먼저 진행되고, 점차 점진적으로 세세한 내용에 대하여 남한과 북한 간 교류협력을 진행한다면 보다 효과적으로 지원이 이루어질 수 있을 것이다.","Potential economic transition countries such as North Korea need a case study of the success or trial and error of the transition from a planned economy to a market economy, in the economic sector only, while the political regime remains intact. However, since the socialist dictatorship or hereditary system has limitations in democratic decision-making, there is bound to be a limit in exchange cooperation between South Korea and North Korea at the decisive moment. Therefore, it is necessary to promote exchange and cooperation between South Korea and North Korea based on ‘laws’ such as legal stability, predictability, transparency, and judicial dispute resolution procedures. Previous studies of transition economies have focused on central and eastern European countries, which have simultaneously transformed politics and economy because of the important event of the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union. For this reason, it is different from North Korea’s pursuit of economic system. In this regard, the transition of China and Vietnam's economic system has many implications for North Korea. As China and Vietnam succeeded in economic growth, the ‘gradual’ reforms led by the party-state attracted attention from the international community. In addition, domestic research has expressed high interest in whether the Chinese model can be applied to the North Korean system or whether North Korea will accept the Chinese model.In the case of China and Vietnam, the background for promoting economic system change is the same for North Korea, and North Korea’s ‘our economic management method’ or legislative reform is similar to that of China and Vietnam. In April 2018, North Korea declared the completion of the historic mission of the Nuclear and Economic Translation Line, and decided to implement the Economic Construction Center Line, which proceeds with socialist economic construction by concentrating all the capacities of the party and the nation. At the same time, the 2018 New Year's announcement that it will actively improve international relations also indicates that North Korea is making various efforts to transform its economic system. On the other hand, there are some arguments that strong UN sanctions on North Korea have led to the North’s economy adapting to it and improving its durability. In 2018 alone, there were about 1.2 million Chinese visitors to North Korea. North Korea-US summit may not be able to narrow the disagreement, but stalled, and the possibility of North Korea’s transition to the economic system is slower than expected.However, reunification of the Korean peninsula can be far-flung if North Korea ‘transforms its economic system only’ through a single transformation through Chinese economic reform. Therefore, the change in the North Korean system should be carried out at the same time (dual change) by the ‘transition of political system’ and the ‘conversion of the economic system’ following the introduction of the market economy system. In addition, North Korea’s transition may require external support as its internal capacity may be limited. In this case, South-North exchange cooperation will also be implemented more effectively in the pure sector dealing with the basic contents, rather than in the sensitive areas, and if the exchange cooperation between South Korea and North Korea is gradually progressed in detail, the support will be more effective."

In this study, the characteristics of wind pressure that influence wind responses were identified for two different spacings between the twin buildings using a wind tunnel test and the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method. Structural dynamic characteristics were also identified using 3D structural system modeling. The double modal transformation method was utilized to evaluate the characteristics of wind pressure for across-wind and along-wind conditions and the effect of the dynamic characteristics of each structure on the wind responses . The channeling and vortex effects were identified through the POD method. Across-wind loads were significantly affected by the spacings between the twin buildings, whereas along-wind loads were minimally affected. Similarly, while using the double modal transformation method, a significant difference was noticed in case of the cross-participation coefficients in the across-wind direction condition for the different spacings between the buildings; however, the along-wind direction condition showed negligible difference. Therefore, the spacing between the two buildings plays a more important role in across-wind responses compared to along-wind responses."

By identifying individual-focused transformational leadership as a determinant of job-based psychological ownership and work engagement, this paper provides a comprehensive framework to understand the process through which leadership influences individual behavior and motivation toward job performance of front-line employees."
A reliable quasi-dense corresponding points for structure from motion,2020,"['scale-invariant feature transform', 'speeded up robust features', 'structure from motion', 'column space fitting', 'affine-model']",,"A three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is an important research area in computer vision. The ability to detect and match features across multiple views of a scene is a critical initial step. The tracking matrix W obtained from a 3D reconstruction can be applied to structure from motion (SFM) algorithms for 3D modeling. We often fail to generate an acceptable number of features when processing face or medical images because such images typically contain large homogeneous regions with minimal variation in intensity. In this study, we seek to locate sufficient matching points not only in general images but also in face and medical images, where it is difficult to determine the feature points. The algorithm is implemented on an adaptive threshold value, a scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), affine SIFT, speeded up robust features (SURF), and affine SURF. By applying the algorithm to face and general images and studying the geometric errors, we can achieve quasi-dense matching points that satisfy well-functioning geometric constraints. We also demonstrate a 3D reconstruction with a respectable performance by applying a column space fitting algorithm, which is an SFM algorithm."

This research investigates how the digital atmosphere afects consumers’ purchase behavior patterns based on the attention-interest-desire-searchaction-share (AIDSAS) model. The fndings show that attention is a key antecedent to interest, desire, and behavioral responses (search, action, and share) triggered by the digital atmosphere. The fndings further suggest that attention has signifcantly positive efects on consumers’ purchasing patterns of utilizing the digital atmosphere in two types of fashion retail stores: sports and luxury stores. However, we fnd that these positive efects are more pronounced for sports retail stores than luxury retail stores.This research contributes to understanding consumer behavior related to the digital atmosphere of fashion retail stores by applying the AIDSAS model and helps uncover the stepwise relationships between attention to the store atmosphere-interest/desire and the products-behavior response. These fndings have practical implications that can be applied in the fashion industry."

"Applying the tourist life cycle concept to the evolution of commercial areas using density, diversity, and land price",2020,"['Commercial area', 'Tourist attraction life cycle model', 'Portfolio analysis', 'Business density', 'Business diversity', 'Land price growth rate']",,"It is a globally recognized phenomenon that commercial areas serve as spaces of affluent, leisure consumption. Nonetheless, the topic of retail change remains poorly theorized. Views on commercial area changes are beginning to be challenged, however, with the acknowledgement that the fundamental importance of retail change is in instigating gentrification. From the perspective of the business life cycle, retail changes can affect the opening, closing, and duration of businesses. With the growth of tourism worldwide, commercial locations have the potential to transform, gentrify, and become urban attractions and tourist destinations. The tourist attraction life cycle model (TALC) may be applicable to commercial areas when they are thus conceptualized as tourist attractions. This study examined the applicability of a life cycle model—development, consolidation, stagnation, and decline—to the process of change of commercial areas to identify patterns. We attempted to define change in commercial areas in terms of business density, diversity, and changes in land prices using micro data from business enterprises in Seoul (1996-2016) from the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The results showed that there were four patterns of commercial area change in the portfolio analysis. Applying the TALC, we found that commercial areas passed through four life cycle stages in a manner that might be best explained using the complexity theory."

The alginates were extracted and purified via three different routes (CaCl2, HCl and ethanol routes), and their rheological properties at various concentrations and temperatures were determined. The yield of fucoidan was 3.08%, and it was mainly composed of fucose and galactose. Fourier-transform infrared spectrum of fucoidan showed strong absorption band at 1,254 and 827 cm-1 corresponding to the sulfate group. Flow behavior of the alginate solution was characterized using the power-law model. The consistency index increased with increasing concentrations. The sodium alginate solution (1.5%) exhibited Newtonian behavior when extracted via the CaCl2 and HCl routes, while it exhibited pseudoplastic behavior when extracted via the ethanol route. The effect of temperature on the flow behavior was investigated in terms of the activation energy (Ea), which was obtained using the Arrhenius equation. The Ea value corresponding to the alginate solution decreased with increasing shear rates. The Ea values corresponding to the alginate solutions purified via the CaCl2, HCl, and ethanol routes were 13.54-18.64 kJ/mol, 13.42-19.21 kJ/mol, and 9.51-10.67 kJ/mol, respectively. The low Ea values corresponding to the solutions extracted via the ethanol route suggest that the flow behavior does not depend significantly on temperature."
A rub fault recognition method based on generative adversarial nets,2020,['· Generative adversarial nets · Rubbing fault recognition · Feature transform · Adversarial training'],,"Faced with the problem of valid data shortage data in practical. There's not enough data to train classifiers which can be satisfied to detect impact-rubbing faults in rotary machine. Bedsides, the large number of noises in working enviroment make the useful signal contaminated. Based on this problem, this paper proposes a rubbing fault recognition method based on a generative adversarial nets named deep convolution generative adversarial nets (DCGAN), which is based on a deep convolutional network frame with generation and discrimination models. The acquired signal is processed by time frequency analysis further to get spectrogram. The DCGAN can perform feature conversion and map it to the potential feature subspace to obtain more robust features. The results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve a much more excellent recognition effect. Thus, the proposed DCGAN model is an effective way to recognize impact-rubbing fault in the practical."

The proposed approach partitions the host model into smaller sub meshes and generates a secret watermark from the sub meshes using Weber Law. ACO based optimized strength factor is identified for embedding the watermark. The secret watermark is embedded and extracted on the wavelet domain. The proposed scheme is robust against geometric and photometric attacks that overcomes the synchronization problem and authenticates the secret watermark from the distorted models. The primary characteristic of the proposed system is the flexibility achieved in data embedding capacity due to the optimized strength factor. Extensive simulation results shows enhanced performance of the recommended framework and robustness towards the most common attacks like geometric transformations, noise, cropping, mesh smoothening, and the combination of such attacks."

The results of analysis are as follows: The minimum wage system was introduced to correct the problem of low wages if wages, which are the cost of labor, are left to competition between users and workers in the market in terms of social policy. The minimum wage policy decisions stipulated by the Minimum Wage Act are to be calculated by “corporatism,” as an official and closed negotiation coordination system between representatives of labor, management, and the public interest, at the Minimum Wage Commission. However, the Moon Jae-in government’s policy decisions on the minimum wage in 2018 are changing the characteristic of the policy network from corporatism to “pressure pluralism.” The reason for this shift is changes in the characteristics and structure of government, the spread of interest groups leading monopolization, and division of interest. Moreover, although the government and interest groups carried out their functional behavior, there were complex negotiations and adjustments, and conflict and cooperation between the two sides coexisted. These findings may suggest the characteristics of the nation’s policy decision making and interest intermediation, along with the direction of how the government should make policy decisions."

Framework for Automated Generation of Constructible Steel Erection Sequences Using Structural Information of Static Indeterminacy Variation in BIM,2020,"['Automatic scheduling', 'Automation', 'Building information modeling (BIM)', 'Constructability', 'Construction planning', 'Structural stability']",,"For effective pre-construction process, engineers create a 4D building information model (BIM). However, the rich information associated with the creation of the 4D BIM leads to manual effort. Past studies explored methods that automatically generate construction schedules using 3D building models. However, no method properly utilized relationships between building elements to robustly generate 4D BIMs that are structural stable during installation. This research presents an approach to the automated generation of structurally stable construction sequences using a 3D BIM. Focusing on steel erection, we create a framework integrating a 3D BIM and algorithms to create a 4D BIM with detailed steel erection sequences of individual elements. This research explores an approach to a variation of static indeterminacy for each installation process of steel elements. The principle of this approach is based on the relationships among the nodes and the connections among steel elements, information about which is available to those involved in the project. For validation, we test a prototype software program using a BIM for a real-world construction project. The results indicate that the prototype utilizing the static indeterminacy variation could generate a large number of random sequences and successfully transforms them into stable sequences. This study establishes the foundational step of generating constructible sequences using structural information in BIM which is found to be more robust than previous approaches, and results of this study can lead to follow up studies for full automation such as automated analysis and optimization of the sequences."

AGNWSP had higher tensile strength, lower bioabsorbability, and higher sustainedTGF-β1 release capacity than AGNW, which were highly correlated with tendon regeneration. AGNW and AGNWSP werefixed to the ruptured tendon-to-bone sites, and fresh solutions of TGF-β1 were injected into the scaffolds. When AGNWSPwas applied, the repaired supraspinatus tendon had higher ultimate failure load and stress. In addition, well-organizedcollagen fibers and fibrocartilages were observed at the tendon-to-bone interface in this case. It is suggested that high degreeof ruptured rotator cuff healing could be achieved with AGNWSP in combination with TGF-β1."

First, we describe the defect detection model. mean filter is applied to preprocess the acquired image. Then, Sobel operator (SO) is applied to deal with the defect image, and we can get a coarse binary image. Finally, the binary image can be divided into many patches. For a given patch, a threshold is used to decide whether the patch is defect-free or not. Finally, a new image will be reconstructed, and we did a loop for the reconstructed image to suppress defects noise. Experiments show that the proposed SOPS algorithm is effective."

Transacting L2 Writer Identity in Remote Learning During COVID-19: An Activity Theory Approach,2020,"['COVID-19', 'remote writing', 'L2 writer identity', 'activity theory', 'Swales’ genre analysis']",,"The recent phenomenon of school closures caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic has dramatically transformed the way we teach and learn in educational institutions globally. Such changes will have profound effects on a number of issues related to teaching L2 writing. Accordingly, focusing on this abrupt shift from in-school instruction to remote learning, we examined how the L2 students constructed and transformed their remote academic discourse communities, wherein their writer identity was initially projected and later reprojected through L2 written practices. Drawing from data collected in a case study of writing activities of two Korean EFL college students, we investigated how these students positioned themselves as writers within the activity system of the remote learning environment, making particular rhetorical choices in academic writing. To achieve this objective, we adopted a genetic method which tracks development of a student’s identity, employing Vygotskian sociocultural theory, together with activity theory, and Swales’ (1990) genre analysis model. Our study showed that the two students exploited the shift to remote learning as the affordances for a new, academic writer identity construction. Thus, we suggest a new line of inquiry to add understanding of identity constructions, especially during this sudden change in educational contexts."
Advanced Spectral-Ratio Radon Background Estimate in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry and Calibration Technology,2020,"['Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry', 'Radon background estimate', 'New calibration coefficient', 'Monte Carlo simulation']",,"This paper discusses an advanced spectral-ratio method that subtracts Compton scattering rays by using a Fast Fourier Transform rather than tripping ratios and establishes a new radon background estimation mathematical model. A ground model calibration technology and a non-radioactive calibration technology based on a multiple-step Monte Carlo simulation are proposed for determining the new calibration coefficients. Applying the new calibration coefficients by using the two calibration technologies, we can remove successfully from the U window. The relative standard deviation of the radon-corrected U window count between the two calibration technologies is less than 30% within the height of the airborne survey, and it is reduced as the height increases."
Research on the CNC incremental forming method of the special-shaped sheet metal part with the 3D top edge lines,2020,['· 3D top edge lines · CNC incremental forming · Optimal datum plane · Special-shaped sheet metal part · Surface filling'],,"Aiming at the problem that the special-shaped sheet metal part with 3D top edge lines is difficult to form directly, this paper proposed a method of transforming the 3D top edge lines into the planar top edge lines by filling the surface to realize its CNC incremental forming. Firstly, the optimal datum plane for the surface filling was determined by using the multi-objective decision making method according to the formability, forming depth, filling area, and other factors. Then, the vacant area between the datum plane and the sheet part was filled. Finally, the forming toolpath for the forming process was generated using the filled model.The forming quality of the formed sheet part was analyzed by using the numerical simulation, and the sheet metal parts was formed by the forming experiment. The results show that the maximum and minimum deviation in the Z-axis direction between the experimental part contour and the designed model contour in the Z-axis direction are 0.4672 mm and 0.0096 mm, respectively. While the maximum and minimum thickness are 0.698 mm and 0.533 mm, respectively."

The fundamental potential of platforms has made the expression ‘transformation from a pipeline market to a platform market’ familiar, and the success of several giant platforms has led to unprecedented market assessments in a relatively short period of time.The increasingly powerful influence of platforms in the digital economy has left a new challenge of adjusting competition law and competition policies to address the ongoing problem of ‘competition in the future’ in line with changing business models. Some commentators are seeking the ways that existing competition law systems can be applied to new business models. On the other hand, others are attempting to theorize the impacts technology can have on competition, pointing out that there is a limit to the application of the current competition law systems to the platform business.Traditionally, competition law’s interest in the platform market was focused on network effects and market planning. Recently, however, there have been remarkable changes in the perspective toward the platform business, such as the market design of platforms with intermediation functions, rules (such as fees charged when participating, data sharing conditions, etc.) that must be observed by participants within a platform. These recent changes in the perspective pay attention to the platform market leaders’ ability to create markets by their own intentions.Challenges of the digital economy in the 21 century arise from the rapid expansion of the platform industry’s scale as well as a trend of diversification and the use of data. To address these challenges, a sufficient review of changes in the market and industry will first be required. Also, it is essential to have the process of ensuring that the platforms’ specificity is reflected and considered in competition law and its enforcement system. Besides, the data that users provide to platforms is intertwined with the market forces created by the accumulation of data. Hence, when it comes to the implementation of competition law in the digital economy, it is necessary to integrate and identify, from a long-term perspective, the interfaces between competition law and consumer protection/data protection. Furthermore, the issue of protecting the competition process should also be carefully considered. Through this process, cautiously designed regulations can provide the market with clarity and predictability about the range of acceptable competition, thereby effectively regulating powerful market players’ attempt to restrict competition while minimizing the dynamic nature of the digital market and any negative impacts on the technological innovation."
Is Trade Integration Leading to Regionalization? Evidence from Cross-Country Network Analysis,2020,"['Trade Intensity Indices', 'Network Analysis', 'Regionalization', 'Trade Integration', 'Trade Introversion.']",,"The present paper empirically analyzes the structural change in world trade over the last two decades by examining trade integration, leadership, and regionalization through a network model. We selected 50 countries encompassing both developed and developing nations and grouped them into 9 regions for 1990, 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2017. We have undertaken two principal analyses: (i) trade intensity indices and regionalization and (ii) linking trade intensity with network analysis. Therefore, this paper reaches a trade-off condition. The major findings of the study are as follows: (i) regional integration is stronger and has increased over the years; (ii) trade regionalization is primarily dominated by developed regions; (iii) trade liberalization has reduced the gap between the center and periphery; (iv) emerging Asian economies have developed as leaders and export hubs of goods in the global market; (v) trade liberalization has transformed and reshaped the world trade structure; and (vi) trade liberalization has not driven the lessening geodesic distance and transport costs from trade, and thus, there are no major gains for many countries."

Transforming large industrial wastelands like Ruhr into a thriving urban space requires active intervention from both the government and the public. In this aspect, the innovation policy governance of Germany is considered as a reference model. One of its features is public-private cooperation where the government is in charge of planning and implementation, while experts and civic organizations also play important roles. The urban regeneration of industrial heritage areas of Ruhr was a comprehensive multidisciplinary project with various parties of interest. The role and capabilities of the governing body to lead and mediate the complex project with involvement from various parties were extremely important. This study focuses on the historical background of the governance through public consensus. It aims to emphasize the fact that the governance system operating in Ruhr was the fruit of a political culture based on the social capitalism that emerged from the process of long-term deindustrialization after 1945. First, the study explores the risk of the coal-mining and steel industry, the increasing influence of the trade union, and the implementation of the co-determination system since the 1950s. Further, the study examines the social democratization of the Ruhr District that guaranteed the stability of the deindustrialization structural policies. Finally, the study explores the integration of structural policies with the urban regeneration of industrial areas as well as the establishment and characteristics of the innovative governance after the 1970s."
Adsorption isotherms and kinetics for the removal of cationic dye by Cellulose-based adsorbent biocomposite films,2020,"['Cellulose Biocomposite Film', 'Isotherm', 'Activated Carbon', 'Methylene Blue Adsorption', 'Kinetic']",,"Various fillers (commercial, nipa palm, sisal activated carbon, zeolite) were incorporated with regenerated cellulose matrix that dissolved using lithium chloride/N, N-dimethylacetamide solution. The biosorbent films were successfully prepared via solution casting and then characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), Xray Diffractometer (XRD), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The biocomposite films with embedded commercial activated carbon exhibited the largest adsorption capacity of methylene blue (146.81mg g1). Although the adsorption ability of the nipa palm and sisal activated carbon biocomposite was lower than the commercial activated carbon biosorbent film, both nipa palm and sisal activated carbon still could potentially be used as an alternative filler for cationic dye removal. On the contrary, zeolite had low adsorption efficiency owing to its morphology. The equilibrium adsorption experiment revealed that the Langmuir isotherm model best fitted the biocomposite films with commercial and sisal activated carbon, whereas the Freundlich adsorption model suited the biosorbent films with nipa palm activated carbon and zeolite than other models. The kinetics results of adsorption for all biocomposite films were well described using a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The cellulose/activated carbon films would be promisingly utilized as a biosorbent for treatment of dye-contaminated wastewater."

We further defined the role of Lin28a in transforming growth factor (TGF)-signaling pathways in renal fibrosis through in vitro study using human tubular epithelium-like HK-2 cells. In the mouse unilateral ureteral obstruction model, obstruction markedly decreased the expression of Lin28a, increased the expression of renal fibrotic markers such as type I collagen, α-SMA, vimentin and fibronectin. In TGF-β-stimulated HK-2 cells, the expression of Lin28a was reduced and the expression of renal fibrotic markers such as type I collagen, α-SMA, vimentin and fibronectin was increased. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Lin28a inhibited the expression of TGF-β-stimulated type I collagen, α-SMA, vimentin and fibronectin. Lin28a inhibited TGF-β-stimulated SMAD3 activity, via inhibition of SMAD3 phosphorylation, but not the MAPK pathway ERK, JNK or p38.

The more understanding the text, the more assessments are produced. Establishing authorship, which is ultimate goal of teaching academic writing is more related to assessment skills. This is the reason for focusing on the studies on reading-writing teaching models. In this study, I examined the relationship between the change in students' thought and selecting a specific topic for a book review. The book selected for review deals with classification in big data society and surveillance and the movie chosen as a stimulus focuses on online observation. I assessed the change in thought before and after watching movie and I compared it with the students' book reviews to examine the relationship between change in thought and the tendency to select a specific topic. I used SPSS program to perform a cross analysis for this process. The results showed that students who originally thought about online observation tended to select surveillance as the topic of their review more than those who did not. This can be explained using L.Vygotsky’s concept of “inner speech”. Vygotsky discovered it in children at the stage of learning the language. He proposed that the inner speech area is usually activated in children to solve problems. Inner sppech is distinct from outer speech, which is used for communication with others. This concept of inner speech can also apply to adults’ cognitive processes. By applying Vygotsky’s theory the results of this study, I proposed that students who thought about online observation prepared the inner speech area in combination with emotional and motivational aspects. Watching the movie activated this area and they easily converted their inner speech into Abstract outer speech based on their emotion and motivation. However, students who did not think about online observation could not prepare their inner speech area in this manner. They cognitively modified their thought, without combining it with emotion and motivation and thus faced. Difficulty in turning transforming thought into a specific language. This result can be significantly interpreted using F. Weaver’s research, which emphasizes writers’ self-initiated-transition about certain topic with stimulus. Additionally, students’ change of thought is unrelated to the stage of organizing evidences during the book review. Organization is related more to an individual’s task representation and their discussison of the problem with other students. Teachers should mention the contents of stimulus is unrelated to teachers’ opinions and discussion should be accompanied to using stimulus for students’ creative thought."

Dynamic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis tests at heating rates in the range from 5 to 40 oC/min were carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) coupled to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) to determine the kinetic parameters of the process and for online detection of evolved gasses. Pyrolytic decomposition of OS included a multi-stage decomposition process, while PET decomposed only in a single step. The kinetics of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis was determined via model-free iso-conversional methods, namely Friedman, FWO, Starink, Vyazovkin, in a conversion degree range of 0.1-0.9. The kinetic models were validated with the obtained data to describe pyrolytic and copyrolytic degradation mechanisms, and the regression coefficients were between 0.9823 and 0.9999. The results showed that the activation energy of co-pyrolysis was evidently lower than that of PET or OS pyrolysis. This led to the conclusion that co-pyrolysis could be a potential method for obtaining shale oil due to the synergy between OS and PET."

Transport and mixing processes related to the seasonal variation of TTL ozone are examined using the tracer transport equation based on the transformed Eulerian mean, and the results are compared to previously proposed values from model analyses. The analysis shows that the seasonal variability of TTL ozone is mainly determined by two processes: vertical mean transport and horizontal eddy mixing of ozone, with different contributions in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The horizontal eddy mixing process explains the major portion of the seasonal cycle in the northern TTL, while the vertical mean transport dominates in the southern TTL. The Asian summer monsoon likely contributes to this observed difference. The ozone variability and related processes in MERRA-2 reanalysis show qualitatively similar features with satellite- and model-based analyses, and it provides advantages of fine-scale analyses. However, it still shows significant quantitative biases in ozone budget analysis."

Traditional image interpolation methods, such as bi-linear interpolation, bi-cubic interpolation and edge direction-based interpolation, perform interpolation in the spatial domain. Recently, interpolation techniques in the discrete cosine transform or wavelet domain are also proposed. Using these various existing interpolation methods and machine learning, we propose decision tree classification-based image interpolation methods. In other words, this paper is about the method of adaptively applying various existing interpolation methods, not the interpolation method itself. To obtain the decision model, we used Weka's J48 library with the C4.5 decision tree algorithm. The proposed method first constructs attribute set and select classes that means interpolation methods for classification model. And after training, interpolation is performed using different interpolation methods according to attributes characteristics. Simulation results show that the proposed method yields reasonable performance."

DISTRIBUTED H∞ CONTROL OF PLATOON INTERACTED BY SWITCHING AND UNDIRECTED TOPOLOGY,2020,"['Vehicular platoon', 'Robust performance', 'Distributed control', 'System decoupling']",,"To deal with the challenges caused by the weakness of wireless communication, this paper presents a distributed H ∞ control strategy for platooning of automatic vehicles (AVs) connected by switching and undirected topologies.With the compensation of the powertrain nonlinearities by an inverse model, the node dynamics is described by a linear system with bounded uncertainty. Then the platoon system controlled by a distributed state-feedback controller is decomposed into multiple low order subsystems by applying the eigenvalue decomposition and linear transformation. The open gain of these subsystems dependends on the eigenvalues of the topological matrix. The sufficient condition for the H ∞ performance of platoon is proved by using the invariant of signal amplitude of the linear transformation. A numerical way is further provided to solve the distributed controller by using the LMI approach. For this new synthesis method, only the bounds of the topological eigenvalues are necessary. And the designed state-feedback can control the platoon composed of disturbed nodes and interacted by uncertain even switching topologies in a satisfactory way. The effectiveness of this distributed H ∞ control strategy is validated by comparative bench tests between nominal and disturbed conditions."
Numerical study on the effect of the tip clearance of a 100 HP axial fan on the aerodynamic performance and unsteady stall characteristics,2020,['· Aerodynamic performance · Axial fan · Stall characteristics · Tip clearance'],,"In this study, a numerical analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of the tip clearance on the aerodynamic performance, internal flow characteristics, and stall region characteristics of an axial fan. Three-dimensional steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculations were conducted with a shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model. Tip clearance ratios of 0, 0.01, and 0.02 were applied to the impeller. As the tip clearance ratio increased, the aerodynamic performance of the axial fan decreased at both the design and the off-design conditions. The correlation between the tip leakage vortex (TLV) and the flow angle of the velocity triangle was presented for the difference in the tip clearance and flow rate. As the flow rate increased, the differences in the aerodynamic performance induced by the tip clearance ratio decreased. As the tip clearance ratio increased, the size of the TLV increased and gradually moved in the circumferential direction to interfere with the main flow at the low flow rate. Meanwhile, the size of the TLV was similar and gradually moved in the axial direction even if the tip clearance ratio increased at the high flow rate. The pressure fluctuations were observed by the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analysis to compare and analyze internal flow characteristics at the stall region and design point. The static pressure was converted to the appropriate magnitude. The locations of the highest magnitude were shown to be different at the stall region and the design point, respectively."
Artificial neural network calculations for a receding contact problem,2020,"['contact problem', 'artificial neural network', 'quarter plane', 'multilayer perceptron', 'theory of elasticity']",,"This paper investigates the artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the dimensionless parameters for the maximum contact pressures and contact areas of a contact problem. Firstly, the problem is formulated and solved theoretically by using Theory of Elasticity and Integral Transform Technique. Secondly, the contact problem has been extended based on the ANN. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) with three-layer was used to calculate the contact distances. External load, distance between the two quarter planes, layer heights and material properties were created by giving examples of different values were used at the training and test stages of ANN. Program code was rewritten in C++. Different types of network structures were used in the training process. The accuracy of the trained neural networks for the case was tested using 173 new data which were generated via theoretical solutions so as to determine the best network model. As a result, minimum deviation value (difference between theoretical and C++ ANN results) of was obtained for the network model. Theoretical results were compared with artificial neural network results and well agreements between them were achieved."
"Three-dimensional double-network hydrogels of graphene oxide, alginate, and polyacrylonitrile for copper removal from aqueous solution",2020,"['Adsorbent', 'Copper', 'Double network', 'Graphene oxide', 'Polymer', 'Wastewater']",,"Three-dimensional (3D) double-network graphene oxide/alginate-polyacrylonitrile (GO/Ca-Alg₂-PAN) composite hydrogels were synthesized via surface functionalization of GO to activate adsorption sites. The morphology and structure of the GO/Ca-Alg₂-PAN were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DSC). The results of the physicochemical analyses indicated that GO/Ca-Alg₂-PAN was successfully synthesized by the combination of a 2D -structured graphene oxide with the alginate which was functionalized with the PAN polymer to generate the 3D double network composites. This functionalization approach contributed to an increase in Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> ion adsorption capacity. The maximum adsorption capacity of the GO/Ca-Alg₂-PAN for Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> was 5.99 mmol/g.

However, under the traditional legislative model, the time and cost to collect legislative information are long, the ability to analyze and deal with legislative information is poor, and the efficiency is low. The effect to reflect the social situation and public opinion and to lead the social development in the whole process of legislation is not good enough, and the level of scientific and democratic legislation is not high enough, which leads to passive, inverted and cursory legislation. The ability to collect, analyze and process legislative information has become a key factor to block the process of legislative modernization.In today’s world, the Internet, big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain and other new generation of information technology have been booming, showing the trend of cross-border integration, group intelligence opening, and human-computer cooperation. They have great potential in the field of legislation. They can truly, timely, systematically and effectively gather and feed back the opinions and behavior information of the people, so that the people can realize the intelligent preservation of private freedom and public democracy in every legislation. However, at present, their application scope in the field of legislation is narrow, their application stage is few and their application level is low. The legislation Internet Ecosystem and legislation big data platform needed in the whole process of collecting, analyzing and processing legislation information have not been effectively constructed. The role of legislation knowledge map and legislation blockchain technology has not been fully appllied. Their strategies and paths to support the modernization of legislation need urgent consideration on giving response.Based on the concept of the integration of scientific rationality and legal rationality, this paper firstly defines the intelligent preservation of private domain freedom and public domain democracy as the goal of the new generation of information technology integration and support of modern legislation from the semantic analysis of “legislative modernization”; secondly, it analyzes the performance form, chronic causes, and application of the traditional legislative models which are passive, inverted and cursory. The new generation of information technology promotes the optimization of modern legislative principles and the transformation of traditional legislative model to preventive, step-by-step and precise legislative model. Finally, this paper expounds the optimization plan of the new generation of information technology to support legislative modernization from two aspects of legislative methods and legislative procedures, with a view to improve the quality and establish legislation by applying the new generation of information technology actively and steadily to the legislature. The efficiency of law, the scientific level of legislation and the degree of democratization are helpful."
An Educational Approach to Theodicy : ‘Experiential Theodicy’ for the Sick through Spiritual Mentoring,2020,"['Theodicy', 'Educational Approach', 'Experiential Theodicy', 'the Sick', 'Spiritual Mentoring', 'Christian Educators']",,"The purpose of this study is to put forth an educational approach to theodicy. I propose an ‘experiential theodicy’ through spiritual mentoring for the sick, who suffer one of the most prevalent suffering in the world. The methodology for this study is a modified version of R. R. Osmer’s ‘Consensus model’ of practical theology. I begin with a descriptive section that includes for context the concrete story of a sick man whom I had the chance to observe in a pastoral role and descriptions of three theological responses to his suffering: atheistic rage, understanding of sickness as punishment, and communal participation. In the interpretive section, I systematically explore diverse themes and types of theodicy in light of these theological responses: theoretical theodicy, practical theodicy, and the integrated view of the two. In the normative section, I select useful elements for an effective theodicy for the sick from critical discussions on the themes of theodicy: the sufferer’s voice, the compassionate God who suffers with the sick, emotional/spiritual healing within transformative suffering, and spiritual growth. With these elements, in the fourth, normative section I formulate an ‘experiential theodicy’ as an effective theodicy for the sick. In the final, pragmatic section, I show that the practice of spiritual mentoring can play an effective facilitating role in the process of experiential theodicy, and thus propose spiritual mentoring as the most suitable educational method for the sick. As conclusion, I argue that ‘experiential theodicy’ should be regarded as an effective educational approach to the sick. ‘Experiential theodicy’ has its purpose and method in common with Christian education, spiritual growth and mentoring, which allows ‘experiential theodicy’ to function as an educational approach to theodicy. Thus, this new type of spiritual mentoring for the sick should be added to the repertoire of the ministry of Christian educators."
Tillage boundary detection based on RGB imagery classification for an autonomous tractor,2020,"['autonomous tractor', 'convolutional neural networks', 'deep learning', 'path detection', 'tractor tillage']",,"In this study, a deep learning-based tillage boundary detection method for autonomous tillage by a tractor was developed, which consisted of image cropping, object classification, area segmentation, and boundary detection methods. Full HD (1920 × 1080) images were obtained using a RGB camera installed on the hood of a tractor and were cropped to 112 × 112 size images to generate a dataset for training the classification model. The classification model was constructed based on convolutional neural networks, and the path boundary was detected using a probability map, which was generated by the integration of softmax outputs.The results show that the F1-score of the classification was approximately 0.91, and it had a similar performance as the deep learning-based classification task in the agriculture field. The path boundary was determined with edge detection and the Hough transform, and it was compared to the actual path boundary. The average lateral error was approximately 11.4 cm, and the average angle error was approximately 8.9º. The proposed technique can perform as well as other approaches; however, it only needs low cost memory to execute the process unlike other deep learning-based approaches. It is possible that an autonomous farm robot can be easily developed with this proposed technique using a simple hardware configuration."
Rotor ground-fault diagnosis methods for synchronous condensers based on amplitude and phase-angle of voltage,2020,"['Fault diagnosis', 'Fault detection', 'Ground-fault resistance (GFR)', 'Grounding resistance (GR)', 'Rotor ground fault', 'Synchronous condensers']",,"A single ground fault of the rotor windings in a synchronous condenser can cause serious damage if the fault is not eliminated in time. This paper proposes a new rotor ground-fault diagnosis method for synchronous condensers based on the amplitude of the 150 Hz component of the voltage across a grounding resistance (GR) placed in the neutral of an excitation transformer. It can be seen that the amplitude of the 150 Hz component of the voltage across the GR increases with a decrease of the ground-fault resistance (GFR). This method is an improvement of existing algorithms for rotor ground-fault detection that requires less analyzing and can achieve online detection of the severity of a rotor ground fault at any point of the excitation winding. In addition, the influence of different excitation voltages on the algorithm based on phase-angle is analyzed considering actual working characteristics. Moreover, a model is built in the MATLAB/Simulink platform using the real parameters of a TTS-300-2 synchronous condenser to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, a dual diagnostic criterion is given according to the results of simulations. The research conclusions can have a great significance on the healthy running of synchronous condensers and they can help to drastically reduce both cost and repair time."

Korean Red Ginseng alleviates dehydroepiandrosterone-induced polycystic ovarian syndrome in rats via its antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities,2020,"['Dehydroepiandrosterone', 'Korean Red Ginseng extract', 'Polycystic ovarian syndrome']",,"Background: Beneficial effects of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) on polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) remains unclear. Methods: We examined whether pretreatment (daily from 2 hours before PCOS induction) with KRG extract in water (KRGE; 75 and 150 mg/kg/day, p.o.) could exert a favorable effect in a dehydroepian-drosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS rat model. Results: Pretreatment with KRGE significantly inhibited the elevation of body and ovary weights, the increase in number and size of ovarian cysts, and the elevation of serum testosterone and estradiol levels induced by DHEA. Pretreatment with KRGE also inhibited macrophage infiltration and enhanced mRNA expression levels of chemokines [interleukin (IL)-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6), and inducible nitric oxide synthase in ovaries induced by DHEA. It also prevented the reduction in mRNA expression of growth factors (epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta (EGF, TGF-β)) related to inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell pathway and stimulation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 pathway. Interestingly, KRGE or representative ginsenosides (Rb1, Rg1, and Rg3(s)) inhibited the activity of inflammatory enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 and iNOS, cytosolic p-IκB, and nuclear p-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 cells, whereas they increased nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 nuclear translocation. Conclusion: These results provide that KRGE could prevent DHEA-induced PCOS via antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities. Thus, KRGE may be used in preventive and therapeutic strategies for PCOS-like symptoms."

Conclusions: Colorectal stricture had the highest risk for malignant transformation.Earlier initiation of colonoscopic surveillance in UC patients with risk factors for stricture should be considered to prevent stricture formation and further malignant transformation."
A novel data-driven rollover risk assessment for articulated steering vehicles using RNN,2020,['· Articulated steering vehicles · Lateral stability · Data-driven · Recurrent neural network · Rollover risk'],,"Articulated steering vehicles have outstanding capability operating but suffer from frequent rollover accidents due to their complicated structure. It is necessary to accurately detect their rollover risk for drivers to take action in time. Their variable structure and the variable center of mass exhibit nonlinear time-variant behavior and increase the difficulty of dynamic modelling and lateral stability description. This paper proposes a novel data-driven modelling methodology for lateral stability description of articulated steering vehicles. The running data is first collected based on the typical operations that prone to rollover and then classified into two types: Safety and danger. The data quality is further improved by wavelet transformation. Finally, an RNN model is built on the data. The experimental results show that the output of the RNN model can accurately quantify lateral stability of the vehicle, i.e., the risk of rollover, when it is turning and crossing uneven surfaces or obstacles."

Data wereextracted from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (weighted sample of 609,787 US adults)from 2007 to 2014. Using the behavioral model of health services utilization, characteristicsof cancer patients were examined and compared among uterine, cervical, and ovarian cancerpatients. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted on medical expenditure witha prior logarithmic transformation.Results: The estimated annual medical expenditure attributed to gynecologic cancers was$3.8 billion, with an average cost of $6,293 per patient. The highest annual cost per personwas ovarian cancer ($13,566), followed by uterine cancer ($6,852), and cervical cancer($2,312). The major components of medical costs were hospital inpatient stays (53%, $2.03billion), followed by office-based visits (15%, $559 million), and outpatient visits (13%, $487million). Two key prescription expenditures were antineoplastic hormones (10.3%) andanalgesics (9.2%). High expenditures were significantly associated with being a marriedwoman (p<0.001), having private health insurance (p<0.001), being from a low- and middle income family (p<0.001), or living in the Midwest or the South (p<0.001).Conclusion: The key risk factors and components were well described for the economicburden of gynecologic cancers. With a growing population of cancer patients, efforts toreduce the burden of gynecologic cancers are warranted."
The Study on the Possibility of Christian Education through Metaphor:Based on the Comparative Study between “Conceptual Metaphor” Theory and “the Forms” of Maria Harris,2020,"['conceptual metaphor', 'forms', 'formation', 'transcendence', 'Christian metaphors', '개념은유', '형태', '형성', '초월', '기독교적 은유']",,"This study examines whether Christian education is possible through metaphor theory or not. Can metaphor be a way in Christian education that enables people to understand Christian faith, to form a Christian as well as to communicate with Christian traditions and future generations? Can metaphor be an alternative in Christian education to transform and shape people as Christians who are facing the new situation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the Post-Covid 19 era? In order to confirm that metaphor can be a response to these questions, this study explored the conceptual metaphor theory encompassing the dimensions of the linguistic metaphor theory, and finally discovered the Christian educational nature of metaphor. Furthermore, we found that the essence of conceptual metaphor was similar to the concept of “forms” in Maria Harris’ “education as a formgiving.” Based on this, the thesis confirmed the possibility of Christian education through metaphors and presented an alternative model. This paper will serve as a starting point for us who are confronted with unexpected way of living in the Post-Covid 19 era to present timely Christian metaphors."
Comparison of the Physical Properties and in vivo Bioactivities of Flatwise-Spun Silk Mats and Cocoon-Derived Silk Mats for Guided Bone Regeneration,2020,"['silkworm cocoon', 'silk mat', 'guided bone regeneration', 'flatwise-spun silk.']",,"The main flaw of silkworm cocoon originated membranes for guided bone regeneration (GBR) techniques is that the maximum size of the membrane is determined by the size of the cocoon. Flatwise-spun silk does not have any limitation to its production size. The objective of this study was to compare flatwise-spun silk mats with cocoon-derived silk mats for a GBR technique. Tensile strength, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and sericin contents analysis were done for in vitro test. Bone regeneration ability was tested in the critical sized defect of the animal model. In this study, flatwise-spun silk mats showed lower tensile strength and similar tensile strain to a cocoon-derived commercialized silk mat (TDI). Compared to TDIs, the flatwise-spun silk mats showed a similar second derivative spectrum, but they showed an increased abundance of the random coil and helix structures in the FTIR spectra because of a higher content of sericin. In animal model experiments, the bone volume (BV) after the application of a flatwisespun silk mat was similar to the volume observed after the application of a TDI. Both groups showed a significantly higher BV compared to an unfilled control group (P<0.05). Considering that there was no size limitation in producing flatwise-spun silk mats, their clinical indications could be much wider than cocoon-derived silk mats."
Removal of U(VI) from aqueous solution using carboxymethyl cellulose-modified Ca-rectorite hybrid composites,2020,"['Ca-REC Hybrid Composites', 'Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC)', 'U(VI)', 'Adsorption Mechanism']",,"Uranium (VI), as a toxic contaminant, is a potential detriment to human health and environmental safety.In this experiment, carboxymethyl cellulose/Ca-rectorite composite material (Ca-REC/CMC) was prepared by crosslinking reaction to remove U(VI) from the liquid. The crystal structure was detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and surface structure and morphology of the materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface functional groups of prepared materials were detected by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The adsorption capacity of Ca-REC/CMC improved obviously after being modified by CMC. The adsorption capacity of Ca-REC/CMC was closely related to ionic strength and pH. According to thermodynamic parameter calculation, the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. Adsorption isotherms could be depicted perfectly by the Langmuir model. Ca-REC/CMC maintained stability and regeneration after recycling six times. The adsorption mechanism, including electrostatic interactions and ionic interaction, was investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

Adsorption study was performed for the removal of CHD on fly ash (FA) as a function of pH and ionic strength. Experimental result has been validated by characterization using Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller. CHD adsorption with FA showed an increasing trend with an increase in pH. Variation in pH proved to be an influential parameter for the surface charge of adsorbent and the degree of ionization of the CHD molecules. The adsorption capacity of CHD decreased from 23.60 mg g-1 to 1.13 mg g-1, when ionic strength increased from to M. The adsorption isotherms were simulated well by the Freundlich isotherm model having R2 = 0.98.

Specifically, this study diagnoses the concept of fake news as a “network of meaning”, created by the interests of political, social and technological actors. We will examine the intertwined relations which surround the concept of fake news, between legacy news media and digital news platforms, professional journalists and civil media, elite politicians and conservative populist political organizations. To this end, the study first reviews the discussions on the conceptualization process of fake news, followed by American ‘fake news typology model’ emerged in the phase of the 2016 US presidential campaign. Second, it examines the discourses of legacy news media which focus on the negative effects of fake news on democracy. And third, we look at the emergence of critical discourses that pursue the responsibility of social media platforms for the rapid spread of fake news, and the counterdiscourses of technology companies. So, this study emphasizes the need to pay more attention to the concept of fake news and the more specific political reality in which it operates through the process of confornting among multiple networks of meaning. In addition, by examining the discourse hierarchies inherent in the meanings, it is pointed out that this is a new step in the interaction between journalism and technology and an important touchstone that shows the scene of power shift in the field."

1950년대 중국의 파블로프 학설 수용과 의료 체계의 변화: 보호성(保護性) 의료 제도의 확립을 중심으로,2020,"['Pavlov', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Neuropathology', 'Sleep therapy', 'PPM(Psychoprophylactic method of painless childbirth)', 'Protective medical system', '파블로프', '조건반사', '신경병리학설', '수면요법', '무통분만', '보호성 의료제도']","1950년대 스탈린은 파블로프의 이론을 사회주의 의학 이론으로 공식화하여, 부르주아 과학 및 이데올로기를 비판하고 스탈린 체제를 공고화하는 데 적극 활용하였다. 스탈린은 인간과 환경의 상호작용 및 획득형질의 유전을 강조하는 파블로프 학설을 활용하여, 정치와 사회 전반에 걸친 사회주의 체제 개혁의 정당성을 확보하고자 하였다. 또한 스탈린은 인민의 교육과 교화를 통해 자신과 국가에 대한 맹목적 충성 및 애국심으로 무장한 ‘사회주의적 인간형’을 만들어 냄으로써, 자본주의 체제에 대항하는 소련식 공산주의를 창출하고자 하였다. 그 결과 파블로프는 생리학과 의학 이론의 창시자로 신격화되었으며, 그의 학설은 과학계를 비롯한 학문 전반을 통제하는 이데올로기로 자리매김 하였다. 이후 소련의 과학자들과 의료인들은 파블로프의 이론에 부합되지 않은 연구 활동에 대해서 엄격한 통제와 검열을 당했으며, 자유롭고 창의적인 연구를 진행하는 것이 불가능할 정도였다. 이러한 교조주의적 경향은 소련식 사회주의 모델을 수용한 북한과 중국에서도 유사하게 나타났다.특히 중국에서는 1950년 ‘중소우소동맹호조조약(中蘇友好同盟互助條約)’을 체결하고, 소련식 모델에 근간을 사회주의 체제를 건설하기 위해 정치ㆍ경제ㆍ사회ㆍ교육ㆍ법률ㆍ과학ㆍ의료 전반에 걸친 소련 학습 운동을 전개하였다. 중국의 의료계에서는 ‘파블로프 학습 운동’을 통해 의료계의 부르주아적 잔재를 재거하기 위한 사상 투쟁이 광범위하게 일어났으며, 소련식 보건 의료 체계와 의료 기술을 무비판적 받아들였다. 이를 통해서 피르호(Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow)의 세포병리학설과 멘델(Gregor Johann Mendel)의 유전학이 유심주의적ㆍ부르주아적인 것으로 치부되어 배척당하고, 이를 대신하여 파블로프의 학설이 변증법적 유물론에 토대를 둔 사회주의적 의학 이론으로 공식화되었다. 그 결과 파블로프의 학설은 의학 및 과학 지식 체계를 재편하고, 사회주의적 의료 시스템을 확립하는데 중요한 사상적 도구로 활용되었다.  1950년대 중국의 의료인들은 파블로프 학습운동을 통해 사회주의 사상 교육을 강화하고, 업무 태도를 개선하는 한편 수면요법과 무통분만법과 같은 새로운 치료법을 활용하였다. 무엇보다 보호성 의료 제도를 실천하여 새로운 사회주의적 의료 체계를 확립하고자 하였다. 보호성 의료 제도는 환자의 치료에 부정적 자극을 미치는 요소들을 제거하고, 환자 중심의 의료 체계를 구축하는 것을 목표로 하였다. 이를 위해 병원에서는 위생적 환경의 조성, 각종 소음의 제거, 친절한 업무 태도의 양성, 음식 영양의 개선 등 방면에서 구체적인 노력을 전개하였다. 그 결과 병원의 임상 관리ㆍ환경 미화ㆍ업무 태도가 전반적으로 개선되었고, 질병의 치료율도 향상되었다. 그러나 한편으로 병원 내에서 환자에 대한 위생교육이나 사상교육이 강화되면서, 병원은 사회주의적 규율과 이데올로기를 주입하는 장소로 변모하였다. 요컨대 병원이 사회주의적 국민을 양성하는 정치적 장소로 변질되어가는 경향이 존재했다. 중국의 파블로프 학습운동과 보호성 의료 제도의 실시는 1950년대 후반 소련과의 관계가 악화되면서 그 열기를 점차 잃어갔다. 소련에서 파블로프 학설은 스탈린 독제 체제의 구축을 위해 정치적으로 이용되었는데, 이런 이유에서 스탈린 체제가 붕괴되자 파블로프 학설에 대한  ...","In the 1930s, Stalin established Pavlovian theory as a socialist medical theory, criticized bourgeois science and ideology, and consolidated his dictatorship. Stalin used Pavlov's theory to emphasize the interaction between man and environment and the inheritance of acquired characteristics, trying to ensure the legitimacy of the socialist system reform in politics and society. Therefore, if the Soviet scientists and doctors did not conform to Pavlov's theory, their research would be strictly controlled, making free and creative research impossible. In the 1950s, China and North Korea, which accepted the socialist political model of the Soviet Union, also had this dogmatic tendency.In 1950, China signed the “The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship,” initiated the movement of learning from the Soviet Union in politics, economy, society, education, law, science, medical care, and other aspects, and established a socialist country based on the Soviet model. In Chinese medical circles, through the “Pavlov Learning Movement,"" they accepted the health care system and medical technology of the Soviet Union without any criticism, and carried out the ideological transformation of intellectuals to wipe out the influence of western capitalism. Moreover, Virchow's ‘Cellular Pathology’ and Mendel's ‘Genetics’ were denounced as reactionary bourgeoisie theory, and Pavlov's theory became a socialist medical theory based on dialectical materialism. As a result, the Communist Party of China reorganized the medical and scientific knowledge system based on Pavlov's theory, and took it as an important ideological tool to establish the socialist medical system.In the 1950s, Chinese medical workers strengthened ideological education through the “Pavlov's learning movement,” applied this theory to clinical practice, and implemented new treatment methods such as “Sleep Therapy” and “PPM(Psychoprophylactic Painless childbirth Method).” In addition, hospitals implemented the “Protective Medical System” and established the socialist medical system. The goal of the protective medical system was to eliminate the negative stimulation which has adverse effects on the treatment of patients and to establish a patient-centered medical system. Therefore, the hospital launched a comprehensive effort to create a clean environment, eliminate all kinds of noise, cultivate a friendly working attitude, and improve nutrition. As a result, the hospital environment and the working attitude of medical staff improved and the treatment rate of diseases also improved, while the mortality rate of patients decreased.At the same time, with the strengthening of political education for doctors, nurses and patients in hospitals, hospitals have become places to educate socialist laws and ideology. In addition, in order to prove the superiority of Pavlov's theory, medical workers carried out unscientific sleep therapy on patients, so people's body became an experimental space for of socialism. Moreover, in the implementation of PPM, women could not tell the pain of childbirth, but under medical control, they were in a contradictory situation of enduring labor pain. The Communist Party of China has established its national identity by promoting its image of “rescuer”, which liberates the patients from the pain of disease, and the “welfare” image of taking good care of the people's body. The Communist Party of China has reconstructed the metaphors of “sickness” and “labor pain”, making it an indispensable medium for the concepts of socialism, women's Liberation and medical welfare to be engraved on the people's body. Therefore, through the clinical practice of sleep therapy and PPM, we can understand how the Communist Party of China controlled the people's body, and such policies and systems demonstrate the “medical” governance mode of socialist control over the people."

The major factor influencing the contact force is tread wear, and the more tire tread wears out, the higher risk of losing control of a vehicle exits. The tire tread condition is generally checked by visual inspection that can be easily forgotten. In this paper, we propose the intelligent tire (iTire) system that consists of an acceleration sensor, a wireless signal transmission unit and a tread classifier. In addition, we also presents classification algorithm that transforms the acceleration signal into the frequency domain and extracts the features of several frequency bands as inputs to an artificial neural network. The artificial neural network for classifying tire wear was designed with an Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. Experiments showed that tread wear classification accuracy was over 80%."

Ferrofluids are made out of nanoscale ferromagnetic materials suspended in a base fluid (oil, kerosene, water). The distinction between the magnetorheological fluids (MRF) and ferrofluids (FF) is the size of the materials. The materials in a ferrofluid fundamentally comprise of nanomaterials, which are suspended by Brownian diffusion and generally under normal conditions will not settle. Here, Ferrosoferric Oxide (Fe₃O₄) is considered as nanoparticle and water as a base fluid. The governing equations are modeled by using Tiwari-Das nanofluid model with the help of appropriate similarity transformations. Furthermore, radiative heat flux and convective boundary condition is accounted. The numerical results of the governing equations are obtained through implementation of Built-in-Shooting technique. The impact of radiation parameter, stretching ratio parameter, magnetic parameter, thermal Biot number, micro-rotation parameter, velocity slip parameter and Darcy-Forchheimer number on the flow velocity and temperature are revealed graphically and discussed. The engineering curiosity like skin friction and Nusselt number are computationally computed and tabulated."

Delamination behavior of L-shaped composite beam with manufacturing defects,2020,['· Composite L-shaped beam · Delamination · Manufacturing defects · Pre-crack · Wavy ply'],,"Composite structures are more susceptible to manufacturing defects than conventional materials. Fiber misalignment, cracks, and voids are typical types of manufacturing defects in laminated composites. Defects can greatly reduce structural integrity and load carrying capacity, so their effects on material and structural strengths must be understood. In this paper, the effect of manufacturing defects on the progressive delamination behavior was studied for carbon/epoxy composite laminated L-beam under four-point bending test conditions. The defects of wavy plies and pure resin that had flowed out were characterized from surface photography and then transformed into finite element modeling using semi-automatic approach to which pre-delamination and void were included. Next, progressive failure analyses were performed with the interface delamination and matrix direction failure accounted for by cohesive zone modeling. Numerical results were examined focusing on the effects of defects on the peak load reduction and the variation of delamination pattern. The stacking sequence effect was also investigated."
Progressive effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on 16 Phenotypic Traits based on Longitudinal Data,2020,['Heritability\xa0· Phenotypic trait\xa0· Genomic restricted maximum likelihood\xa0· Longitudinal changes'],,"Background There are many research studies have estimated the heritability of phenotypic traits, but few have considered longitudinal changes in several phenotypic traits together. Objective To evaluate the progressive effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on prominent health-related phenotypic traits by determining SNP-based heritability ( h2snp ) using longitudinal data. Methods Sixteen phenotypic traits associated with major health indices were observed biennially for 6843 individuals with 10-year follow-up in a Korean community-based cohort. Average SNP heritability and longitudinal changes in the total period were estimated using a two-stage model. Average and periodic differences for each subject were considered responses to estimate SNP heritability. Furthermore, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed for significant SNPs. Results Each SNP heritability for the phenotypic mean of all sixteen traits through 6 periods (baseline and five follow-ups) were significant. Gradually, the forced vital capacity in one second (FEV1) reflected the only significant SNP heritability among longitudinal changes at a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted 0.05 significance level ( h2snp = 0.171, FDR = 0.0012). On estimating chromosomal heritability, chromosome 2 displayed the highest heritability upon periodic changes in FEV1. SNPs including rs2272402 and rs7209788 displayed a genome-wide significant association with longitudinal changes in FEV1 (P = 1.22 × 10−8 for rs2272402 and P = 3.36 × 10−7 for rs7209788). De novo variants including rs4922117 (near LPL, P = 2.13 ×  10−15) of log-transformed high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratios and rs2335418 (near HMGCR , P = 3.2 ×  10−9) of low-density lipoprotein were detected on GWAS. Conclusion Significant genetic effects on longitudinal changes in FEV1 among the middle-aged general population and chromosome 2 account for most of the genetic variance."

To this end, we are pursuing collaboration with customers and challenging innovation in financial business from a global perspective with various partners.The combination of finance and IT did not start now, and until now, many domestic financial institutions have provided consistent system integration from hardware, information systems, and various solutions that are the basis for customers. These days, with the emergence of FinTech-related companies that provide new financial services utilizing digital technologies such as smartphones and IoT (Internet of Things), the competitive environment in the financial field has changed significantly, and existing financial institutions are also moving toward transformation. It is understood that the movement is becoming active. I think it is important to develop and deliver Individual financial business operators are required to create new values ​​with more open innovation oriented than ever before, such as partnerships with FinTech-related companies or hiring OSS (Open Source Software). In the midst of these changes, it is necessary to understand the trend of digital technology and the trend of FinTech and respond with the goal of collaboration between customers and innovative solutions.FinTech is a move to redefine financial services from a user's point of view by utilizing non-financially developed data utilization technology and open infrastructure. Currently, the expansion of personal financial services is the mainstream, but it will also lead to the provision of financial services to the unbanked overseas. Our social innovation should introduce a policy that is the center of creativity to create innovative solutions with customers by sharing customer challenges.As for IoT, there are already models of preventive maintenance and fleet management systems for industrial devices and vehicles. By using it, you will be able to create personal property-backed loans, new types of insurance products, and financial services that have never been before. AI acts on behalf of people, not only contributing to the efficiency of financial affairs, but also having the possibility to discover new facts or laws related to finance from a variety of data, so it is necessary to find a variety of applications. However, in the realization of innovation, new technology is not essential, but rather an idea or framework that combines existing technologies well. To do this, it is necessary to actively work on discovering solutions with customers while utilizing the IoT platform. In addition, cooperation with innovations in other fields such as energy, transportation, and healthcare is required, so cooperation with researchers such as big data analysis or IoT is necessary, and in the end, it is necessary to spur the creation of new ideas that transcend financial boundaries. Through such activities, it is necessary to lead innovation in the financial field by forming a new ecosystem for financial innovation."

From Invisible Beneficiaries to Independent Rights Holders: How the Disability Rights Movement Changed Korea’s Law and Society,2020,"['disability', 'independent rights holder', 'discrimination', 'inclusive society', 'right to mobility']",,"Like most other societies, Korean society has long viewed disability as a medical problem or a personal tragedy. People with disabilities were considered objects of medical treatment, charity, and social welfare. Society and its legal system thus treated people with disabilities in paternalistic ways rather than as rights bearers. However, some persons with disabilities and their supporters began to raise their voices to protest such mistreatment and discrimination. They claimed that people with disabilities should be regarded not as objects but as subjects or rights holders. The long process of struggling for equal treatment for persons with disabilities finally resulted in changes in government policies and legislation, including the enactment of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) in 2007. The DDA is not just a new law; it is a comprehensive law that represents a significant paradigm shift in disability rights and associated discourses. The new social and human rights models of disabilities have replaced the charity and medical models. The enactment of the Transportation Convenience Act in 2005 was also an essential step toward creating a more inclusive and integrated society. People with disabilities publicly asserted their right to mobility: They should not have to remain inside homes or institutions. Correspondingly, this article charts how waves of activism and legal reform in Korea transformed societal and governmental perceptions of disability to recognize and protect the rights of persons with disabilities increasingly. Intertwined struggles by disabilities groups, civic organizations, and lawyers raised the public awareness of disability rights. They pushed the National Assembly to enact or amend laws that significantly affected the lives of people with disabilities in South Korea."

From 2013 to 2020, 392 papers, which were judged as quantitative research from doctoral and master thesis, and academic journals published in Korea were selected as research subjects. 28 duplicates of thesis and thesis are excluded. A total of 52 papers were finally selected, excluding 312 papers that were insufficient to be used as research data because there were no statistical values such as correlation coefficients. For the 52 selected papers, the homogeneity of the variables was first verified. As a result of the homogeneity test, the innovativeness, risk-taking, initiative, and entrepreneurship education all showed great effects on heterogeneity, and the average effect size was analyzed by random effect model. The average effect size analyzed was 0.38 ~ 0.49, and all four variables showed moderate average effect size. As a result of analyzing the average effect size by forest plot, all showed proper results. From the results of funnel plot analysis of entrepreneurship education, published errors were confirmed asymmetric. Research data on entrepreneurship education shows that it cannot represent the whole. It is a structural equation model with entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention as a parameter. Iinnovation and risk-taking have an impact on entrepreneurship by taking entrepreneurship education as a parameter. Initiative had an effect on the entrepreneurial intention a business, regardless of entrepreneurship education. In a number of studies, university entrepreneurship education has had an impact on the entrepreneurial intention. It should be changed to entrepreneurship education that combines theory and practice. Entrepreneurship education should be transformed into continuous and field-oriented education."

First, I introduce holistic models of knowledge and constructivism in education. Second, I suggest ‘linguistic turn’ as another noticeable phenomenon. Language is an element of culture, but a priviledged one because culture, in itself, is linguistic. So culture is a sort of a text. We can see that liberal arts or humanities to deal with texts, contexts and languages can have an important role to read, understand and construct a world. So the rediscovery of the traditional model of the education of liberal arts like processes of graduating studies of liberal arts or humanities, is relevant to a new ‘practical’ model of reading and leading recent social transformations. An important point is academic contribution. And current situation called ‘Knowledge-Based Society’ also supports my point in another way. The situation of rapidly changing knowledge requires an education of problem-solving ability by unifying and reconstructing knowledge supporting with constructivism in education rather than the cramming system of education."
Serum vitamin D levels and ovarian reserve markers in secondary amenorrhea patients: Is there a link?,2020,"['Anti-Mullerian hormone', 'Amenorrhea', 'Ovarian reserve', '25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Polycystic ovarian syndrome']",,"ObjectiveTo investigate whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level is associated with ovarian reserve markers in secondary amenorrhea (SA) patients.MethodsSixty-three women diagnosed with SA were recruited during 12 months from the initiation of this prospective observational study. Serum 25(OH)D levels, serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels and antral follicle count (AFC) were estimated in study participants and ovarian reserve markers were compared between participants with vitamin D deficiency and those with normal vitamin D levels.ResultsOf the 63 participants, 27 (42.9%) were vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL) and 36 (57.1%) had normal vitamin D levels. The mean AMH levels and AFC were 10.86±8.94 μ/L and 15.23±7.65 in the vitamin D deficient group, and 7.24±5.62 μ/L and 12.30±6.95 in the normal vitamin D group. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis of log10 transformed AMH and AFC with serum 25(OH)D adjusted for age and body mass index confirmed no association between vitamin D levels and AMH levels or AFC. There was also no correlation between serum 25(OH)D and AMH levels or AFC in all participants. However, participants with vitamin D deficiency had an increased chance of having polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) as cause of SA than those with normal vitamin D levels (adjusted odds ratio, 7.559; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-44.65; P=0.026) after adjustment for clinical factors by logistic regression model.ConclusionThere was no correlation between serum 25(OH)D levels and ovarian reserve markers in SA patients, but vitamin D deficiency may be linked to PCOS patients."

Among the eight reform alternatives derived based on the status of depopulation county, town, and township, three alternatives are suggested on a comprehensive review of feasibility and effectiveness.First, the “self-governing town and township” type is to convert the depopulation county into an administrative agency and appoint a head of a local government (i.e., governor) from the upper government. This type has great significance in implementing resident autonomy by forming neighborhood town and township government by the residents and reviving self-governing town and township, which was introduced in the early days of local government.Second, the “institutional integration” type is to transform the institutional form of depopulation county from institutional separation to institutional integration. In this type, town and township do not form a local council but reorganize them into a quasi-local government where the head of a local government is elected by the residents. This type is considered to be the most feasible in that it complements the self-governing town and township while maintaining the status of the depopulation county as the current local government.Third, the “coalition government of town and township” type is to implement self-governing town and township while the depopulation county is constructed in the form of the coalition government of town and township (special-purpose local government). This type is considered as the most innovative autonomous model.The finding of this study is meaningful in that we present an autonomous model that conforms to local characteristics by introducing various autonomous classes (e.g., single-tier system and three-tier system) as well as diversifying the organization of local government through the reform of local government structure."

TV 프로그램 「河殤」은 사회적으로 커다란 반향을 불러일으켰고, 대학가에서는 팡리즈 등을 중심으로 하는 지식인들의 강연이 ‘쌀롱’문화로 나타났다. 이러한 영향으로 대학가에서 민주와 자유의 그리고 개혁에 대한 요구가 확산되었고, 갑작스런 후야오방의 죽음으로 그들의 관심이 폭발한 것이 천안문사건이라고 할 수 있다. 중공당이 지식인들을 탄압하거나 억압한 것은 지식인들의 독립화를 저지하기 위한 것이라기 보다는 지식인들이 주도적으로 정치사회적 변화를 이끄는 것을 허용하지 않은 것이라고 보아야 할 것이다.","intellectuals and the authorities of Communist Party (CCP) from the Cultural Revolution until the 1989 Tiananmen Incident and how it affected the Tiananmen Incident. Deng Xiaoping took power from the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1978. In his pursuit of power, Deng Xiaoping wanted to move out of the shadow of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution, and in order to secure its logical basis and legitimacy he had to seek the support of intellectuals.The Deng Xiaoping regime, however, only provided limited space for the intellectuals and never granted them complete freedom. The intellectuals thought that they should hold initiative for social and political reform and be a role model for the entire society. This idea was reinforced by the “culture fever” that gripped the nation in the mid to late 1980s. The TV program “River Elegy” had a great social impact, and on campus a series of lectures prepared by the intellectuals such as Fang Lizhi developed into so called “salon culture.” With this “culture fever” the demand for democracy, liberty, and reform gradually spread on campus, and the Tiananmen Square protests were only an explosion of such demands.During this period, the CCP authorities oppressed the intellectuals three times in the name of a “campaign against spiritual pollution,” while the later sought to remove the restraint of the Deng Xiaoping regime, which intensified the tension between them. However, such repression was not to deter the independence of intellectuals. Rather it should be understood as the denial of their initiative for social and political transformation."

The main results are as follows. First, the direct effect of attachment anxiety on psychological well-being, pain endurance, and active coping and the direct effect of attachment avoidance on psychological well-being and active coping were found to be negatively significant. Additionally, the path from pain endurance to psychological well-being and the path from active coping to psychological well-being were found to be positively significant. Second, pain endurance and active coping correspondingly, mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and psychological well-being. Third, the mediating effect of active coping was found to be significant in the relationship between attachment avoidance and psychological well-being. The results of this study are significant in that they confirmed the importance of the growth-oriented intervention of pain endurance and active coping to improve the psychological well-being of middle-aged women with unstable adult attachment. In addition, this study suggested the need for differentiated counseling intervention considering two attachment dimension characteristics to transform attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance through active coping to psychological well-being."

Because the large scale of the disaster, such as typhoon, drought, and flood, can affect many rice yields. The optimal copula function for a spatial dependence of rice yields in Korean peninsula has not been studied. The yearly rice production data was collected between 1965 and 2018 by Statistics Korea. The trend of rice production has been eliminated by a piecewise linear model. The marginal distribution of residuals were estimated by maximum likelihood estimation. A pseudo data was generated by inverse transformation method for Elliptical copula, archimedean copula, and extreme copula family. The parametric bootstrap goodness of fit test and cross-validation were performed to find the best copula. As a result, we found that rice production in most provinces has a strong correlation with each other.

With the aim of securing discrimination in the research of cultural contents studies, it attempt to establish a research methodology based on the characteristics and values of cultural contents. Among the various characteristics of cultural content, it focused on the three values of experience (significance, interest, aesthetic), conceptualized each element and reconsidered the possibility as a study methodology. First of all, the significance element is formed in relation to the creator and the story, which is the intention of the content to occur and the meaning contained in it. In addition, it is contemporary characteristic because it is interpreted by the enjoyment of the present period and can be transformed according to the times. The interest element is built in the stage of contentization, through the constructiveness of creators, storytelling and expression forms. The aesthetic element is an emotional dimension that expresses emotional ringing and expansion of thinking through beauty, which is defined as a sensuous image within the contents. The factors that make up each element of the above triple structure are synthesized and schematized into a single model. The triple structure of cultural contents experience is the value generated by enjoying cultural contents, and at the same time, it is returned as an elements that constitutes the internal structure of cultural contents. Therefore, it is possible to analyze the internal structure of a specific cultural contents through a triple structure model of cultural contents and to use it as a means of creation or criticism. This becomes a methodology of cultural contents analysis and creation that penetrates the domain of theory and practice. If the method of studying cultural contents by paying attention to the unique characteristics of cultural contents is accumulated, it is expected that the academic identity of cultural contents alone will be solidified."

Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) theory of leadership is rooted in the premise of differential quality of relationships between leaders and members. LMX theory was identified in the literature nearly 40 years ago and has received considerable research attention in the field of management research. A number of comprehensive review studies have been conducted on the results of the accumulated LMX studies overseas. Although LMX research was started in Korea in the 1980s, however, there has been insufficient effort to critically review the accumulated studies on LMX and to explore agendas for future research.  The present study aims to summarize research trends and to suggest future directions for LMX research. This paper presents the overview of LMX studies by reviewing 64 papers published in 6 academic journals in the field of management over the last 10 years in Korea. A systematic literature review process proposed by Transfield et al.(2003) was applied to the analysis of research trends. The major findings and suggestions are as follows.  First, research on LMX theory began in the 1980s in Korea, and it is still being dealt with as a major research topic in the field of organizational behavior and leadership. However, most LMX studies are empirical and relatively few researches are on theory and concept. Therefore, it is necessary to expand conceptual study for the balanced development of LMX research. In addition, efforts should be made to broaden the horizon of LMX theory through linkage and integration with other leadership theories, which can be helpful in sharing basic principles with LMX theory, such as transformation leadership or servant leadership.  Second, most LMX studies so far have collected data from participants at a certain time. However, due to the nature of the cross-sectional study, the effect of the time variable inherent in the LMX development and changing process could not be reflected in those researches. Therefore, it is necessary to expand a research design for longitudinal study on LMX in the future.  Third, LMX measurements have been made by questionnaire only to members except leaders in almost all LMX studies. Thus, the relational characteristics of LMX, which must be considered together with the leader, have not been sufficiently reflected on LMX studies. Thus, future studies should also collect data from leaders when measuring LMX. In addition, qualitative content analysis should be used to supplement the limitations of data collection through self-reporting questionnaires.  Finally, although LMX was used primarily as an independent variable or a mediator in the past, LMX has recently been treated as a dependent variable or a moderator. However, in many cases, the rationale for the relationship between LMX and other variables was not clearly presented in the hypothesis setting. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a rationale for developing hypotheses with LMX in the research model. This study may also contribute to serving a guide to the theoretical development and future research of the subject for leadership researchers."

In order to solve social problems, it is necessary to employ post-modern education planning, and to do so the author of the present study attempted to find the answers from the lifelong learning model as a type of transformative learning grounded on the Analects of Confucius.  First, a wide range of social and educational issues such as failing to build the right society, widespread reason-oriented thinking, not taking a pause when necessary, and considering human beings as instruments brought about serious problems in education.  Second, as an ideological alternative to alleviate those social and educational problems the author explored the wisdom embedded in the Confucian perspectives on human beings and his remarks on education. What is important is to become a virtuous human by practicing benevolence based on love. To do so, it is necessary to overcome personal desires and put yourself in someone else""s shoes based on Confucius loyalty and reciprocity in everyday life. It is also important to enjoy learning with constant curiosity and perseverance.  Third, as an educational model in the post-modern society the goal of learning should be perceived as building a true self through a lifelong learning process instead of completing education at a certain time in life. The Confucian lifelong learning model emphasizes learning beyond the school and continuing education throughout one""s life, which could alleviate a lot of present problems in education and further help make a person more mature. These accumulated learning experiences will help get rid of narrow-mindedness, self-centeredness, and stereotypes, and help people gain insights to see things from a new perspective. Confucius exemplified practicing benevolence in his lifetime, reflecting on himself grounded on love of learning, which can be considered as a lifelong learning model as a type of transformative learning in this post-modern era."
텍스트 감정분석을 이용한 IT 서비스 품질요소 분석,2020,"['Text Sentiment Analysis', 'Kano Model', 'Quality Element Classification']",,"In order to satisfy customers, it is important to identify the quality elements that affect customers’ satisfaction. The Kano model has been widely used in identifying multi-dimensional quality attributes in this purpose. However, the model suffers from various shortcomings and limitations, especially those related to survey practices such as the data amount, reply attitude and cost. In this research, a model based on the text sentiment analysis is proposed, which aims to substitute the survey-based data gathering process of Kano models with sentiment analysis. In this model, from the set of opinion text, quality elements for the research are extracted using the morpheme analysis. The opinions’ polarity attributes are evaluated using text sentiment analysis, and those polarity text items are transformed into equivalent Kano survey questions. Replies for the transformed survey questions are generated based on the total score of the original data. Then, the question-reply set is analyzed using both the original Kano evaluation method and the satisfaction index method. The proposed research model has been tested using a large amount of data of public IT service project evaluations. The result shows that it can replace the existing practice and it promises advantages in terms of quality and cost of data gathering. The authors hope that the proposed model of this research may serve as a new quality analysis model for a wide range of areas."

As the residential neighborhood for middle class is the space that organizes their daily lives specifically, its components or arrangements are Habitus conditions for their class reproduction. The ‘neighborhood unit’ model, which was quoted from the land readjustment projects for middle class residence by Japanese colonial authority, has been transformed and institutionalized into the legalistic design standard for housing plan through iterative projects of complex-type apartment construction triggered by the large-scale housing supply policy. Starting with Gangnam, as apartments, apartment complexes, and newtown developments turned into the mainstream of Korean middle class residence, the public model of neighborhood unit, which used to believe in the public education within walkable vicinity and common sphere of community living, was deformed into a stratum model that selectively organizes public and shadow education. Increasing dependence on shadow education and frequent reconstruction of aging apartment complexes by private companies bolster the classist neighborhood planning model with internalized facilities for shadow education and elite enclave only for the dwellers. As this transformation illuminates the significance of the neighborhood as Habitus, one can predict that the upcoming regeneration of middle class residence in Korea lies in line with the class reproduction condition."
Performance evaluation of composite moment-frame structures with seismic damage mitigation systems using wavelet analyses,2020,"['composite frame', 'wavelet', 'dynamic analysis', 'seismic']",,"This study aims at evaluating composite moment frame structures (CFS) using wavelet analysis of the displacement behavior of these structures. Five seismic damage mitigation systems’ models of 9-story CFS are examined namely, basic (Model 1), reinforced (Model 2), buckling restrained braced (BRB) (Model 3), lead rubber bearing (LRB) (Model 4), and composite (Model 5) moment frames. A novel integration between continuous and discrete wavelet transforms is designed to estimate the wavelet power energy and variance of measurements’ behaviors. The behaviors of the designed models are evaluated under influence of four seismic loads to study the dynamic performance of CFS in the frequency domain. The results show the behaviors of models 3 and 5 are lower than other models in terms of displacement and frequency performances. Model 3 has been shown lower performances in terms of energy and variance wavelets along the monitoring time; therefore, Model 3 demonstrates superior performance and low probability of failure under seismic loads. Furthermore, the wavelet variance analysis is shown a powerful tool that can be used to assess the CFS under seismic hazards."

Based on four optimizaton models of profit maximization, cost minimization, utility maximization, and expenditure minimization, in the static model, the dualities of each model are found and categorized into three types; [Type I] is the dual relationship between the value function and the choice variables in the primal model, [Type II] is the dual relationship between the value function and the transformation function, and [Type III] is the dual relationship between the objective function and the constraint function. In particular, [Type II] exchanges maximization problem (choice variables) as a primal model with minimization (state variables) as a dual model and vice and versa. In Type III, a maximization problem in the primal model becomes a minimization problem in the dual model and the value function in the primal are set to the state variables in the dual and vice and versa. This relationship was used to derive dual identities and the Slutsky equation. In the dynamic optimization model with adjustment costs, the dual relationship can be revealed between the dynamic profit function maximization problem and the profit gap minimization problem and between the value function and the production function. Applying the functional form of the modified generalized Leontief function to the value function, we can suggest a subtantive and practical process to derive the dynamic factor demand model that maximizes dynamic profits."

The results indicated that transformational leadership was positively related to both work engagement and job performance. Utilization ability for computational system was also positively related to the two outcome variables. Authors then examined the moderating effect of utilization ability for computational system among transformational leadership, work engagement, and job performance. The two interaction terms had the positive impacts on the two outcome variables of the employees. In other words, the positive relationships among transformational leadership, work engagement, and job performance were stronger when the perception of employees for their own utilization ability for computational system was higher. The findings suggest comprehensive implication in information technology and leadership research field by emphasizing the importance of utilization ability for computational system in organizations."

According to the results, transformational leadership consisted of three factors (charisma, consideration, and intellectual stimulation). In model I of regression analysis, where three factors were applied, all factors showed a statistically significant relationship with job engagement. However, in model II of regression, where self-efficacy was applied, only self-efficacy and consideration showed positive associations with job engagement. Therefore, it is necessary for beauty management to induce the engagement of employees' job by cultivating transformative leadership based on consideration in the state of having self-efficacy."
A novel analytical approach for advection diffusion equation for radionuclide release from an area source,2020,"['The laplace transform method', 'Three-dimensional steady state advection diffusion equation', 'The airborne radionuclide release', 'The hypergeometric function and the eddy diffusivity coefficients']",,The method of the Laplace transform has been used to obtain an analytical solution of the three-dimensional steady state advection diffusion equation for the airborne radionuclide release from any nuclear installation such as the power reactor in an area source. The present treatment takes into account the removal of the pollutants through the nuclear reaction. We assume that the pollutants are emitted as a constant rate from the area source. This physical consideration is achieved by assuming that the vertical eddy diffusivity coefficient should be a constant. The prevailing wind speed is a constant in 𝑥- direction and a linear function of the vertical height z. The present model calculations are compared with the other models and the available data of the atmospheric dispersion experiments that were carried out in the nuclear power plant of Angra dos Reis (Brazil). The results show that the present treatment performs well as the analytical dispersion model and there is a good agreement between the values computed by our model and the observed data.

After Russo-Japanese War, Tanaka emphasized whether each nation had supported their own army or not decided the victory and defeat, and urged cooperation between army and nation to prepare for greater war in the future. Particularly, he focused on veterans as bridges between army and nation and asked them to be model citizens. And he regarded Germany as a model of his doctrine. After returning from a tour of inspection of European countries and United States, Tanaka proposed his doctrine more aggressively. He appealed directly to the nation by vigorous speeches and writings. And he made contact surface between army and nation much broader by appealing to youth, untrained reservists and female. Moreover, he secured understanding and support to his doctrine from Japanese Imperial Household. As the First World War had started and became total war, he felt the necessity of cooperation between army and nation more seriously. However, rice riots(Kome Sodo) and the revolution and defeat of Germany fundamentally shook the relationship which Tanaka had built. The riots arose at the time which cooperation between army and nation is most required, that is, in wartime. Many of veterans and youths, who had been expected to be model citizens, participated in the riots, and even collisions between army and them occurred in some places. And Germany, the model of his doctrine, lost the war by revolution like Russia. In these crisis, he became war minister and placed a high priority on restoration of relationship between army and nation, in cooperation with Hara Takashi s party cabinet."

"THE VALUATION OF VARIANCE SWAPS UNDER STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY, STOCHASTIC INTEREST RATE AND FULL CORRELATION STRUCTURE",2020,"['Heston-CIR hybrid model', 'realized variance', 'stochastic interest rate', 'stochastic volatility', 'variance swap', 'generalized Fourier transform']",,"This paper considers the case of pricing discretely-sampled variance swaps under the class of equity-interest rate hybridization. Our modeling framework consists of the equity which follows the dynamics of the Heston stochastic volatility model, and the stochastic interest rate is driven by the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process with full correlation structure imposed among the state variables. This full correlation structure possesses the limitation to have fully analytical pricing formula for hybrid models of variance swaps, due to the non-affinity property embedded in the model itself. We address this issue by obtaining an efficient semi-closed form pricing formula of variance swaps for an approximation of the hybrid model via the derivation of characteristic functions. Subsequently, we implement numerical experiments to evaluate the accuracy of our pricing formula. Our findings confirm that the impact of the correlation between the underlying and the interest rate is significant for pricing discretely-sampled variance swaps."

Analysis based on frequency domain: through modal analysis and frequency response analysis on the finite element model of track structure, it is found that there are natural frequencies of track structure close to measured corrugation passing frequencies. It shows that the vibration modes corresponding to these frequencies can be more easily excited, which can cause the resonance phenomenon of track structure and form the rail corrugation at corresponding frequencies. Analysis based on time domain: the time-history curves of rail vertical vibration acceleration and rail vertical displacement are calculated by using vehicle-track coupled model and the frequency domain transformation of the time-history data is carried out. It is found that there are characteristic frequencies close to the measured corrugation passing frequencies, which indicates that the vibration of track structure at corresponding frequencies is an important reason to promote the formation of corrugation. The change of vehicle speed has no effect on characteristic frequencies of corrugation growth rate curves, which reflects the fixed frequency characteristic of corrugation. With the increase of train operation times, the corrugation corresponding to characteristic frequencies will gradually form and develop, and the increase of vehicle speed will increase the wavelength range and development speed of rail corrugation."

An analytical model was established with transformational leadership and ethical leadership as predictor variables, job satisfaction as a dependent variable, and psychological empowerment as a mediator. In addition, a moderated mediation model was estimated to verify that there were differences between the public and private sector employees in the four pathways linking two types of leadership to the dependent variable through the mediator. Findings reveal that transformational leadership only has an indirect effect on job satisfaction through psychological empowerment, whereas ethical leadership has both direct and indirect effects on job satisfaction. In addition, moderated mediating effects exist in the transformational leadership-psychological empowerment link, as well as in the ethical leadership-job satisfaction link. Here, public sector employees are more likely than private sector employees to show higher influences in each linkage. Based on the results, we discussed the possibility of co-existence of transformational leadership and ethical leadership and its implications for the public sector."

Specifically, the field of China studies is analyzed as case study to explain the formation of post-Cold War area studies. The historical formation and development of area studies in the post-Cold war period demonstrate two fundamental points. First, the post-Cold war area studies have been directly influenced and shaped by the changes in international relations. Three major changes in international relations acted as the turning points for transforming the characteristics of area studies during the post-Cold war era: the end of the Cold War following the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European Socialist Block; the September 11 terrorist attack and the reconstruction of the US-led unipolar order; and the global financial crisis and the rise of China. Second, the changes in area studies during this period were also simultaneously influenced by discussions in and across academic disciplines, especially social sciences. Examples of such academic discussions include those on the prevailing consensus of the western world after the Cold War, including the ‘end of history’ thesis; the theory of the clash of civilizations and cultures subsequent to the September 11 attack; and the China Model discourse following the global financial crisis. Conclusively, the transformation of area studies’ defining features in the post-Cold war epoch bears a close relation to the establishment and maintenance of the new hegemony as a result of the changes in the international order and discussions in and across academic disciplines."
Accuracy analysis of spatial multi-loop mechanism effected by paired bearings support joint clearance,2020,['· Accuracy analysis · Bearing clearances · Multi-loop mechanism · Spatial revolute joint'],,"The primary objective of this work is to present a three-dimensional (3D) clearance model of the paired bearings support joint (PBS-joint) and address the influence of PBSjoint clearance on the accuracy of the spatial multi-loop mechanism. Through the synthetic use of the vector and homogeneous coordinate transformation methods, the 3D clearance model of the PBS-joint is obtained on the basis of the static balance condition. When clearance is equated as a spatial virtual link, the error space solution models of serial mechanism and single-loop mechanism are developed respectively according to the Denavit-Hartenberg method and the geometric closure condition. The error space standardization solution model of the multi-loop mechanism is then presented through improving the low-layer loop sequence description method of the topological structure relations. Finally, the application in the basic loop mechanism is demonstrated to discuss the procedures adopted in this work and the influence of the PBS-joint clearance. Results show that the PBS-joint clearance may cause the error on the point with a 3D deviation transmission path to deviate the normal distribution. Moreover, the plane-joint clearance model may not yield an accurate analysis of the spatial mechanism."
Double Closed-loop Integral Terminal Sliding Mode for a Class of Underactuated Systems Based on Sliding Mode Observer,2020,"['Observer', 'sliding mode control', 'stability analysis', 'underactuated system.']",,"Aiming to solve the tracking control problem of a class of second-order underactuated mechanical systems with unknown model parts, external disturbances and noise disturbances, a double closed-loop layered integral terminal sliding mode control method based on sliding mode observer is proposed. At the outset, the Lagrange model of the system is transformed into an affine model, and a sliding mode observer is designed according to the system structure. Neatly, the outer loop controller is designed using the observer’s estimated state, and the output value of the outer loop controller is filtered with a low pass filter. Then the inner loop controller is designed by using hierarchical sliding mode control method. On a premise of ensuring tracking performance, the control method can maximally improve convergence speed and reduce chattering even if there are unknown model parts, external interference and noise interference phenomena in the system. This simulation results distinctly display the effectiveness of the control tactics."

Estimating the workability of self-compacting concrete in different mixing conditions based on deep learning,2020,"['deep learning', 'self-compacting concrete', 'workability', 'mixing condition', 'mixer', 'mixing volume', 'slump flow and V-funnel test', 'convolutional neural network', 'recurrent neural network']",,"A method is proposed in this paper to estimate the workability of self-compacting concrete (SCC) in different mixing conditions with different mixers and mixing volumes by recording the mixing process based on deep learning (DL). The SCC mixing videos were transformed into a series of image sequences to fit the DL model to predict the SF and VF values of SCC, with four groups in total and approximately thirty thousand image sequence samples. The workability of three groups SCC whose mixing conditions were learned by the DL model, was estimated. One additionally collected group of the SCC whose mixing condition was not learned, was also predicted. The results indicate that whether the SCC mixing condition is included in the training set and learned by the model, the trained model can estimate SCC with different workability effectively at the same time. Our goal to estimate SCC workability in different mixing conditions is achieved."

Abstractive text summarization involves using pre-generated word embedding information. Low-frequency but salient words such as terminologies are seldom included in dictionaries, that are so called, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problems. OOV deteriorates the performance of the encoder-decoder model in the neural network. To address OOV words in abstractive text summarization, we propose a copy mechanism to facilitate copying new words in the target document and generating summary sentences. Different from previous studies, the proposed approach combines accurately pointing information, selective copy mechanism, embedded by BERT, randomly masking OOV, and converting sentences from morpheme. Additionally, the neural network gate model to estimate the generation probability and the loss function to optimize the entire abstraction model was applied. Experimental results demonstrate that ROUGE-1 (based on word recall) and ROUGE-L (longest used common subsequence) of the proposed encoding-decoding model have been improved at 54.97 and 39.23, respectively."
Poultry farm vehicle movements as risk factors for the 2014/15 highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemics in the Republic of Korea,2020,"['Highly pathogenic avian influenza', 'BRT', 'GLM', 'risk factors', 'Republic of Korea']",,"Since the first HPAI epidemics in 2003, there has been little epidemiological research on the association between HPAI epidemics and vehicle movements around poultry farms. This study examined the relationship between vehicle movements around poultry farms and the 2014/15 HPAI epidemics in the Republic of Korea using two methods: a boosted regression trees (BRT) model and logistic regression of a generalized linear model (GLM). The BRT model considers the non-linearity association between the frequency of vehicle movements around poultry farms and the HPAI outbreak status per province using a machine learning technique. In contrast, a GLM assesses the relationship based on the traditional frequentist method. Among the three types of vehicle movements (outbound, inbound, and within), only the outbound was found to be a risk factor of the 2014/15 HPAI epidemics according to both the BRT model and multivariate logistic regression of GLM. In the BRT model results, the median relative contribution of the log-transformed outbound variable was 53.68 (range: 39.99 - 67.58) in the 2014 epidemics and 49.79 (range: 33.90 - 56.38) in the 2015 epidemics. In the GLM results, the odds ratio of the log-transformed outbound variable was 1.22 for the 2014 HPAI epidemics (p < 0.001) and 2.48 for the 2015 HPAI epidemics (p < 0.001), respectively. The results indicated that intensive disinfection measures on outbound movement were needed to reduce the risk of HPAI spread. The current BRT models are suitable for risk analysis because the median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.83 (range: 0.74 - 0.91) and 0.85 (range: 0.73 - 0.87) for the 2014 and 2015 epidemics models, respectively. The Akaike information criterion scores for the multivariate logistic regression of GLM were 150.27 and 78.21 for the 2014 and 2015 epidemics models, respectively.

Until now, genre education has mainly consisted of strong classification and framing centered on the formal or expressive characteristics of each genre. Weak classification and framing are also found in the partial development of studies related to genre-recognition education. However, it is difficult to find genre instruction that actually helps students to recontextualize their writing knowledge and skills into different genre contexts. This study defines recontextualization as a selective transformation of writing knowledge and skills learned in the existing context, taking into account the characteristics of the target context in genre education. For recontextualization-focused genre instruction, this study provides general principles drawn mainly from studies of writing and recontextualization and provides a RC model (recontextualization-focused genre instruction model) with an example of applying the model in a university composition class for first-year students. Although empirical research is still needed to prove the model, this research is meaningful as a pioneering study in that it provides a specific way to teach recontextualization in writing classrooms."

UCC 제9편은 담보의 실질을 가지는 모든 제도를 포괄하여 담보권으로 파악하고, 담보권의 성립과 제3자에 대한 대항력 취득을 구별하며, 담보권의 공시방법으로 통지등기제도를 채용하고, 사적 실행을 광범위하게 허용하는 특징을 지녔다. 이러한 UCC 모델은 한편으로는 캐나다, 호주, 뉴질랜드 등 영 연방 국가들로 확장되었고, 다른 한편으로는 각종 국제 모델법을 통하여 대륙법계 국가들로도 확장되었다. 국제 모델법으로서는 UNCITRAL의 입법지침과 모델법 등이 특히 주목할 만하다. 이러한 일련의 규범들에 내재한 기본 원리는 포괄성, 효율성, 자율성으로 요약할 수 있다. 아울러 이러한 규범들은 채무자의 자금 조달 길을 넓히기 위해 역설적으로 채권자 친화적 규정들을 채용하였다.우리나라 동산담보법제는 이러한 국제 흐름을 상당 부분 채용하였으나 대내적으로는 실효성 있는 성과를 거두지 못하고 있고, 대외적으로도 충분히 좋은 평가를 받지 못하고 있다. 이러한 문제의식 아래 정부는 2018년부터 동산담보금융 활성화를 위한 각종 정책을 구현하고 있고, 2020년 3월에는 동산채권담보법 개정안을 제출하였다. 이 개정안은 국회 임기 만료로 폐기되었으나, 향후 입법적 개선의 동력은 여전히 남아 있다. 향후 입법적 개선 방향은 ① 법의 외연(인적 범위, 시적 범위, 물적 범위)의 확장,　② 통지등기제도의 변형적 채택 검토, ③ 담보목적물의 보존 장치 강화(형사처벌 조항 신설 포함), ④ 사적 실행 활성화, ⑤ 양도담보 제도와의 관계 정리 등으로 요약할 수 있다.","The「Act on Security over Movable and Receivable, etc」was enacted on 10 July 2010 and became effective on 11 June 2012. This legislative measure was obviously a landmark turning point in Korea’s secured transaction law. However, this new legislation was not welcomed and utilizied as much as it had been expected. Despite the government’s paternalistic intervention to boost secured transactions on movable and claims, it still account for insignificant portion of the whole secured transactions. It is not only governmental policy measures but also reshaping and improvement of the law itself that will motivate the market players to be more actively involved with the utilization of this new legal vehicle. Against this background, I evaulated and discussed the current legal regime in Korea in light of the international trend in the secured transactions law as well as fundamental principles enshrined therein. On this basis, I also presented some proposals for the improvement of the domestic legal regime.UCC Article 9 is considered a prototype of a modern secured transaction law. The UCC model did away with complex, fragmented and inconsistent legal regime and came up with a comprehensive framework encompassing all types of security interests without regard to its legal formality. Further, it separated the attachment and perfection of a security right, adopted a notification registration system, and allowed bigger room for private enforcement. This model has been extended to British Commonwealth countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand on the one hand, and on the other hand to continental law countries through various international model laws. As for international model law, UNCITRAL's legislative guidelines and model law are particularly noteworthy. The basic principles underlying this set of norms can be summed up as comprehensiveness, efficiency, and autonomy. In addition, these norms adopted creditor-friendly provisions to ultimately broaden the path for debtor's financing.Korea has adopted this international trend to a large extent, but it still has its own internal and external limitations. Bearing this in mind, the Korean government recently employed and implemented various policies for revitalization of secured transactions based on the new law. The Korean government even submitted, in March 2020, a revised bill of the law. Although the revision of the law did not take place due to the expiration of the term of office in the National Assembly, there remains a momentum for future legislative measures. In implementing these measures, ① expansion of the scope of the law so as to cover more debtors in more secured transactions on more assets, ② review of the possibility of adopting a notice registration system, albeit in a transformational form, ③ reinforcement of the preservation and monitoring of the assets (including the introduction of sanction provisions), ④ the vitalization of private enforcement, and ⑤ dealing with the issue of the transfer of ownership for security, which seems to be an obstacle in the utilization of the new law, are the topics to be addressed."

Due to the low level of utilization of classification system and drawing standards compared to other infrastructures, and the closed nature of national security facilities, ports have insufficient level of connection and sharing environment among external systems or users. In addition, since the standardization of data for port facilities is not made, it is still necessary to establish an independent DB for each system and to ensure interoperability of data between these systems since it does not have a shared environment among similar data. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop and verify IFC, the international standard for BIM, in order to cope with the BIM environment and to be commonly used in the design, construction, and maintenance of port facilities. To this end, we build a standard schema with port-specific Express Notation according to buildingSMART International's standard development methodology. First, domestic and international reference model standards were analyzed to derive components such as space and facilities of port facilities. Based on this, the components of the port facility were derived through the codification, categorization, and normalization process developed by the research team. This was extended based on the port BIM object classification system developed by the research team. Normalization results were verified by designers and associations. Then, IFC schema construction was based on Express-G data modeling based on IFC 4 * 2 Candidate, which is a bridge candidate standard based on IFC4 (ISO16739), and IFC 4 * 3 Draft, which is developed by buildingSMART International. The final schema was validated using the commercialized validation tool. In addition, in order to verify the structural verification of the port IFC schema, the transformation process was verified by converting the caisson model into a Part21 file. In the future, this result will not only be used as a delivery standard for port BIM products, but will also be applied as a linkage standard between systems and a common data format for port BIM platforms when BIM is used in the maintenance phase. In particular, it is expected to be used as a core standard for data exchange in the port maintenance stage."

The landscape architects, acting as computer programmers, tried to explore various techniques for landscape analysis and design with a piece of software, and various experts within the field of landscape architecture collaborated with each other. However, landscape architects mainly used computer technology as a tool as a substitute for hands-on cases. Since around the 2000s, the discourse on mapping and diagrammatic techniques as a visualization technique for landscaping processes have begun. Also, realistic representations for perspective drawings using graphic software have been increasingly important. The landscape architects, acting as graphic designers, focused on the specific visualization techniques for landscape planning and design. However, computer technology has been mainly used to produce realistic visuals aids for final presentations instead of creative exploration to generate landforms. Additionally, recent landscape architects have been using landscape performance modeling and parametric modeling for landform and landscape furniture design. The landscape architects as spatial designers are actively using computer modeling as creative form-generating tools during the design process."
Sustainable Economic Development and Resource-Saving: Interrelation and Mutual Influence,2020,"['A Model of Sustainable Development', 'Assessment of the Efficiency of Production', 'Logical Connection', 'Scarce Resources', 'Efficiency']",,"The issues of resource-saving are the central problem in the national economy in general and in the economy of the enterprise. The assessment of production efficiency and resource-saving programs is one of the most important conditions that determine the validity of management decisions. This study focuses on the complexities of the transition from a consumption economy to the development based on a reasonable balance between consumption and environmental conservation. The main purpose is to illustrate the relationship between the factors of resource-saving and sustainable development of the economy. The methods of communication modeling based on reducing the dimension of the factor space through Hotelling transformations are used. Displaying such a logical connection determines the need for a stimulating effect on the joint activities of production units of enterprises and scientific institutions. As a result, the economy obtains the following benefits: a new understanding of efficiency based on the consideration of the cost of natural goods and the damage from anti-environmental decisions; the benefits of improving technologies of lean production, recovery, the organization of production and labor."
Finding the Causal Relations among Key Competencies in Microbreweries: A Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Approach,2020,"['Competency Model', 'Multi Criteria Decision Making', 'DEMATEL', 'Microbrewery']",,"The brewing market in Brazil goes through an important transformation where the craft beer, which is carried out in the so-called “microbreweries” has gained more space and consumers. Driven by the entry of increasingly new microbreweries, competition in an unstable economic environment makes the survival of these small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) difficult. SMEs need to constantly improving their human resource in order to survive in the business arena. This paper tries to extract the competencies using a competency model for head brewer job position. Then a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is used to find the causal relations among key competencies in Brazilian microbrewery industry. The competencies are in four groups including: managerial, interpersonal, technical and personal. The results show that the managerial group of competencies is the most important group in head brewer job position. The results show that the “active listening”, “mental agility”, “emotional resilience” and “proactivity” have the highest level of influence on the other competencies. To the best our knowledge, this is the first application of competency model and DEMATEL in microbrewery industry."

This analytical process will contribute to the further understanding of the historical transformation of the German corporatism and also the drop of the support rates on the moderate national parties, especially, on the SPD with its background of political crisis it faced nowadays. Two steps will be taken for this process. In the first step, Chapter 2 will survey several theoretical arguments over the changes of the corporatism. Here, due attention will be paid to the advent of a new type of corporatism, which is called, competitive corporatism, since the class compromise was shrank in Western Europe. In the second step of the Ch 3, the historical transformation of the German corporatism will be discussed. The time between late 1990s and early 2000s was decisively important in the historical transformation of the German corporatism. During this transitional period, the revival of corporatism was proceeded in the name of ‘Alliance for Work’. This alliance, however, failed with the degeneration of its goal itself, which resulted in wage suppression just accepting a one way demand of the management and government over the labour, rather than trying to make compromises between labour and capital. This failure shows that the German corporatism has been transformed into an unilateral and mere symbolic one in the end."

This study proposed a method of using quaternions and Procrustes algorithms to fit different three-dimensional coordinate systems using points and straight lines. Rotational elements were calculated using quaternions by projecting the coordinates of the points in the model coordinate system onto those in the reference coordinate system. For the scale factor and three-dimensional translation, Procrustes algorithms using points and straight lines were then used. Indoor experiments using checker-boards were conducted, followed by experiments using outdoor data acquired from a terrestrial mobile mapping system. It was found that more than four point-to-line pairs are needed to perform three-dimensional transformation reliably."

The in-depth process of the relationship between a performer’s action and the transformative effects, is central to understanding and adapting the key principle of acting/training that a specific text would pursue through a specific performance by means of what a performer must do on stage. Following the discussion of acting in training and rehearsal, this thesis argues the necessity of an alternative way(s) and model of the performer’s work via how the performer’s action is sincerely emerged from the moment-by-moment rather than the performer anticipates what comes in the next and therefore pretend to do/be something/someone. Expanding upon the assumptions mentioned above, this thesis provides some pragmatic and descriptive work(s) from the practitioners’ concepts and approaches that invites us to reconsider the nature of acting and its adaptability for contemporary performers."

The ethical climate of the public sector is a core aspect in acquiring the citizens’ trust on the state, as well as in improving organizational performance. Domestic studies to date on the ethical climate of an organization has focused on its effects on private-sector organizations, and there are a limited number of empirical studies on the antecedents of ethical climate formation. Thus, this study has examined whether the factor of transformational leadership plays a role as an antecedent in creating transformational leadership. Moreover, this study has also examined whether communication, previously proven to be an antecedent in ethical climate, influences the relationship between these two variables as a moderator. To verify the research model and research hypotheses, a survey was conducted with 350 public-sector workers in 15 public institutions in Seoul, Gyeonggi, Busan, Gwangju, Jeonnam and Sejong City followed by hierarchical regression analysis. The results of the analysis showed that the sub-variables of transformational leadership, composed of idealized influence, inspirational motivation and intellectual stimulation did not influence egoistic-local climate, but had positive influences on benevolent-local and principled-local climates. The results of this study indicated that the moderating effects of communication were non-existent in the relationship between transformational leadership and ethical climate."

Fitting CAD data to scanned data with large deformation,2020,"['non-rigid registration', 'large deformation', 'matching']",,"Recently, largely deformed simulation models, such as car crash simulations, have been in high demand. To evaluate such models, it is necessary to use actual deformation results to compare and validate them. When measuring actual deformed objects, an X-ray CT is useful because it is non-destructive. However, matching undeformed CAD data and scanned deformation data is difficult. We propose a system for users to set control points or control lines on feature points and predict deformation using affine transformation with the moving least squares method. In the proposed method, undesirable distortions are reduced by evaluating scaling using singular value index and introducing offset control points.The deformed CAD data are obtained by matching predicted CAD data and a polygon mesh generated by deformed CT data.In addition, the surface elements of the generated deformed CAD data are evaluated for CAE."

NCS기반 교육은 전문대학의 특성을 반영한 것이었지만, 한편으로 교양교육을 약화시키는 결과를초래하기도 하였다. 전문대학의 교육과정이 역량기반으로 전환되고 있는 지금 전문대학 교양교육의변화는 매우 절실하다.D대학의 교양교육과정 개발 절차는 ADDIE 모형을 기반으로 하되, 각 단계에 따른 개발 과정은역량 중심에 초점을 맞추었다. 이 글에서는 ‘분석-설계-개발’ 단계의 구체적인 진행과정을 살펴보았다.분석 단계에서는 교양교육을 둘러싼 외부환경 및 내부역량을 분석하여 교양교육과정 개발전략을 도출하였다. 산업체와 학생들 대상으로 수요자 만족도를 분석하였으며, 대학의 핵심역량 및 하위역량, 행동지표를 점검하였다. 설계 단계에서는 핵심역량 함양을 위한 교양교육목표 및 교양교육정책을 수립하였다.교양교육목표는 대학의 인재상, 교육목표, 핵심역량과의 연계성을 고려하였으며, 교양교육정책은 직업기초능력 및 기초학습능력 교육과의 연관성을 고려하여 수립하였다. 또한 교양교육목표 및 대학 특성을반영한 교양교육영역을 설정하였다. 개발 단계에서는 역량기반 교양교과목을 도출하였다. 교과목 도출시 수요자 요구분석 결과를 반영하였으며, 최종 교과목 도출 후 역량 중심의 교과목 프로파일을 작성하였다. 그 결과 D대학은 교양교육영역별로 다양한 역량기반 교과목을 도출할 수 있었는데, 역량기반 교양교육이 효과적으로 운영되기 위해서는 몇 가지 과제가 남아 있다.무엇보다 교양교육을 전담하는 기구와 인력을 확보하는 일이 중요하다. 교양교육 전담기구와 인력, 교양이수학점 등이 확보된다면 역량기반 교양교육과정은 체계적인 운영이 가능하기 때문이다. 전문대학의 역량기반 교양교육은 지금부터가 시작이다. 앞으로 전문대학 교양교육에 대한 많은 연구들이 진행되어 핵심역량 함양을 위한 교양교육이 실현될 수 있기를 바란다.","This study presents a model through the case of D-college for how to develop competency-based Liberal Arts courses in colleges. Since 2014, many colleges have developed and operated an NCS-based curriculum. However, although NCS-based education reflected the characteristics of colleges, it also resulted in the weakening of Liberal Arts education for those colleges.For institutions of higher learning, the importance of Liberal Arts education is relatively low, due to short lectures and a major-oriented education system. At a time when the curriculum of colleges is being transformed into a competency-based one, it is very urgent to change the Liberal Arts education of colleges.The process of developing Liberal Arts education courses at D-college is based on the ADDIE model, but the development process at each stage focused on capacity centers. This article looked at the specific progress of the ‘Analysis-Design -Development’ phase. In the analysis phase, the external environment, internal capacity, and satisfaction of the educational needs were analyzed, while the core competency of the colleges in question was checked. In the design phase, Liberal Arts education goals and policies were established, and Liberal Arts education areas were set. In the development phase, competency-based Liberal Arts subjects were derived and a curriculum profile was developed.As a result, D-college has been able to derive a variety of competency-based subjects, with several tasks remaining for the education to operate effectively. If organizations, human resources, Liberal Arts and math are secured, the competency-based Liberal Arts education process can be operated systematically."

Due to the electromagnetic characteristics of a single-phase PMSM, negative and zero torques are generated in the part corresponding to the phase difference between the stator current and the back electromotive force. In addition, overcurrent limitation is required because of the low stator resistance and inductance in sensorless operation. When using the vector control for current control of single-phase PMSM under these conditions, processes of coordinate transformation, inverse coordinate transformation, and generation of virtual dq-axis components are required. However, the proposed variable speed proportional resonant current control method does not need the coordinate transformation used for AC motors. In this paper, we have confirmed stable maneuverability by using variable proportional resonant current control algorithm, and proposed sensorless control based on a mathematical model of a single-phase PMSM without a position sensor when reaching a constant speed. The usefulness of the current control method was verified through several experiments."

Sup’ung hydropower plant linked the north industrial area of colonial Korea with newly developed cities in Manchuria through high-voltage transmission lines. Consequently, Korean and Manchuria had more stable electric power systems as compared to the Japanese system, which was still based upon small- and middle-scale power plants. This paper explores how this innovation of electric power system was made possible in the colonial periphery of the Japanese empire. Originally, the innovation began in colonial Korea when large-scale power plants were advanced as product of negotiation between Nitchitu and Government-General of Korea in the early 1930s. Since the Nippon Chisso Hiryō(Nitchitu) had failed to acquire sufficient electricity in Japan, it tried to secure new power resources in Korea; the Government-General of Korea, suffering from the resistance of existing power suppliers and the lack of enough money for stabilizing the public power system, chose Nitchitu as an ideal partner. The cooperation between two made the construction of large-scale plants, which would provide the foundation not only for expanding Nitchitu business, but also for the stable grid system in the colony. Sup’ung dam was the third plant constructed by their partnership, and the first plant, built by cooperation between colonial Korea and Manchukuo. A Newly “independent” country, Manchukuo, established in 1932 by Japanese Kwantung army, launched a strong government-led industrialization program. Kwantung army and young Japanese reformist bureaucrats planed big industrial cities and heavy chemical industrial complexes that required abundant power resources. Finding an ideal model of electric power system from colonial Korea, not Japan, they suggested the plan for construction of large-scale plants to the Government-General of Korea. Soon, this international project for constructing large scale plants at Yalu River was materialized. Nitchitu played an important role in mediating the two colonial governments’ uneasy partnership as well as providing technology and experience of construction. When their interests were conflicted, Nitchitu built bridges by suggesting practical and flexible solutions. One of the problems was that two countries used different power frequencies. In a way that tooled up generators of each country’s exclusive use, instead of unifying two systems, they could avoid social controversy as well as saving money and time. In the end, the two countries shared Sup’ung plant while at the same time preserving different electric power systems. In Colonial Korea, Sup’ung plant was connected a multiplicity of factories and houses via existing power suppliers’ distribution. In Manchukuo, it, as the result of development led by strong nation, provided power for planed industrial cities, and become a part of fanatical nationalistic system."

Augmented-reality-assisted workpiece localization in rod-type flexible fixtures,2020,['· Augmented reality · Point-in-polygon · Rigid transformation · Thin-walled components · Workpiece localization'],,"This study proposes an augmented reality (AR)-assisted workpiece-localization technique for rod-type flexible fixtures used in automotive and aerospace industries, for machining thin-walled components. The machining accuracy of a component depends considerably on the profile error and envelopment condition of the blank workpiece. An AR virtual reference of the component is created in the image space using a pinhole camera with a lens distortion model that visually assists the rough placement of the workpiece at the desired location. The fine workpiece-localization process is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem to minimize the profile error. The problem is subjected to a point-in-polygon constraint in the image space to guarantee the envelopment requirement. The proposed method is validated using an aircraft body panel. It uses only the measurement data acquired from the upper surface of the panel and the AR reference and is a more flexible and accurate solution than the locating-pin method."

After conducting process planning on the machining target, local deformation of motion units in cutting positions is considered using a geometric way. A mathematical model is then established describing the influence of local deformation error on the general machining error through homogeneous transformation matrices. Conceptual model of the machine tool is constructed to obtain deformation distribution using static FEA. Error sensitivity coefficients are then calculated and compared among all alternative kinematic chains to select the optimized scheme. The proposed method is verified through a designing example of a fi ve-axis vertical machining center. The optimized kinematic chain could lower the magnitude of deformation sensitivities by 9.69% and increase error equalization variance by 71.25% compared to the conventional method."

A total of 1,733 university students were surveyed on the intolerance of uncertainty, worry, meta-worry, and cognitive avoidance. The results are as follows: All mediators showed statistically significant partial mediation effects in the two relations(intolerance of uncertainty and worry, worry and meta-worry). However, the relative mediating effect size of the subtypes was different. In the relation between the intolerance of uncertainty and worry, thought suppression represented the largest mediation effect. On the other hand, the relation between worry and meta-worry showed that thought suppression was the smallest, and transformation of images into thoughts was the largest. These results suggest that for effective intervention for worry symptoms, it is necessary to consider the mediating characteristics of cognitive avoidance that appear differently according to the pathological progression of anxiety."

Rossby Waves and Beta Gyre Associated with Tropical Cyclone-scale Barotropic Vortex on the Sphere,2020,"['tropical cyclones', 'Rossby waves', 'beta drift', 'barotropic models', 'shallow water equations', 'spherical harmonics spectral method']",,"Tropical cyclone scale vortices and associated Rossby waves were investigated numerically using high-resolution barotropic models on the global domain. The equations of the barotropic model were discretized using the spectral transform method with the spherical harmonics function as orthogonal basis. The initial condition of the vortex was specified as an axisymmetric flow in the gradient wind balance, and four types of basic zonal states were employed. Vortex tracks showed similar patterns as those on the beta-plane but exhibited more eastward displacement as they moved northward. The zonal-mean flow appeared to control not only the west-east translation but also the meridional translation of the vortex. Such a meridional influence was revealed to be associated with the beta gyre and the Rossby wave, which are formed around the vortex due to the beta effect. In the case of the basic zonal state of climatological mean, the meridional translation speed reached the maximum value when the vortex underwent recurving."

Four higher order shear deformation beam theories are considered in formulation and analysis. So, the model can consider the influence of both thick and thin beams without needing to shear correction factor. The compression force can be described through axial direction by uniform constant, linear and parabolic distribution functions. The Hamilton’s principle is exploited to derive equilibrium governing equations of unified sandwich laminated beams. The governing equilibrium differential equations are transformed to algebraic system of equations by using numerical differential quadrature method (DQM). The system of equations is solved as an eigenvalue problem to get critical buckling loads and their corresponding mode-shapes. The stability of DQM in determining of buckling loads of sandwich structure is performed. The validation studies are achieved and the obtained results are matched with those. Parametric studies are presented to figure out effects of in-plane load type, sandwich thickness, fiber orientation and boundary conditions on buckling loads and mode-shapes. The present model is important in designing process of aircraft, naval structural components, and naval structural when non-uniform in-plane compressive loading is dominated."

This situation raises the need for both South and North Korea to seek ways to innovate in preparation for technological and industrial structural changes in digitalization from a futureoriented perspective, beyond discussing exchanges and cooperation in traditional fields and ranges.This paper aims to find areas where inter-Korean cooperation is possible based on ICT and to present step-by-step strategies for the virtuous circle effect of cooperation. In response to changes in the future-oriented industrial structure, ICT cooperation that the two Koreas should prepare for is a high-tech leading field on the premise of enhancing their knowledge and research innovation capabilities, a field on solving problems of people’s livelihood to create tangible results, a disaster and ecological environment improvement that are relatively easy to approach on a humanitarian and justifiable level, and a field on the development of resources and energy infrastructure to improve the overall infrastructure environment in the mid-oriented North Korea region.These areas should be pursued simultaneously to secure momentum for inter-Korean exchanges, but they should be approached gradually from the stage of laying the foundation for cooperation, taking into account the current intensive international sanctions environment. It is also necessary to establish a mid- to long-term cooperative model so that cooperation in each field can lead to a virtuous circle of ripple effects linked to the industry as a whole.In implementing these roadmaps, the two Koreas will be able to proactively respond to industrial changes in the digital transition period, while also contributing to the establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula and the stabilization of the supply chain in Northeast Asia."

Major Harmonic generation efects due to non-linear loads are energy loss, nuisance tripping, equipment failure/mal-operation, and transformer saturation, overheating of neutral conductors and/or capacitors, interference with communication circuits, excess reactive power burden and lowering the true power factor. Improving the current quality is the prime responsibility of the consumers whereas utility is accountable for minimizing the supply voltage distortions. Shunt active flters (SAFs) were being used for many years to mitigate the current harmonics typically up to 25th order. Mainly, time and frequency domain reference current extraction control techniques were being used for SAF. Time-domain reference current extraction techniques were proved efcient than frequency-domain techniques due to their faster response. Time-domain reference current extraction techniques such as real and reactive (p-q) and synchronous reference frame (SRF) are having their own merits and demerits. The p-q control does not perform well under distorted and unbalanced supply voltage conditions whereas SRF control is limited to balanced loads. In this paper a novel reference current extraction control strategy is proposed i.e. inverse matrix averaging pq-SRF (IMApq-SRF) control. IMApq-SRF control extract the features of both conventional p-q and SRF control, based on inverse matrix average. The mathematical modeling of the proposed IMApq-SRF control is tested with MATLAB Simulink environment and it validates that the proposed IMApq-SRF control gives the superior performance as compared with conventional p-q and SRF techniques under balanced, unbalanced and distorted supply voltage and dynamic loading conditions."

Therefore, this research explored the smart mobility innovation ecosystem based on the case of Paris, France, which is a leading city for smart mobility, by using the Quintuple Helix model (Government, Industry, University, Social Culture, and Natural Environment), which is an innovation network theory. As the result of analysis, the France government is carrying out various innovations by financial and institutional supports such as EVRA project, PACTE Act, and LOM Act. On the industry side, the scale-up of startups is actively underway through Station F's Moove Lab program. On the university side, Paris-Saclay University is leading innovation by building a smart mobility test bed on their campus as a autonomous lab project cooperated with industries. Finally, the Paris Liberté Living-lab promotes citizen’s acceptance of mobility innovation in terms of social culture, and the promotion of smart mobility is socially active to solve the air pollution problems of Paris in terms of natural environment.

This study raises the question of how the local cooperative governance for local development in the 4th industrial revolution can be established. In order to answer these questions, how to categorize smart governance for smart city pilot projects (clear objectives and visions, participation of various related actors, and the process of governance) that are proposed as an alternative to local development in the fourth industrial revolution era. And how the elements that make up this smart governance are embodied in the pilot projects in Germany and Korea. To this end, we compared the cases of Korea and Germany, which have recently started pilot program of smart cities, according to their types. Both Korea and Germany have well-equipped infrastructure for smart cities. In Germany, the international norms of sustainable development and Germany""s domestic purpose of digital transformation were clearly stated, whereas in Korea, it was clear that it focused on the economic growth among the goals of sustainable development constitute the economic, social, and environment pillars. Regarding actors, Germany showed a bottom-up approach while Korea showed top-down approach with various attempts for citizen participation. In terms of the process, in Germany, organizations that served as a governance platform for coordination were noticeable, but in Korea, the governance platform was still absent."

The data comprised examples of students’ English job applications, and a ‘purpose-will’ model was adopted for the data analysis. The findings showed that the students used unique ways of strategies to convey their voice in a recontextualized setting. Their written voice in the job applications were various, and nobody applied the Korean convention of weather opening. Their rhetorical patterns were a transformation from convergence to divergence, showing integrated patterns of written voice. Students’ writing practices revealed their internal values of writing for a task, and they do not directly learn from the teachers syllabus. This supports the sociocultural framework that learning is a situated activity in a specific discourse community. The study concludes that writing teachers should understand that life-world and learning experience can impact on students’ written voice and practices."

Design has also transformed from the traditional design centered on things to the new thinking design mode for the sustainable development of each individual. Among them, speculative design, as a design method oriented by future technology and future society, mainly explores and discusses the potential moral, cultural, social and political implications of science and technology for human beings. It is a tool that can reconstruct existing problems and raise new ones. However, according to the literature analysis, there are still some problems in the speculative design method, such as monotony, subjectivity, moral fuzziness and so on. Based on MacIntyre's moral theory, this paper puts forward six moral evaluation standards and explains them from three aspects: internal standard, external standard and value standard. At the same time, the paper puts forward the model of core moral concepts in practice, which provides a method and principle for speculative design practitioners to face the perception of problems and practices, the interpretation and priority of stakeholder needs."

Defect Classification of Cross-section of Additive Manufacturing Using Image-Labeling,2020,"['Deep Learning(딥러닝)', 'CNN(순환 신경망)', 'Data Augmentation(데이터 증폭)', 'Image Labeling(이미지 라벨링)', 'Additive Manufacturing(적층제조)']",,"Recently, the fourth industrial revolution has been presented as a new paradigm and additive manufacturing (AM) has become one of the most important topics. For this reason, process monitoring for each cross-sectional layer of additive metal manufacturing is important. Particularly, deep learning can train a machine to analyze, optimize, and repair defects. In this paper, image classification is proposed by learning images of defects in the metal cross sections using the convolution neural network (CNN) image labeling algorithm. Defects were classified into three categories: crack, porosity, and hole. To overcome a lack-of-data problem, the amount of learning data was augmented using a data augmentation algorithm. This augmentation algorithm can transform an image to 180 images, increasing the learning accuracy. The number of training and validation images was 25,920 (80 %) and 6,480 (20 %), respectively. An optimized case with a combination of fully connected layers, an optimizer, and a loss function, showed that the model accuracy was 99.7 % and had a success rate of 97.8 % for 180 test images. In conclusion, image labeling was successfully performed and it is expected to be applied to automated AM process inspection and repair systems in the future."
Simulation of nonstationary wind in one-spatial dimension with time-varying coherence by wavenumber-frequency spectrum and application to transmission line,2020,"['nonstationary process', 'fluctuating wind', 'time-varying coherence', 'evolutionary power spectrum', 'wavenumber-frequency spectrum', 'proper orthogonal decomposition', 'Fast Fourier transform', 'transmission tower-line']",,"Practical non-synoptic fluctuating wind often exhibits nonstationary features and should be modeled as nonstationary random processes. Generally, the coherence function of the fluctuating wind field has time-varying characteristics. Some studies have shown that there is a big difference between the fluctuating wind field of the coherent function model with and without time variability. Therefore, it is of significance to simulate nonstationary fluctuating wind field with time-varying coherent function. However, current studies on the numerical simulation of nonstationary fluctuating wind field with time-varying coherence are very limited, and the proposed approaches are usually based on the traditional spectral representation method with low simulation efficiency. Especially, for the simulation of multi-variable wind field of large span structures such as transmission tower-line, not only the simulation is inefficient but also the matrix decomposition may have singularity problem. In this paper, it is proposed to conduct the numerical simulation of nonstationary fluctuating wind field in one-spatial dimension with time-varying coherence based on the wavenumber-frequency spectrum. The simulated multivariable nonstationary wind field with time-varying coherence is transformed into one-dimensional nonstationary random waves in the simulated spatial domain, and the simulation by wavenumber frequency spectrum is derived. So, the proposed simulation method can avoid the complicated Cholesky decomposition. Then, the proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to decompose the time-space dependent evolutionary power spectral density and the Fourier transform of time-varying coherent function, simultaneously, so that the two-dimensional Fast Fourier transform can be applied to further improve the simulation efficiency. Finally, the proposed method is applied to simulate the longitudinal nonstationary fluctuating wind velocity field along the transmission line to illustrate its performances."

Dynamic deflection monitoring of high-speed railway bridges with the optimal inclinometer sensor placement,2020,"['high-speed railway bridge', 'dynamic deflection', 'optimal inclinometer sensor placement', 'inclination-deflection transformation', 'information entropy']",,"Dynamic deflection monitoring is an essential and critical part of structural health monitoring for high-speed railway bridges. Two critical problems need to be addressed when using inclinometer sensors for such applications. These include constructing a general representation model of inclination-deflection and addressing the ill-posed inverse problem to obtain the accurate dynamic deflection. This paper provides a dynamic deflection monitoring method with the placement of optimal inclinometer sensors for high-speed railway bridges. The deflection shapes are reconstructed using the inclination-deflection transformation model based on the differential relationship between the inclination and displacement mode shape matrix. The proposed optimal sensor configuration can be used to select inclination-deflection transformation models that meet the required accuracy and stability from all possible sensor locations. In this study, the condition number and information entropy are employed to measure the ill-condition of the selected mode shape matrix and evaluate the prediction performance of different sensor configurations. The particle swarm optimization algorithm, genetic algorithm, and artificial fish swarm algorithm are used to optimize the sensor position placement. Numerical simulation and experimental validation results of a 5-span high-speed railway bridge show that the reconstructed deflection shapes agree well with those of the real bridge."

Therefore, this paper examined in detail the development of digital economy in China, the main characteristics of industrial policy driving it, and the changes and issues in the labor relations that have arisen based on related policy documents and data. As China's economic growth engine is transformed into innovation and entrepreneurship based on the Internet and digital technologies, various new industries and new models are emerging. As a result, employment paths are diversified, and work methods such as part-time jobs, temporary jobs, and seasonal and flexible jobs are also becoming more flexible. Therefore, there are problems in various areas that are not covered by labor relations based on the existing labor law. Most of all, it is not possible to effectively respond to labor problems derived from working hours, work patterns, wage payments, management rules. because the related legal systems and policy systems for new types of workforce have not yet been completed. In addition, the social security service system needs to be rebuilt in line with the new types of labor, and the need to change the current methods of labor supervision, dispute coordination and arbitration to meet the new types of employment and start-up trends is also raised. In particular, it is worth noting that this change in China can have a direct and indirect effect on Korea's industrial structure and labor policy. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously study the achievements and limitations of the Chinese government's policy efforts surrounding the development of digital economy and changes in labor-society."

Therefore, it is necessary to update the concept of consumer protection, promote the protection model, reconstruct the protection path, and adjust the tilt configuration of the current consumer protection. Consumer protection should move from tilt protection to integration balance protection, from one-way protection to multi-dimensional and overall system protection. At the same time, we are supposed to promote the scientific and legal development of the consumer society based on the consumer credit system.The artificial intelligence economy enables consumers to become active market participants from the end of production and consumption in the traditional market. The prototype of artificial intelligence economic format has begun to take shape. Consumer-centered production and operation activities are becoming more and more common, which blur the boundaries between operators and consumers. The identity structure of the subject tends to be complicated. Consumers and operators continue to share relevant data and information, which greatly enhances the position of consumers in market transactions. The weak positioning of consumers has been greatly improved, and the dominant position of consumers is shaping. The relative market structure of consumers and operators is quietly developing and changing. From the past opposition or even the confrontation mode to cooperation and even the integration model, they have formed a community of interests and a community of destiny.As a high-level form of deep development of the digital economy, the artificial intelligence economy, accompanied by the integration of information technology and data technology, has substantially influenced and tried to subvert the current production and consumption activities under the impetus of the continuous development of operation technology. Combined with the new solution to the legal positioning of consumers in the artificial intelligence scene, it is necessary to accelerate the transformation of consumer protection concepts, improve the protection mode of new “Consumer Protection Law”, and reconstruct the consumer protection rationale. The design and implementation of the Consumer Basic Law in the future should focus on consumer behavior, integrate the balanced protection of the legitimate interests of consumers and operators, completely get rid of the prejudice of “consumer natural weakness”, scientifically and rationally allocate the proportion of rights and obligations between consumers and operators, correct the tendency of consumers to misuse and abuse rights, and clarify the obligations and responsibilities of consumers. While stimulating and supporting consumers to actively exercise various rights, we will guide and nurture consumers to earnestly assume corresponding obligations and responsibilities, and establish a basic consumer legal system based on the consumer credit system as soon as possible.The artificial intelligence technology and industrialization development have brought subversive effects to the production and consumption field, and it is likely to achieve another singular development in the evolution of human society.

Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Attenuates Diabetes- Induced Renal Fibrosis by Negatively Regulating TGF- β-p53-Smad2/3-Mediated Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition via Activation of AKT,2020,"['Epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'Fibroblast growth factor 21', 'Fibrosis', 'Kidney', 'Transforming growth factor beta', 'Tumor suppressor protein p53']",,"Background: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is required for renal fibrosis, which is a characteristic of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Our previous study demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) prevented DN associated with the suppressing renal connective tissue growth factor expression, a key marker of renal fibrosis. Therefore, the effects of FGF21 on renal fibrosis in a DN mouse model and the underlying mechanisms were investigated in this study.Methods: Type 1 diabetes mellitus was induced in C57BL/6J mice by intraperitoneal injections of multiple low doses of streptozotocin.Then, diabetic and non-diabetic mice were treated with or without FGF21 in the presence of pifithrin-α (p53 inhibitor) or 10-[4´-(N,N-Diethylamino)butyl]-2-chlorophenoxazine hydrochloride (10-DEBC) hydrochloride (Akt inhibitor) for 4 months.Results: DN was diagnosed by renal dysfunction, hypertrophy, tubulointerstitial lesions, and glomerulosclerosis associated with severe fibrosis, all of which were prevented by FGF21. FGF21 also suppressed the diabetes-induced renal EMT in DN mice by negatively regulating transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-induced nuclear translocation of Smad2/3, which is required for the transcription of multiple fibrotic genes. The mechanistic studies showed that FGF21 attenuated nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 by inhibiting renal activity of its conjugated protein p53, which carries Smad2/3 into the nucleus. Moreover pifithrin-α inhibited the FGF21-induced preventive effects on the renal EMT and subsequent renal fibrosis in DN mice. In addition, 10-DEBC also blocked FGF21-induced inhibition of renal p53 activity by phosphorylation of mouse double minute-2 homolog (MDM2).Conclusion: FGF21 prevents renal fibrosis via negative regulation of the TGF-β/Smad2/3-mediated EMT process by activation of the Akt/MDM2/p53 signaling pathway."
Molecular Signatures of Sinus Node Dysfunction Induce Structural Remodeling in the Right Atrial Tissue,2020,"['cardiac fibrosis', 'periostin', 'right atrium', 'sinus node dysfunction', 'transcriptome', 'transforming growth factor- ${\\beta}$']",,"The sinus node (SN) is located at the apex of the cardiac conduction system, and SN dysfunction (SND)-characterized by electrical remodeling-is generally attributed to idiopathic fibrosis or ischemic injuries in the SN. SND is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disorders, including syncope, heart failure, and atrial arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. One of the histological SND hallmarks is degenerative atrial remodeling that is associated with conduction abnormalities and increased right atrial refractoriness. Although SND is frequently accompanied by increased fibrosis in the right atrium (RA), its molecular basis still remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated whether SND can induce significant molecular changes that account for the structural remodeling of RA. Towards this, we employed a rabbit model of experimental SND, and then compared the genome-wide RNA expression profiles in RA between SND-induced rabbits and sham-operated controls to identify the differentially expressed transcripts. The accompanying gene enrichment analysis revealed extensive pro-fibrotic changes within 7 days after the SN ablation, including activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and alterations in the levels of extracellular matrix components and their regulators. Importantly, our findings suggest that periostin, a matricellular factor that regulates the development of cardiac tissue, might play a key role in mediating TGF-β-signaling-induced aberrant atrial remodeling. In conclusion, the present study provides valuable information regarding the molecular signatures underlying SND-induced atrial remodeling, and indicates that periostin can be potentially used in the diagnosis of fibroproliferative cardiac dysfunctions."

In particular, there have been increased interests in HR analytics which utilizes the technologies to process various data collected in organizations. Among recent studies related to HR analytics, the number of quantitative research is less than the number of qualitative research. Many methods in machine learning and artificial intelligence are based on Bayesian statistics, but researchers and practitioners in HR Analytics, who are more experienced in social science and frequentist statistics, have relatively less experiences in the Bayesian methods. Despite the use of various methods in predictive business analytics such as Bayesian network, naive Bayes and topic modeling, Bayesian statistics has not been thoroughly introduced and has been rarely used in the HR fields. In this study, we provide an introduction to Bayesian statistics and examples of Bayesian data analysis for the wide use of Bayesian methods in HR analytics. In addition, we analyzed data of executives in an organization and explained which capability is highly associated with the probability of retirement. This is in line with HR analytics studies that characterizes successful and unsuccessful leaders, which is of great interest, and this research has contributions to both academia and practice as there has been little progress in Korea."

There is not much empiric research, however, that has investigated whether that is indeed the case. To fill this gap, this study investigates the effects of institutional quality on economic growth with a focus on East Asia before and after the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, which delivered a critical shock in economic activities and institutions in East Asia. Using panel data analysis from 1981 and 2007, I investigate whether the effect of institutional quality on economic growth differed in East Asia compared to rest of the world before the crisis and whether such relationship changed after the crisis. Using two-way fixed effects model, the estimation shows that the effect of institutional quality on economic growth was positive on average for the rest of the world after the crisis but negative for East Asia. The negative coefficient was particularly strong for the three countries—South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand—that suffered the most during the crisis. However, in the long term, there was no significant change of this negative effect."

It also reveals that freshmen show the lower level of digital competency as compared with other graders, especially in computational thinking, skills about data and information, coding skills, and digital contents creation. On the other hand, female students have strong professional accountabilities in data and a better understanding of digital citizenship. It implies that engineering education necessarily emphasizes the importance of proving digital training to freshmen year curricula and gives opportunities so they can continuously adapt to the changes that occurred by technologies. It is also important to consider teaching a problem skill in data analyzing, transform, visualization, and evaluation, also establish their computational thinking. The scale has been developed can be used to measure college students' learning outcomes and it will provide practical implementations for college engineering education."

However, what is most important in creating a sustainable start-up ecosystem is not the start-up itself, but the process of research-start-investment-investment-the leap to listing and big business-in order to build a virtuous circle of startups that leads to re-investment. To this end, the environment created in the hub area where start-ups were conducted is important, and these material and non-material environmental factors are described as being inclusive by the word ""entrepreneurial ecosystem."" This study aims to provide implications for Korea's entrepreneurial ecosystem through the study of the interaction of the elements that make up the start-up ecosystem and the relationship of ecosystem participants in Singapore. Singapore has been consistently mentioned as the top two Asian countries in assessing the start-up environment and business environment. In this process, six elements of the entrepreneurial ecosystem presented by Isenberg(2010)-policies, finance, culture, support, human resources, and market-are the best frameworks for analyzing entrepreneurial ecosystems in terms of well encompassing prior studies related to entrepreneurial ecosystem elements, and a model of regional transformation is formed focusing on some elements to suit Singapore, the target area of study. By considering that Singapore's political nature would inevitably have a huge impact on finance, Smart Nation policy was having an impact on university education related to entrepreneurship, and that the entrepreneurial networks and global connectivity formed within Singapore's start-up infrastructure had a significant impact on Singapore's start-up's performance, researches needed to look more at the factors of policy, culture and market. In addition, qualitative research of participants in the entrepreneurial ecosystem was essential to understand the internal interaction of the elements of the start-up ecosystem, so the semi-structured survey was conducted by visiting the site. As such, this study examined the status of the local entrepreneurial ecosystem based on qualitative research focused on policies, culture and market elements of Singapore's start-up ecosystem, and intended to provide implications for regulations related to start-ups, the role of universities and start-up infrastructure through comparison with Korea. This could contribute not only to the future research of the start-up ecosystem, but also to the creation of a start-up infrastructure, boosting the start-up ecosystem, and the establishment of the orientation of the start-up education in universities."
A robust genome-editing method for wild plant species Nicotiana attenuata,2020,['CRISPR\xa0· Plant tissue culture\xa0· Regeneration\xa0· Wild tobacco\xa0· Ecological model species'],,"CRISPR genome-editing techniques theoretically enable us to edit any genes in any plants. However, plant tissue culture is required for generating targeted mutants in plants, except in some model plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana.To modify ecologically or agronomically important traits in plants using the CRISPR system, a robust plant regeneration method and efcient genome-editing tools must be developed. This study shows the entire process of genome editing and the regeneration process for wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata. We delivered T-DNA harboring Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) and guide RNA (gRNA) via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into the hypocotyl cells of the wild tobacco and regenerated gene-edited plants. The efcacy of genome editing was measured in N. attenuata protoplasts in which SpCas9 and gRNA were transiently expressed. Light intensity (476.66–627.00 μW/cm2 , 20.69–52.21 μE) was optimized to enhance the emergence of plant shoots during callus induction, and the core step of dealing with plant tissues was recorded.In addition, we found that wounding the bottom part of mature plants was critical for root regeneration. By tracking mutation patterns and efciency at each regeneration step, we found that the mutation was induced early on in the tissue culture process and maintained throughout the regeneration process. Genome-editing techniques have opened the way to study the function of the genes in all plants, and this study will provide guidelines for editing a gene in the plant of interest."

However, as many marketers see the importance of membeship marketing, many firms still don""t clearly understand the unique characteristics of their paid membership customers so that the firms can transform them into loyal customers. Surprisingly, there are very few researches to study the unique characteristics of paid membership customers, that is, investigating how they are different from no-membership customers in terms of the type of service, their interest/ concern, and their expectation in purchasing experience. Therefore, this study explore and compare the key issues between customers with and without paid membership in e-commerce business. The differences in the key issues were derived from text-mining technique(i.e., LDA topic modeling and word frequency analysis) with the customer review data. For the results of the LDA topic modeling, we derived topics of membership, purchased products, events, and payment methods from the customers with paid membership, and membership and purchased products from the customers without paid membership. In addition, for the result of the word frequency analysis, we derived issues of price discount from the customers with paid membership, and purchase/use experience and product information from the customers without paid membership. The result of this study has practical implication that contribute to provide the detailed marketing strategies for each customer group based on the better comparative understanding of paid membership customers over no membership customer group."

It is important to review the contents and limitations and to seek future improvement measures of the energy transition policy through existing legislation at this point in time when a grand transformation is needed to respond to climate change.Although the agenda of ‘energy transition’ was explicitly reflected in the policy at the time when the ‘Follow-up measures to publicize the ShinGori Unit 5 and 6 and Roadmap for Energy Transition’ was confirmed, Greenhouse gas reduction implementation, activation of emission trading market, energy demand management, decentralization of energy, conflict adjustment, reduction of nuclear and coal-fired power plants, and expansion of renewable energy generation proportion are basic directions and contents for energy transition included in the third Green Growth Five-Year Plan, the third Basic Plan for Energy, the eighth Master plan for Electricity Supply and Demand.Despite the establishment of a preemptive energy transition policy in the early stages of the current government, there were many opinions that the public's perception of energy transition through surveys was lower than expected, and it also said the government's implementation of energy transition was insufficient. The issues related to the energy transition policy include weakening the driving force of the decarbonization policy that occurred due to identification of energy transition with ‘abolition of nuclear power plants’, conflict with existing power generation companies centered on the nuclear power industry, and insufficient energy transition system focused on renewable energy, concerns about the reorganization of electricity rates and the dependence of local economies on support systems around the power plant area.Through the limitations and issues of the energy transition policy discussed above, this study suggested the following alternatives: First, it is necessary to clearly set the goal of the energy transition policy to ‘decarbonization’ and to specifically set the implementation measures accordingly; Second, various plans related to energy transition such as Green Growth Plan, Energy Transition Roadmap, Basic Energy Plan, Master Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand, Basic Plan for New and Renewable energy, and Implementation Plan for Renewable Energy 3020 are systematically reorganized and implemented in accordance with the direction of the basic plans; Third, the legal system should be first developed between the current laws such as the Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth and the Energy Act and the Sustainable Development Act, and laws and enforcement decrees should be devised to solve realistic problems, such as climate change mitigation, expansive acceptance of renewable energy, and technology and industry development related to new and renewable energy; Fourth, it is necessary to reorganize the support project for the area around the power plant that focuses on the subsidy at the beginning of construction and gradually decreases the support rate over time, within the scope of that period, taking into account the life of the power plant. In addition, it is desirable to significantly reduce support projects by operators, which increase with the operation of the power plant."

Adaptive expertise enables teachers to envisage pedagogical changes in future class and adapt or improve their teaching approaches and methods. During the fall semester of 2019, nine groups of twenty-six pre-service teachers participated in a series of lectures and workshops and developed two types of English chatbots, each targeting either 3-4 graders or 5-6 graders at primary school. Before and after the implementation of the curriculum, a questionnaire was conducted to examine their adaptive expertise in terms of knowledge, practice, attitude, and willingness. Results indicated that the curriculum was beneficial to their knowledge of, practice in, and attitude to AI chatbot technology for English education, but less effective in reinforcing their willingness to use the AI technology. The effects of the curriculum were further evaluated by the SAMR model (substitution, augmentation, modification, and redefinition), which encompasses multiple levels of pedagogical application of new technology (Puentedura, 2013), and it was found that the curriculum not only enhanced but also transformed learning experiences of the pre-service teachers. These findings lead us to suggest several implications for future research and curriculum design."
이미지 스키마를 통한 한국어 조사 ‘에’와 ‘에서’의 인지언어학적 의미 분석,2020,"['Linguistic Motivation', 'Schematic Meaning', 'Conceptualization', 'Image Schemas', 'Cognitive Model', '언어적 동기', '스키마 의미', '개념화', '이미지 스키마', '인지 모형']",,"The purpose of this dissertation is to extract the schematic meanings of the Korean particles ‘e’ (‘에’) and ‘eseo’ (‘에서’), which are used to express various spatial relations, from the cognitive linguistic perspective. Ultimately, this dissertation aims to identify the linguistic motivation of grammatical forms, i.e., why or when they are used. The schematic meaning, or the base meaning, refers to the conceptual, context-free, single, common, and underlying meaning. The scope of the research is restricted to cases wherein forms are used to express a physical space, which exclude the discussion of the semantic extension process.Despite existing literature on the cognitive linguistic perspective that discussed the schematic meaning from various approaches and wherein the image schema is introduced as an analysis tool, there remains a lack of understanding of the commonality inherent in the multiple meanings of each form and the relatedness among them.To address this issue, first, there should be a shift from the present segmental dictionary view of thinking that focuses on the specificity of meaning, i.e., distinct meanings of each form. In most cases, distinct meanings and their image schemas are simply enumerated. However, from the encyclopedic view, it is natural that distinct meanings differ in consideration of various factors/variables. And it turned out that those senses (physical spaces) are members of a category with equal status. Also, many studies implied that there is a continuity between the phases of our movement; however, the image schemas of each particle tend to be presented separately, not in integrated ways. To be specific, a study from the structural linguistic approach successfully extracted the base meaning of ‘eseo’ but was not able to describe the schematization, or the process of extracting a unified concept from distinct meanings. Second, methods introduced in the analyses of image schemas should be examined. Although it is critical to apply image schema transformations, strict enforcement of such was not required in the analyses. Consequently, it became impossible to describe the natural continuity of movement.To accomplish these two tasks, this study focused on the generality of meaning and performed research at a more general level. The schema or thoughts shared by the Korean language community, as reflected in the two forms, were described. Moreover, the process of how various spatial relations are perceived, construed, and structured during conceptualization was delineated, based on the notion that meaning is equated with conceptualization and that the meaning is a construal of the conceptualizer.As a first step, people’s physical daily movements and some natural phenomena that are relative to the two particles were postulated. From an encyclopedic view, there should be a common, recurring structure(a structure of sensory-motor experience) manifested in seemingly different events. This study argues that the conceptualizer recognizes a trajector (TR) that consists of the phases of approaching–contacting–entering–settling–pause/standstill and the END point in the phenomenon associated with ‘e,’ and another TR that consists of the phases of interior activity–exiting–separating–withdrawing and the START point in the phenomenon associated with ‘eseo.’ To determine the validity of the assumptions, image schemas that are abstract and conceptual representations stored in the mind were presented by context. In particular, by strictly applying image transformations and showing integrated image schemas, this study graphically and clearly showed the continuity between the motion schema PATH·GOAL(Inbound Path) and the static state in the landmark(LM), and the dynamic state in the LM and the motion schema SOURCE-PATH(Outbound Path), and a cessation between the two TRs/trajectories. It argued that the conceptualizer construes that the TR finally pauses..."

When ""Hometown"" was serialized, the KAPF fiercely argued over the issue of socialist realism. Im Hwa, in favor of accepting socialist realism, tried to establish ""hometown"" as a work that realized socialist realism. Therefore, many studies started from the premise that “hometown” is typical of socialist realism based on the literary interpretation of Im Hwa. However, Lee Ki-Young, the creator of ""Hometown"", understood socialism realism as a problem of creative technology and partisanity, and conceptualized art as an independent domain parallel to socialist realism. Starting from Lee Ki-Young's awareness of this problem, this paper clarified the continuity between his previous work, “Soehwa” and “Hometown”, in terms of the creation of practical intellectuals. Lee Ki-Young's works were shabby and repeated the cliché of intellectuals returning home. For him, the most important thing was to present the figure of a pragmatic intellectual beyond that of a abject intellectual. Seohwa prepares for new changes in colonized rural society through the intervention of intellectuals who are more active and transformative than ever before. ""Hometown"" actively suggests what these intellectuals have done to transform rural societies. Unlike many evaluations, despite the fact that ""hometown"" is a very long feature, it proceeds in two themes: love and tenancy. In particular, love is used as a device for the growth of intellectuals, resulting in the marginalization of subjects other than intellectuals. Looking closely at this point, this work finds that the political unconsciousness of the artist who tries to call the negative passions that crush his existence with the passion for revolution is strong. This paper not only examines the gap between Lee Ki-Young's political unconsciousness and KAPF's ideology through the analysis of ""hometown"", but also suggests that the singularity of the artist, which is not reduced to this political ideology, should be presented as a standard of new interpretation."

LWT Based ANN with Ant Lion Optimizer for Detection and Classifcation of High Impedance Faults in Distribution System,2020,['PSD · HIF · Artifcial neural network · Ant lion optimizer · Lifting wavelet transform · Voltage · Current'],,"In this paper, the proposed wavelet-based methodology is developed to identify and classify the High Impedance Fault (HIF) in the Power Distribution System (PDS). The planned technique is based on the combination of Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) and Artifcial Neural Network (ANN), which is performed to accurately isolate the HIF. The change in phase current waveforms caused by faults and normal switching events has been used in this methodology. In order to develop the method to detect high impedance arcing faults under the linear conditions. The faults are identifed through the computation of the basic electric descriptions of current and voltage signals. From the voltage and current signals, the harmonic components also computed. From the voltage, current signals, the fault are identifed and classifed in the system which can be able to solve the problem in the system. The harmonics level also analyzed which also detected and able to correct it for enabling the stable operation in the system. ANN is an Artifcial Intelligence (AI) method that applied for optimizing precise generation limits as blocking happened. The neural network contains two stages: training stage and testing stage. Here, the ALO algorithm is utilized to improve the performance of the ANN training process. ALO is a new nature-inspired algorithm mimicking the hunting behavior of ant lions. The design of Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT) is suitable for the classifcation process. The main objective of ANN with the aid of the ALO algorithm is the detection and classifcation of the HIF in PDS and analyzed the delay time of diferent locations. From the evaluation of the proposed technique, the inputs and their corresponding outputs are noted. The performance of the work is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink platform and the presentation of this model is investigated on the basis of the two cases of analysis. The results show that the projected algorithm detects the HIFs accurately and compared with the existing methods ALO, GSA and ANN, and GA and Fuzzy, respectively."

The church should stick to the immutable value of the gospel, but accommodate according to the culture and time it lives in. Most of this responsibility lies upon the shoulder of church leaders. At this time, it is important to set up a new model for Christian leadership.

Third, leadership must help the church become a beacon of hope by finding a platform for virtual communication in order to cultivate a healthy community."
Energy Efficiency Maximization for Energy Harvesting Bidirectional Cooperative Sensor Networks with AF Mode,2020,"['Cooperative sensor network', 'energy efficiency', 'power splitting protocol', 'time switching protocol', 'amplify-and-forward relay']",,"This paper investigates the energy efficiency of energy harvesting (EH) bidirectional cooperative sensor networks, in which the considered system model enables the uplink information transmission from the sensor (SN) to access point (AP) and the energy supply for the amplify-and-forward (AF) relay and SN using power-splitting (PS) or time-switching (TS) protocol. Considering the minimum EH activation constraint and quality of service (QoS) requirement, energy efficiency is maximized by jointly optimizing the resource division ratio and transmission power. To cope with the non-convexity of the optimizations, we propose the low complexity iterative algorithm based on fractional programming and alternative search method (FAS). The key idea of the proposed algorithm first transforms the objective function into the parameterized polynomial subtractive form. Then we decompose the optimization into two convex sub-problems, which can be solved by conventional convex programming. Simulation results validate that the proposed schemes have better output performance and the iterative algorithm has a fast convergence rate."

Although some educational reforms were introduced in those provinces which the native force of local notables was institutionalized with the implementation of local autonomy, the polarization of urban and rural areas was deepened. In this circumstance, the rural education emerged which originated from the thought of ‘Saving the country by education’ during the May 4th New Culture Movement. For the intellectuals who studied abroad in Western Europe, the backwardness of China's rural education was a key factor that hindered the development of the entire community. They believed that education could steer economic development in rural areas and further enhanced the autonomous ability of farmers to participate in political organizations. Among those Do Haeng-ji advocated the training of teachers as farmer-oriented Intellectuals, which influenced Yang Su-myeong and Liu Pae-hon’s rural construction movement. On the other hand, An yangcho established the People's Education Promotion Association of China to promote the education of the common people as the basis of rural reconstruction, which received general supports from the various levels of governments. Yang Su-myeong didn’t exclude modern science and technology, but reiterated the importance of ethical education based on Confucianism, while the People’s Education Promotion Association of China affirmed that the spread of modern knowledge and technology would bring about the improvement of the rural economy.Through the Rural Rehabilitation Committee and the domestic conference, the rural construction developed individually in each region became the government’s initiative to integrate stratified sub-regime. With the financial, human and administrative support from the government, the effective rural construction movement progressed. However the two fundamental problems of the rural community, land tenure system and rent, and the actual development of local autonomy were remained in the theoretical debates.In particular, the progress of rural construction was depended upon the relationship between the local government and the influential class and the central government, and the rural construction movement was also affected by the conflict between these forces.In the process of creating a nation-state, it was the role of intellectuals by presenting the model of social integration through education which was adopted by each local government and the Nanjing government. In addition, the process of integrating rural community through mediation of conflict was closely related to the role of intellectuals and the function of the social integration mechanism of education. It was a historical meaning of rural construction movement."

By the 1890s, Java emerged as the world second largest producer of raw sugar, while refineries in Hong Kong processed it and sold their refined sugar to Asian market, mainly to China and Japan. Sugar industrial capital in Java and Hong Kong could develop by exploiting the so-called free markets in China and Japan, which lost tariff sovereignty under the unequal treaty system. Unlike typical vertical structure of western sugar industry connecting colony raw sugar and home refineries, Java and Hong Kong sugar capital dominated the Asian sugar market through international business partnership mainly targeting the Asian internal market. This can be said to be the most distinctive feature of sugar market in the Modern East Asia. Besides, sugar refineries of Hong Kong were built by Jardine, Matheson & Co. and Butterfield & Swire Co., representative transnational British merchants. However, once Japan regained its tariff sovereignty, Japan introduced a vertical structure of the western model to establish sugar refineries in home Japan with using raw sugar in Taiwan colony in combination with securing the protective tariff and fiscal subsides. Japanese rising sugar industry led to reduce free market of Asia to China and India. The free market in Japan has been wiped out by economic protectionism. In China, the Hong Kong sugar capital, which advocated free trade, had to compete unfairly with the Japanese sugar, which enjoyed protective domestic market and high export subsidies. With China’s nationalism erupting in the wake of 1925, the Hong Kong sugar industry suffered a decisive blow in the Chinese market."

In the history, Hai-Rui was a scholar-official of integrity who did not chase power. He lived a temperate life maintaining self-frugality, and was considered an official who loved the nation as his own children. Hai-Rui gradually appeared as a fictitious character in a variety of literary texts and his existence was added with exaggerated descriptions and settled as a model of an official of integrity. In particular, he was one of the key figures encouraging the realm of “Gong-An Novel” to grow into a universal reading pattern.In the modern time, after going through the history of vicissitude that had been collapsed in the political and ideological sense, his presence started to attract attention not only in historical values as an official of integrity and literary reality but also in possibilities of creation as diverse modern cultural contents. In particular, despite his rigid figure image as an official of integrity, the fact that there is an effort of searching for a point of contact to communicate even with the modern-day people with various cultural desires of consumption seems to demonstrate that the wish of people towards “officials of integrity” is deeply situated on the base, regardless of time.Hai-Rui manifests his image as an official of integrity and a model of ideal human figure desired by people in not only the time in which he lived but also today, and he settles as a figure of the history with which we enjoy beyond the barrier of time."

A new model of writing education was created based on the cognitive process which involves responding to stimuli of objects with five senses - integrating sensory information with previous experiences to establish an objective and detailed recognition framework, - subjectively conceptualizing the perception, cause, and judgment. In particular, the study highlights the following concepts : ① To absorb an object with all five senses ② To make an emotional communion with an object in various contact methods ③ To draw out previous experiences and integrate with current experiences in order to exercise imagination and creativity ④ To connect and newly conceptualize the essence of object and the essence of ‘I’ and the nature of life by putting I into the object. Accordingly, the study involves the following stages : ① The Sensory stage : conducting ‘sensory reaction training’ → ‘activate five senses’ ② The Detection stage : writing a sensory response diary. ③ The Perception stage : splitting into a small group of three to four members to practice ‘finding sensory search terms and sensory descriptive terms’ → ‘sharing the story of experiences’ ④ The Cognition stage : ‘dialoguing with objects’ → ‘categorize the properties of objects’ → ‘imagine ‘I’ become an object and make a description in the first point of view’ → ‘a few moments of quite meditation’ ⑤ The Writing stage : using landscape photos containing various objects, writing practice incorporating the cognition process was conducted ⑥ The Final stage : stating one’s impression in writing after finish writing practice. The writing in pursuit of cognitive process is an effective way that can restore modern peoples brains, which are transforming into the reptile brains nowaday, but also modern peoples lives into a decent human life. After completing the writing in pursuit of cognitive process, students have stated following thoughts behind: ‘insight into the appearance and properties of objects’·‘fe ling of being one with objects through communion’·‘fe ling of positively changed mind and widen views’·‘had a chance of improving myself’·‘a lot of things to express and hold.’ In conclusion, the writing in pursuit of cognitive process reminds us once again what the equation of life = writing signifies, and the equation of life = writing is the truth that penetrates the nature of life and the nature of writing."

Therefore, in this study, the characteristics of augmented reality were presented separately as perceived realism, interaction, pleasure, and usability, and the influence of augmented reality by immersion parameters on the user s satisfaction and intended to reveal the relationship between satisfaction and usage through the characteristics of augmented reality. For the purpose of this study, a structured questionnaire was conducted, and the available 209 responses were collected and used for empirical analysis. The results of the empirical analysis are as follows. First, while immersion has the greatest effect on satisfaction, the effect on use intention has a stronger effect on satisfaction than immersion. This indicates that purchase occurs when the user s immersion leads to satisfaction, and when the satisfaction falls, the intention to use is also lowered. Second, interactivity, enjoyment, and ease of use among the various characteristics of fashion applications have a positive effect on immersion. Among them, ease of use had a strong effect on immersion. In light of this, it can be seen that ease of use should be considered first when creating an application based on augmented reality in the future fashion industry. However, the perceived reality is low in the degree of immersion, and the effect on satisfaction is also lowered, so it is difficult to be connected to intention. Considering that this study was conducted through indirect experience through video viewing, this study expects the development of research through a more practical research model in the future, as the impact is considered to be a relatively low measurement."

This period is characterized by the efforts to provide equal opportunities of work for both genders, as the social reproduction based on the male breadwinner model reached the limit and the social discourse on the gender relations and patriarchal social norms were most active in the same period.Two analytic strategies were adopted. Firstly, writings on the male contributors' section on a renowned women's movement group's newsletter were analyzed in order to look into the microscopic features of how personal lives are articulated to the historical changes. The column section, titled ""Men Talk About Aging"", appears in the newsletter of Women's Association for a Better Aging Society, founded in 1983. One hundred contributions from the years between 1987 and 2001 were covered in this analysis, showing the changes in the gender norms and perceptions of men in the same period.Secondly, I proposed some criteria to classify the periods according to the features of male gender norms, by combining the columns with the data covering macroscopic social changes. The first period around the year 1980 is characterized by the challenges faced by the ‘sarari man (salaried man)’ who had represented the postwar Japanese society for their male ego. Wet fallen leaves and big trash were the metaphors presented in this period, calling for the men to change themselves, although they were resisted against by men themselves. In the 1990s, the calls for the change got intensified and became a matter of social concerns as the bubble economy clashed, and the family-enterprise regime, which was based upon a sexual division of labor, collapsed from the inside. The diverse fields of discourse and social activist groups relevant to this change will be highlighted in the analysis. The third period, the 2000s, saw a backlash in gender politics and the retreat of the vision of reformation in the 1990s. It will be shown in the analysis how this failure of reformation affected the Japanese men's incorporation into the hyper aging society, and how this social context influenced the caring masculinity of ‘men the carer’ recently appeared in the Japanese society."

The research method here is to analyze three types of shaman costume classified by Holmberg, which are bird-type, deer-type, and bear-type, through theoretical research and to investigate the analysis process of Roland Barthes’s semiotics theory. Roland Barthes’s approach to semiotics presents an analysis model that can explore the sociocultural meaning of the Siberian shaman costume. The research results are as follows. In the first type, to be closer to the god of the upperworld, shamans transform themselves into birds by decorating their costumes with the characteristic elements of birds such as feathers and wings. In the second type, the shamans’ costumes are made of deerskin, and the headdress is shown in the shape of antlers to make it easier to receive messages from the upperworld and run fast in the underworld. In the third type, the shaman’s costume is made of bearskin, the head is covered with bearskin, and the body is decorated with bear pendants.

Effect of length scale parameters on transversely isotropic thermoelastic medium using new modified couple stress theory,2020,"['new modified couple stress theory', 'length scale parameters', 'transversely isotropic', 'ramp type heat', 'Laplace and Fourier transform']",,"The objective of this paper is to study the deformation in transversely isotropic thermoelastic solid using new modified couple stress theory subjected to ramp-type thermal source and without energy dissipation. This theory contains three material length scale parameters which can determine the size effects. The couple stress constitutive relationships are introduced for transversely isotropic thermoelastic solid, in which the curvature (rotation gradient) tensor is asymmetric and the couple stress moment tensor is symmetric. Laplace and Fourier transform technique is applied to obtain the solutions of the governing equations. The displacement components, stress components, temperature change and couple stress are obtained in the transformed domain. A numerical inversion technique has been used to obtain the solutions in the physical domain. The effects of length scale parameters are depicted graphically on the resulted quantities. Numerical results show that the proposed model can capture the scale effects of microstructures."

This year, the Ministry of Personnel Management announced the “2020 Work Innovation Guidelines”, which mainly include the creation of working conditions where work, life, and quarantine coexist, to promote non-face-to-face and non-contact work. Reflecting this reality, this study used the “2018 Public Employees’ Perception Survey” data from the Korea Administrative Research Institute to identify the leading and consequential factors of the satisfaction of Korean public employees’ smart work (smart work centers, video conferences, and flexible work systems). Through PLS structural equation model analysis, we analyze the impact of innovative culture, transformational leadership in an organization on smart work satisfaction, as well as the impact of smart work satisfaction on entrepreneurship and quality of life. Besides, we looked at the moderating effects of collaboration/communication and overwork, respectively, in terms of the impact of smart work satisfaction on entrepreneurship and quality of life. The analysis demonstrates that the positive effects of transformational leadership and innovative culture on smart work satisfaction are significant only for certain smart work types, while the positive effects on entrepreneurship and quality of life are significant for all the smart work types. On the other hand, it also reveals that collaboration/communication has a significant moderating effect in the relationship between smart work satisfaction and entrepreneurship. This study is expected to provide a set of practical implications and caveats to public managers and practitioners as well as make a theoretical contribution to public administration research from a public human resources management perspective."
System simulation and synchronization for optimal evolutionary design of nonlinear controlled systems,2020,"['system simulation and synchronization', 'fuzzy relaxed system', 'intelligent algorithm']",,"Due to the influence of nonlinearity and time-variation, it is difficult to establish an accurate model of concrete frame structures that adopt active controllers. Fuzzy theory is a relatively appropriate method but susceptible to human subjective experience to decrease the performance. This paper proposes a novel artificial intelligence based EBA (Evolved Bat Algorithm) controller with machine learning matched membership functions in the complex nonlinear system. The proposed affine transformed membership functions are adopted and stabilization and performance criterion of the closed-loop fuzzy systems are obtained through a new parametrized linear matrix inequality which is rearranged by machine learning affine matched membership functions. The trajectory of the closed-loop dithered system and that of the closed-loop fuzzy relaxed system can be made as close as desired. This enables us to get a rigorous prediction of stability of the closed-loop dithered system by establishing that of the closed-loop fuzzy relaxed system."

The novel nNFIB was produced using planetary mono mill and characterized. Equilibrium and kinetics studies of Cu sorption by nNFIB were performed in batch system. The effects of a variety of factors, including pH, coexisting ions and adsorption time on Cu adsorption were investigated. Furthermore, Cu sequestration mechanism onto nNFIB was investigated using sequential extraction technique and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra before and after nNFIB adsorption. The Cu sorption equilibrium and kinetics data were successfully described by Langmuir and first-order models, respectively. The calculated maximum Cu(II) adsorption capacity (qmax) of nNFIB (100 mg g−1) was four times higher than qmax of bulk NFIB. Copper removal by nNFIB was quite fast (around 86%) in the first 5 min and gradually slowed down until achieved 100% removal at equilibrium time. The FTIR spectra and Cu fractionation data in biosolid-amended soil demonstrated that Cu sequestration in contaminated water and soil is strongly related to CaCO₃ of nNFIB. The overall findings show the potential use of nNFIB as a best management practice for Cu removal from wastewater and Cu stabilization in contaminated biosolid-amended soils."

Supercritical bifurcation to periodic melt fracture as the 1st transition to 2D elastic flow instability,2020,"['high Deborah number', 'bifurcation', 'viscoelasticity', 'melt fracture']",,"This study, employing a numerical approximation, computationally describes 2D melt fracture as elastic instability in the flow along and outside a straight channel. In the preceding research (Kwon, 2018, Numerical modeling of two-dimensional melt fracture instability in viscoelastic flow, J. Fluid Mech. 855, 595-615) several types of unique instability and corresponding bifurcations such as subcritical and chaotic transitions have been illustrated with possible mechanism presumed. However, the 1st bifurcation from stable steady to unstable periodic state could not be accurately characterized even though its existence was proven evident. The analysis herein aims at verification of this 1st transition to temporally (and also spatially) periodic instability, utilizing the same numerical technique with attentive control of flow condition. As a result of scrutinizing the solutions, the steady elastic flow described by the Leonov rheological model passes through supercritical Hopf bifurcation at the Deborah number of 10.42 and then transforms to the state of the 1st weak periodic instability. It has also been confirmed that near this bifurcation point it takes extremely long to completely develop into either steady state (in the stable case) or periodic instability, which obstructed immediate characterization of the transition in the previous work."

The geopolymerization process transformed the sphericalfly ash particles into a porous andamorphous polymeric structure, sodium-alumina-silicate hydrate gel. The removal efficiency increasedwith the geopolymer dosage while it decreased with BY2 concentration. Specifically, the efficiency of94.47% was achieved with the geopolymer dosage of 2.0 g L-1. However, further increases resulted in asubstantial reduction, down to 57.76% for 3.0 g L-1. At 293 K for 300 min, the efficiency decreased from84.69 to 64.19% for BY2 concentrations of 10 and 50 mg L-1, respectively. Based on the isothermal, kineticand thermodynamic investigations of the adsorption process, the Langmuir and Temkin models wellcorrelated with the obtained results. The adsorption occurs spontaneously and shows endothermiccharacter. The pseudo-second order and the intra-particle diffusion models are valid for 293 K while theadsorption results well suited with the pseudo-second order for 313 and 323 K.

Short‑Term Load Forecasting Method Based on EWT and IDBSCAN,2020,['EMD · IDBSCAN · Load forecasting · LSTM'],,"Accurate load forecasting is of great signifcance to the safety and stability of power grid operation. This paper proposes a combined prediction method based on empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (IDBSCAN). The EWT is used to decompose the load to obtain various intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, each IMF is predicted with a rational method. The low frequency and intermediate frequency components are predicted by long short-term memory (LSTM). High frequency components have uncertain characteristics. Therefore, they are clustered by IDBSCAN, according to meteorological factors. The processing model is selected based on the characteristics of each class sample. Finally, the prediction results of each component are superimposed to obtain the total prediction result. Experiments are conducted based on the measured load data of a Chinese city. A comparison between the proposed method, EWT–LSTM, EWT-Elman, and empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-LSTM is made. The results indicate that the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy and refects the randomness of the actual load."

To date, however, research on louver design through daylight simulation and analysis of data is found to be insufficient, considering the design intent of the building from an architect’s or designer’ perspective. The purpose of this study is to recognize the problem of interior space due to excessive daylight, to examine the progress of the design through the analysis of the simulations carried out to solve these problems, and to consider what the architect should consider in the simulation process. Method: Atrium space at the top of the tower where problems are expected to be caused by excessive daylight has been chosen as the simulation location for this study. For the progress of study, the methods of analyzing data, along with the concept of daylight simulation models, Constant Daylight Autonomy (cDA) and the Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI), are understood through examples. Parametric models are built through Rhino and Grasshopper, and daylight simulations are carried out through Ladybug and Honeybee, the plug-in of Grasshopper, and the results are analyzed. Result: This study is meaningful in terms of a process to automatically execute and store results for different alternatives generated by parameters set up in conjunction with parametric tools in the initial design process. In addition, this study will provide useful information to architects or students who want to design the daylight to fit the architect’s design intent, as well as understanding the overall trend and evolutionary digital tools, as well as providing useful information about the lighting simulation process, how data is interpreted, and what needs to be considered in the simulation."

In the meantimes, Flipped learning is the landmark for transforming college instructional change in many universities.But, Flipped learning instructors depend on the traditional instructional design and implementation strategy not a suitable model for innovative(student-based) teaching practice and competency education. Researcher designed this research for designing instructional strategy specific to flipped learning proposed by Talbert in 2016. He proposed that effective flipped learning environments require four ingredients: ① structure(backward design), ② rich resources, ③ engagement(zone of proximal development), and ④ communication(such as assessment, formal evaluation, and human­human discourse).

Firstly, a prescribed performance transformation function is constructed to equivalently release the output error constraints. Then, a coordinated controller is designed to complete lateral and longitudinal motion control tasks simultaneously based on sliding-mode control. The designed coordinated controller can guarantee predefined trajectory tracking performance (e.g., minimum speed of convergence, maximum steady state error and overshoot), in presence of strongcoupled characteristics, model uncertainties and external disturbance. Finally, simulation results under different boundary constraints further validate the feasibility and good robustness of the controller."
PACTE법률 제정에 따른 프랑스 특허제도의 변화,2020,"['PACTE Act', 'Utility certificate', 'Patent opposition proceedings', 'Patent Invalidation', 'Prescription period', 'PACTE법', '실용신안', '특허이의신청', '특허무효', '시효']",,"In the context of economic reform of the Macron government, the law relating to the Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation of Companies(“PACTE Act”) was promulgated on May 23, 2019 in France. Particularly, the PACTE Act deals with points relating to patents in its articles 118 and 121 to 124. One of the most important measures of the PACTE Act regarding patent system is strengthening of examination of patent applications by the French Industrial Property Office(Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle, INPI). Before the PACTE Act, the INPI’s examination was limited to a assessment of certain substantive grounds (i.e., absence of patentability, lack of novelty). Such defects had to be “manifest” in the opinion of the examiner. In addition, the criteria of inventive step and industrial application were not even considered. PACTE Act strengthens the INPI’s examination by allowing the INPI to reject a patent application for lack of novelty, lack of inventive step or lack of industrial application. Along with these changes in the patent system, the PACTE Act also brought about modernization of the utility certificate system. The duration of the utility certificate increases from 6 years to 10 years, and the possibility of transforming an application for a utility certificate into a patent application. Prior to the PACTE Act, only patent applications could be converted into utility model applications; the reverse was impossible. Another important measure of the PACTE Act is the introduction of opposition proceedings to French patents before the INPI. Until now, the invalidity of a French patent can only be challenged before French courts. This new administrative opposition procedure will make it possible to obtain either the revocation of a French patent outside the courts. Finally, the PACTE Act also provides that invalidation actions against industrial property titles are not time-barred, namely, no prescription period for patent invalidation actions. We can say for sure that these changes will have a substantial impact on practice at the INPI, in particular with regard to the granting of French patents, which will certainly be complicated. The details of these changes were delegated to subordinate legislation. We will therefore need to closely watch the subsequent implementation of new legislation."

Secondly, a sufficient condition for ensuring the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system and the existence of the robust guaranteed cost controller is given according to the Lyapunov stability theory. Then, this sufficient condition is transformed into a linear matrix inequality form by using Schur complement lemma and the design of robust guaranteed cost controller is realized by the solution of LMI.

Kinematically Exact Inverse-Simulation Techniques with Applications to Rotorcraft Aggressive-Maneuver Analyses,2020,"['Inverse simulation', 'Aggressive maneuver', 'Pseudo-spectral method', 'Quasi-Newton method', 'Fixed-point iterative method']",,"An inverse-simulation problem is reformulated to exactly satisfy the kinematic constraints imposed by the prescribed trajectory. Thereby, the problem can be transformed into an index 1 differential–algebraic equation that is much more easily solvable than the higher index system of the conventional formulation. Various numerical methods which have been successfully used in the pseudo-spectral inverse-simulation techniques are adopted with some modifications to efficiently solve the resultant system. The paper proposes a formal algorithm to describe the detailed solution process. The algorithm is applied to the analyses of the vertical, slalom, and helical-turn maneuvers of Bo-105. The simulation results with both the conventional and present formulations are compared to show the numerical features of the present methods. Effects of the solution-control parameters, the aggressiveness level of a maneuver, the quality of the prescribed trajectory, and the fidelity level of the math model are thoroughly investigated. The results of applications show that the proposed algorithm is extremely robust in that solution convergence is less sensitive to the maneuver aggressiveness, the quality of the generated trajectory, and the solution-control parameters. Therefore, it can be concluded that the kinematically exact inverse-simulation techniques deserve to be a one of the promising inverse-simulation methods like the pseudo-spectral inverse-simulation techniques."

It will fundamentally change industry, economy, and business models through technological innovations, such as big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and 3D printing. In particular, the development of highly advanced information technology (IT) and AI is expected to replace human roles, thereby changing employment and occupation prospects in the future. Based on this, some predict that the profession of the pharmacist will soon disappear. To counter this, pharmacists’ attention and efforts are required to seek innovative transformations in their functions by responding sensitively and promptly to changes of the fourth industrial revolution. It is also necessary to recognize the new roles of pharmacists and to develop the competencies to perform them. The fourth industrial revolution is an inevitable change of the times. At this time, we should take comprehensive and open perspectives on how the future society will change economically, culturally, and socially, and use it as an opportunity to shape the new future of pharmacists."

In particular, it became the basis for national economic growth by providing labor to other industries through increased productivity of the agricultural sector. The importance of R&D in the agricultural sector is also being emphasized in preparation for the fourth industrial revolution, which has been highlighted recently. Agricultural R&D is directly related to the fourth industrial revolution in agriculture that utilizes big data, robots, artificial intelligence, and clouds. On the other hand, subsidies are considered the most widely used policy means. These subsidies affect domestic resource allocation, income distribution structure, and expenditure productivity regardless of specific policy areas, and also affect international competitiveness between trade and economic entities.The purpose of this paper is to examine the dynamic analysis of variables by establishing a quantitative model in terms of agricultural environment subsidies that represent the government’s role and agricultural gross agricultural product in light of the importance of R&D investment in Chinese agriculture.In conclusion, the agricultural R&D investment and agricultural environmental subsidies not only have a long-term positive effect on agricultural income, but also increase the agricultural income positively affect the level of agricultural mechanization. In other words, today’s agriculture is transforming into a science and technology-oriented agriculture, unlike the past resource-oriented agriculture, and agricultural technology will act as a catalyst that can replace the scarce resources that are obstacles to agricultural growth with abundant resources."
Keypoints-Based 2D Virtual Try-on Network System,2020,"['Virtual Try-On', 'Image Synthesis', 'Image Warping', 'Human Body Parsing', 'Keypoints Prediction']",,"Image-based Virtual Try-On Systems are among the most potential solution for virtual fitting which tries on a target clothes into a model person image and thus have attracted considerable research efforts. In many cases, current solutions for those fails in achieving naturally looking virtual fitted image where a target clothes is transferred into the body area of a model person of any shape and pose while keeping clothes context like texture, text, logo without distortion and artifacts. In this paper, we propose a new improved image-based virtual try-on network system based on keypoints, which we name as KP-VTON. The proposed KP-VTON first detects keypoints in the target clothes and reliably predicts keypoints in the clothes of a model person image by utilizing a dense human pose estimation. Then, through TPS transformation calculated by utilizing the keypoints as control points, the warped target clothes image, which is matched into the body area for wearing the target clothes, is obtained. Finally, a new try-on module adopting Attention U-Net is applied to handle more detailed synthesis of virtual fitted image. Extensive experiments on a well-known dataset show that the proposed KP-VTON performs better the state-of-the-art virtual try-on systems."

Park Eun-sik, as the best example found on the basis of this interest, created a philosophical framework of the transition of educational civilization in the modern Korean period in a very good form. He was responsible for his life to build a philosophical system necessary to prepare and lead the transition of civilization, and he tried to solve it especially in the education field. This is also confirmed by the fact that the proportion of education in his activities and writings throughout his life is overwhelming. His education theory reached the stage of establishing a new educational philosophical paradigm necessary for the new era, beyond the level of discussing the policy of educational practice in the enlightenment movement or independence movement or religious movement. Based on connecting and harmonization of the East and the West, nationalism and cosmopolitanism, intelligence and virtue, academic and practicality, his philosophy of education discussed the concept of education, the role of school, the principle of curriculum for harmonious cultivation of virtue-intelligence-health, the innovation of people’s minds and lives. In particular, he chose the way to keep an eye on the universal values in Confucianism, not to deny Confucianism while consciously breaking away the Confucian paradigm, and to extract and utilize the Confucian values with those of other thoughts of the East and the West. He has conceived his educational thoughts and system of a new era while comprehensively considering traditional ideas such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Sin-gyo, Seon-gyo and other Western ideas including of Christianity, evolution theory and the successful models of the Western countries. The case of Park Eun-sik shows that the modern times in the history of Korean educational thought is not a blank period but a period when the philosophical framework required for the transition of education civilization is established consciously and systematically."

Control of the phase separation enables the formation of PS particleswith cage- and bowl-like shapes as well as hollow structures. The large surface areas of the complex-structured particles, as theoretically calculated using simple models, and the electrostatic attractionbetween them and the negatively charged noble-metal NPs, as experimentally observed, allow the highimmobilization of noble-metal NPs onto their surfaces."

Also, the critical buckling load increases as the shape increases, with its feather varying depending on the asymmetric initial conditions. Decomposition results show the decrease in predominant frequency before the threshold as the load increases, and the predominant period doubles at the critical level.

Preparation and characterisation of activated carbon from Vitis vinifera leaf litter and its adsorption performance for aqueous phenanthrene,2020,"['Phenanthrene', 'Adsorption', 'Activated carbon', 'Vitis vinifera', 'Biomass']",,"The adsorption of phenanthrene onto activated carbons produced from Vitis vinifera leaf litter (a waste plant biomass) was investigated in this study. Zinc chloride ( ZnCl2) and phosphoric acid ( H3PO4) were utilised as activating agents in producing the activated carbons. The characterisation of the activated carbons was achieved with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (for surface functional groups), scanning electron microscopy (for surface morphology) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) (for surface area determination). The adsorption of phenanthrene onto the activated carbons was optimised in terms of solution pH, adsorbent dosage, initial concentration of adsorbate solution and contact time. Experimental results showed that H3PO4 modified activated carbon gave better yield (up to 58.40%) relative to ZnCl2 modified activated carbon (only up to 47.08%). Meanwhile, surface characterisation showed that ZnCl2 modification resulted in higher BET surface area (up to 616.60 m2/ g) and total pore volume (up to 0.289 cm3/g) relative to BET surface area of up to 295.49 m2/ g and total pore volume of up to 0.185 cm3/g obtained from H3PO4 modified activated carbons. Adsorption equilibrium data fitted well into Freundlich isotherm model relative to other applied isotherm models, with maximum Kf value of 1.27 for ZnCl2 modified activated carbon and 1.16 Kf value for H3PO4 modified activated carbon. The maximum adsorption capacity for ZnCl2 and H3PO4 activated carbons for the removal of phenanthrene were 94.12 and 89.13 mg/g, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that dynamic equilibrium was reached at 80 min contact time. Experimental data fitted best into the Elovich kinetic model relative to other kinetic models, based on the correlation coefficient (R2) values obtained from kinetic studies. Chemisorption was deduced as a major phenanthrene removal pathway from aqueous solution and the physicochemical characteristics of the adsorbents have major influence on phenanthrene removal efficiencies."

We consider four types of compressor models including the normal stage with hub and shroud leakages (SWT), the normal stage with hub leakage (SWH), the normal stage with shroud leakage (SWS), and the normal stage without leakages (SOT)). The results indicate that the leakage flow obviously affects the compressor performance, especially the flow field around the leading/trailing edge of the impeller. The aerodynamic load at the leading/trailing edge of the impeller was obtained for the models through unsteady simulation. The dominant frequency and the pulse amplitude obtained by Fast Fourier transforms revealed that the main frequencies of the aerodynamic load present different distributions under different leakage flows."

The position and orientation of each discrete link of the hyper-redundant manipulator is calculated using a transformation matrix, and the moment equations of the joints are solved by numerical analysis. The shape deformation of the manipulator under a lateral force is calculated and the theoretical stiffness on the lateral force is determined. We compare the stiffness obtained by experiments with theoretical values. The lateral deformation has an error of up to 7.1 mm, and the lateral stiffness is within an error range of 9%. Stiffness analysis of the hyper-redundant manipulator is expected to predict the motion of the manipulator during robotic interventions."
TGF-β1 induces VEGF expression in human granulosa-lutein cells: a potential mechanism for the pathogenesis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome,2020,[],,"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is one of the most serious and iatrogenic complications that can occur during in vitro fertilization treatment. Although the pathogenesis of OHSS is not fully understood, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been recognized as an important mediator of the development of OHSS. Transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-β1) is known to regulate various ovarian functions. However, whether VEGF can be regulated by TGF-β1 in human granulosa cells has not been determined. In addition, the role of TGF-β1 in the pathogenesis of OHSS remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that TGF-β1 stimulates VEGF expression in and secretion from both immortalized human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells and primary hGL cells. Our results demonstrate that the SMAD2/3, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways are involved in TGF-β1-induced VEGF expression and secretion. Using a mouse OHSS model, we show that the expression levels of TGF-β1 and VEGF are increased in the ovaries of OHSS mice. Blocking TGF-β1 signaling inhibits the development of OHSS by attenuating VEGF expression. Moreover, clinical results reveal that the protein levels of TGF-β1 and VEGF are increased in the follicular ﬂuid of patients with OHSS, and that the levels of these two proteins in the follicular ﬂuid are positively correlated. The results of this study help to elucidate the mechanisms by which VEGF expression is regulated in hGL cells, which could lead to the development of alternative therapeutic approaches for treating OHSS."

The governing partial differential equations of the disk model were established and transformed to a series of ordinary differential equations via suitable self-similar transformations, which were solved numerically by the shooting technique coupled with Runge-Kutta scheme and Newton’s method. The Marangoni number related to temperature and concentration was derived, the effects of the magnetic Hartmann number, Marangoni number, radiation number, heat source number and chemical reaction number related to velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles were analyzed. The results demonstrate that the Hartmann number and Marangoni number have significant impacts on the heat and mass transfer of the Marangoni boundary layer flow. The temperature tends to increase with heat generation and decrease with heat absorption, and it exhibits a delay phenomenon for significant heat generation cases. Negative/positive chemical reactions tended to increase/decrease the concentration, similar to the effect of heat generation/absorption on the temperature."

Preparation of nano-sized Mg-doped copper silicate materials using coal gangue as the raw material and its characterization for CO2 adsorption,2020,"['Coal Gangue', 'Mg-doped Copper Silicate', 'CO2', 'Adsorption', 'Thermodynamic Parameters']",,"This work presents a simple method for the preparation of the Mg-doped nanocomposite copper silicates (Mgx-Cu1x-SiO3) (x=0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.9) using coal gangue waste as the silicon source for CO2 capture at low temperature.The as-prepared Mgx-Cu1x-SiO3 was systemically characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis (BET). The results suggest that all Mgx-Cu1x-SiO3 possess large surface areas, micropores and mesoporous structures composed of the agglomerates of small nanoparticles. They exhibit high CO2 adsorption capacity at 298.15 K under 1 bar, and that of Mg0.9-Cu0.1-SiO3 was the highest with the value of 16.73 cm3/g. The Freundlich isotherm model fits the CO2 adsorption isotherm well. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that the CO2 adsorption on Mg0.9-Cu0.1-SiO3 is exothermic (Ho<0), chaotic (So<0), and spontaneous (Go<0).This work highlights the low-temperature adsorption behavior of silicate materials on CO2, which can provide some research basis for the utilization of silica in coal gangue."
Statistical inference of some effect sizes,2020,"['Experimental design', 'Effect size', 'Non-central beta distribution', 'Confidence interval']",,"The reporting of effect sizes in social-scientific articles is becoming increasingly widespread and encouraged, particularly when research and experimental designs are involved.

For each effect size in every experimental design, it is found that the distribution or transformation of distribution belongs to the non-central Beta family.Confidence intervals for effect size in the corresponding hypothesis are obtained by applying the results from the distributions combined with the probability limits.Based on the first two moments of distributions, which lead to the mean and standard deviation, a simulation study is given to help better understand the behaviour of  2 at different sample sizes and group numbers. This provides a reference for choosing sample and group sizes in experimental design.

After sulfonation of watermelon rind, the H/C and O/C ratios improved from 0.046 to 0.13 and 0.662 to 1.28, respectively, According to Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis, the peaks of sulfonic-acid (R-SO<sub>3</sub>H), carboxylic groups, and bonded OH-group were larger in the SWR than that of dried raw watermelon rind samples. In the various parameter studies, 1 g/L adsorbent and a pH 7 were optimal for the adsorption of Pb(II) onto SWR. Moreover, the adsorption kinetics and isothermal adsorption were well described by Pseudo-2nd-order and Langmuir models, respectively. The maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity and 1/n values were determined 104.2 mg/g and 0.14, respectively, indicating that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto SWR could occur easily in aqueous solution. In addition, the negative values of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and enthalpy (ΔH) in thermodynamic study were obtained, indicating that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto SWR was spontaneous in nature and that it represented an exothermic reaction. We conclude that SWRs, which are obtainable from agricultural waste, can be effectively used as bio-adsorbent to remove Pb(II) from aqueous solutions."

Al/nanoclay was applied as an efficient superadsorbent to remove Direct Red 23 (DR23) from colored wastewater. The adsorbent was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy, and zeta potential analysis. The effects of various operating parameters, such as contact time, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dose, pH and ionic strength on the performance of adsorption, have been studied. The adsorption experiments showed that pH has an obvious effect on the adsorption efficiency and the highest percentage of DR23 dye removal was observed at pH 2. Zeta potential measurement confirmed that the adsorption mechanism is ascribed to electrostatic interaction between sulfonic groups of the anionic dye and the positive surface charge of the adsorbent. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm were found to best describe the DR23 adsorption and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity at the conditions of pH 2 and the adsorbent dose of 0.05 g/L was 2,500mg/g.

By introducingauxiliary variables and the Bergman distance, the original problem is transformed into an iterative solution oftwo simple sub-problems, which greatly reduces the computational complexity. Experiments using standardimages show that the split-based Bergman iterative algorithm in hybrid domain defeats the traditional Waveletsframework or curvelets framework both in terms of timeliness and recovery accuracy, which demonstrates thevalidity of the model and algorithm in this paper."

Literacy is a vital area of life that has been creating gaps during the information age. The policy of reading welfare was enacted in view of selected aspects of welfare, but we should attend to the fact that literacy events have a variety of values for universal welfare. Thus, this study seeks to find an alternative modern literacy education model that concentrates on the effectiveness and management of learning. People who are able to read can establish an imagined vision about themselves and the world through the transformation of linguistic turn. Therefore, the reader should be at the center of literacy education. Literacy was recognized not only as a fixed skill set but also as a capability of readers, which refers to what readers would do as well as who would do it. According to the approach of new literacy, which concentrates on the social and cultural character of literacy, the reading gap results from linguistic differences and tensions between first discourse (family or peer group) and second discourse (school, social, or public sphere). In particular, a peripheral student experiences the tension and conflict between family discourse and school discourse. The main goal of reader-centered literacy education for reading welfare comprises six items: 1) tolerance, 2) social-emotional well-being, 3) authentic practice, 4) connectivity, 5) diversity, and 6) convergence. This study suggests that there are five tasks suitable for related practice. First, it is necessary to utilize literacy skills in multiple practical contexts in school-based literacy education. Second, it is necessary to develop various models of readers that represent the actual image of readers in addition to the ideal image. Third, the teacher should use classroom conversations for building a tolerant learning community that eliminates discrimination and social prejudice against the practical group. Fourth, it is necessary to design a culturally responsive fusion literacy curriculum that integrates the living culture of the reader into the classroom. Fifth, it is necessary to prepare human and social infrastructure to achieve actual effectiveness for a welfare policy."

In this paper, to account for the channel uncertainties, a robust power allocation scheme for a downlink Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) heterogeneous network (HetNet) is designed to maximize energy efficiency (EE), which can ensure the quality of service (QoS) of users. We conduct the robust optimization model based on worse-case method, in which the channel gains belong to certain ellipsoid sets. To solve the non-convex non-liner optimization , we transform the optimization problem via Dinkelbach method and sequential convex programming, and the power allocation of small cell users (SCUs) is achieved by Lagrange dual approach. Finally, we analysis the convergence performance of proposed scheme. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve total EE of SCUs, and has a fast convergence performance."

Spatial miss-match is different in the metropolitan cities and other metropolitan cities in Korea. Seoul and other metropolitan cities have grown to become centers of business functions, while other metropolitan cities have been transformed into residential function centers. Accordingly, The reverse commuting phenomenon is occurring in the rural metropolitan. The reverse commuting phenomenon limits the employment opportunities of specific classes among urban residents, and cause various problems such as environmental pollution and traffic congestion. Therefore, many studies on spatial mismatch and reverse commuting have been conducted, but a number of studies have been conducted on the Seoul metropolitan area, and research on other metropolitan areas is insufficient. The purpose of this study is to analyze the cause of the commuting phenomenon in the metropolitan area of ​​the non-metropolitan area by considering spatial mismatch and understanding the reverse commutation situation in the local metropolitan area. This study is analyzed by a multi-level model and suggests the need for management of industrial location and expansion of residence in suburban."
Distributed Containment Control of Fractional-order Multi-agent Systems with Double-integrator and Nonconvex Control Input Constraints,2020,"['Distributed containment control', 'fractional-order multi-agent systems', 'nonconvex constrains', 'projection Algorithm']",,"This paper mainly considers the distributed containment control problem for continuous-time fractionalorder multi-agent systems (FOMASs) with double-integrator, where the control input of each agent is constrained to lie in a nonconvex set. A distributed projection containment control algorithm is designed for each follower. To finish the convergence analysis, the original closed-loop system is first changed into an equivalent one by a proper model transformation and the method of the L1 interpolation approximation is introduced to deal with the projection operator. Then, by using the properties of the convex hull and the Mittag-Leffler function, it is shown that the largest distance between the followers and the convex hull spanned by leaders tends to zero asymptotically, while all agents’ control inputs are constrained to stay in their corresponding nonconvex constraint sets. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results."

Regional capability provides significant implications in regional policy since it influences the degree to which the physical environment is transformed toward residents' satisfaction. To estimate regional capability, we developed a regression model for regional satisfaction drawing upon a set of seven objective domains and subjective well-being as independent and dependent variables. Residuals of this model were used as a proxy for regional capability.Results showed that the objective and physical environment of a region does not guarantee the satisfaction of residents. Public investment, which does not result in the subjective well-being of the residents, would be futile. Thus, it is imperative that regional governments consider transforming factors between the physical environment and residents' satisfaction in the public investment portfolio."
Analysis of the Partial Axial Load of a Very Thin-Walled Spur-Gear (Flexspline) of a Harmonic Drive,2020,['Harmonic drive · Flexspline · Partial axial load · Stress superposition · Spatial elastic deformation'],,"Harmonic drives are the core components to enable movement in industrial robots. Unfortunately, the deformation of flexspline causes obvious partial axial load on gear engagement. This synthetic error leads to a series of additional problems, such as the deterioration of transmission quality, and the reduction of both precision and fatigue life. This study focuses on a harmonic drive with a double circular-arc tooth profile. A coordinate transformation is carried out based on the kinematics of harmonic drives. On this basis, the conjugate tooth profile of a circular spline is derived. A simulation model is developed based on the motion relationship for harmonic transmission. The effect of inhomogeneity of the load distribution on the surface of the gear teeth was investigated using the partial axial-load index. The effect of different factors on the partial axial load is analyzed. To reduce the effect of partial axial load of flexspline, we select a suitable material and wall thickness. For a certain practical range, both tooth width and chamfering of the flexspline teeth help reduce the partial axial load and increase the flexspline length. These conclusions enable improvements of future designs of reliable flexspline."

Using skills and focusing on the reading tasks, the present study aims to reveal the distributional properties of disfluencies. Methods: The current work segmented the reading data of 110 adolescents and adults who stutter, transformed the data into a vector space, and then conducted the embedding calculation. Utilizing Word2Vec, the cosine similarity was measured so as to look at how the types of disfluencies were co-related to each other. Results: The eight ND (Normal disfluencies) and AD (Abnormal disfluencies) types, excluding the R2 (Repetition 2) and DP (Disrhythmic Phonation) types, were close to each other with respect to the cosine similarity (>.9). In particular, the AD types such as Ha (Abnormal hesitation), Ia (Abnormal interjection), URa (Abnormal unfinished/revision word), and R1a (Abnormal Repetition1) largely overlapped with each other. R2 and DP showed different distributional properties from other types of disfluencies. The results also indicated that each ND and AD pair seldom differed in their distributional properties. Finally, this study it found that several consonants tended to appear more often when the speakers produced disfluencies. Conclusion: This study draws the distributional patterns of fluency disorders in an automatic way using deep learning skills. The findings are of use for the diagnosis and treatment of the fluency disorders."

In this situation, songs from independent labels and new artists that do not have previous information are still excluded from the result of searches and recommendations. In this paper, we focus on making the music scoring model for calculating the similarity score of two music signals. The model comprises the Siamese network and the scoring layer. The Siamese network embeds audios to small latent vectors and passes them to the scoring layer. The audio feature is difficult to use as an input to the CNN because of the dimensionality problem. Our approach is compared to previous works because it retains the sequence information of the peak frequencies in the spectrogram by transforming it into a graph. The effectiveness of the graphical approach is shown as the result of the experiment."

The PLA was blended through reactive extrusion with functionalized silica, where silica network was formed by grafting-condensation reaction with tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and (3-glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane.The chemical structure and morphology were investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectra, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope and field-emission scanning electron microscope. Also, thermal, rheological properties and degradation behavior were measured. The glass transition temperature of the hybrids tended to decrease with increasing TEOS contents, while the degrees of crystallinity increased to about 57% according to TEOS contents. The complex viscosity and storage modulus of PLA/silica hybrids were enhanced clearly compared to that of neat PLA.While the molecular weight of pure PLA was decreased about 12% during processing, the decrease was smaller as less than 10% by the addition of TEOS. The η0 (zero-shear rate viscosity) using the Cross model was more than doubled by introducing TEOS. The resistance of hydrolysis was also improved as a result of the addition of silica network. In conclusion, the hybridization of PLA and silica network influenced the thermal and rheological properties, by which it may be possible to apply for various manufacturing process such as foam molding and blow molding, etc."

Application of synthesized bovine serum albumin-magnetic iron oxide for phosphate recovery,2020,['Bovine serum albumin Phosphate Adsorption Desorption Wastewater Reusability'],,"Phosphorous is an essential nutrient that is widely used as a fertilizer in agriculture. However, itsincreased discharge from agricultural runoff contributes to eutrophication, necessitating its removalfrom wastewater. Adsorption is one of several treatment processes for this purpose. In this study, bovineserum albumin-magnetic iron oxide (BSA-MIO) was successfully synthesized using the co-precipitationmethod. Its morphology was characterized byfield emission scanning electron microscopy, energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Differentparameters that affect adsorption, such as initial phosphate concentration, reaction time, adsorbentdosage, pH, coexisting anions, and temperature, were investigated. The results showed that phosphateadsorption increased with reaction time and temperature while it decreased with an increase in solutionpH. The phosphate adsorption equilibrium time using BSA-MIO was 1 h. The estimated maximumadsorption capacity of BSA-MIO was 20.7 mg P g 1. Moreover, the pseudo-second-order model(R2 > 0.99) and Langmuir model (R2 > 0.99) elucidated the better description of the adsorption kineticsand isotherm, respectively, thereby suggesting the chemisorption nature of adsorption. The coexistinganions (NO3, Cl , SO42 , and CO32 ) showed no significant effect on phosphate adsorption. Moreover,the adsorbed phosphate was successfully desorbed using different concentrations and combinations ofNaOH and NaCl.© 2020 The Korean"

The importance of 1) understanding the reality of child sexual violence 2) caring for not only the victim but his/her family and community 3) recreating child safe zones which have been lost in our current society 4) healing the victim through an emotionally safe support system and play 5) finding healing through play and reconnecting with the father figure and 6) establishing a safe justice system that will protect the victim when sexual violence is reported to the media and testified in court. These measures not only elucidate how to provide care for the victim of this incident but also prevent the suffering of future victims of sexual violence. Through these explorations, 3 conclusions can be made about pastoral care and counseling for victims and their community. First, victims should be fully listened to and empathized with so that they find a sense of safety. This will allow them to rediscover their new self, seek new relationships and experience a new God. Second, the church must focus on creating a safe Kingdom of God through implementing new safety policies, such as the Safe Sanctuary Movement. Third, the church must be able to connect with victims’ multifaceted trauma in order for them to eventually experience the transformative love of God."

It is an in-depth analysis of the process of formation.Furthermore, the actual and realistic goal of this research is to provide a new theoretical model for today's mind, body, and character education through this work.This study adopts the subject matter of personal discipline as the subject of academic study. The results of this study may also provide a way to overcome the extreme neurotic neurosis, which is derived from the mental uniformity and fetishism of modern people.I am especially concerned with the serious moral hazards that are inadvertently infiltrated among the older generations of our society today, and with the extreme selfishness of future generations (youths, college students, wandering drunkards) who are swept up in the neoliberal rivalry. I tried to find an alternative to the phenomenon.First of all, I concentrated on the topic of trying to bring out the Taoist elements that permeated the process of neo-Confucianism.Confucianism comes to Song(宋-dinasty) in particular, and it is organized and organized in a new form. the Great Absolutethe diagram(太極圖說) is a model of Taoism’endlessness diagram.The practice of Taoism was to acquire Tao (Natural flow: Providence of nature) through this, and to obtain unemployed and eternal life. In Taoism, nature refers to the basic or main body of man's mental and consciousness activities, and Ming refers to the basic or main body of human functional activity. The surnames and progenitors mutually support each other while maintaining and preserving the life of the human body. Therefore, Taoism understands the statement of life as life.The theory that explores the interrelationship of nature, name, and name is also called ‘name theory’. The statement theory occupied an important place in ancient ceramic art.Taoism's Inner Dan Theory first succeeds in converting this spirit into God after wiping the master craft that transforms the body that forms the body into spirit through physical training. Through this he insisted on the practice of changing this deity into a state of return tragedy that eventually transformed this deity into Taihe.This Taoist training method is based on the diagnostic non-progression, and attempted to reduce the non-progression through training. This ‘doukgeukdo’ made it possible for the birth of neo-Confucianism and became the basis for the ‘taegeuk doctrine’."

Usually defined as constant and variable capital respectively, they are subject to the ownership of the capital. However, today’s era of the general intellect and the affect where the creation of wealth and value increasingly depends upon the so-called ‘society-factory’, algorithm and big data should be considered in terms of living labor rather than capital’s exclusive property. Algorithm’s surplus value of code is already a product of mass intellectuality and its dominant development model of open-source shows the impossibility of algorithm to remain in capital’s hands. Big data’s surplus value of flow is the a product of interaction and affect among numerous human/non-human agencies in digital networks. The affective value of big data is commodified and commercialized via various data derivatives transforming individuals into dividuals in non-linguistic and non-cognitive ways. Although capital’s monopoly of algorithm and big data is a crucial device for the maintenance of the enclosure of the affect, the surplus value of code and flow does not any longer follow the lineal relationship between input and output of capital."

The implementation of the principle of low-carbon development is in line with the gradual transformation of the world energy – the transition from fossil fuels as the main source of primary energy resources to other sources of energy. The relevance of the study is determined by the fact that the most important element of development is the possibility of consumption of energy resources and, accordingly, the possibility of their production in the context of economic changes. The methods of statistical analysis, mathematical modelling, the method of criteria estimates were used in the work. Based on the developed mathematical model of behavior of the control object, it is possible to predict the state of stable equilibrium of the energy security territory.

Efficient treatment of anthraquinone dye wastewater by adsorption using sunflower torus-like magnesium hydroxide microspheres,2020,"['Synthesis', 'Sunflower Torus-like', 'Magnesium Hydroxide', 'Adsorption', 'Reactive Blue 19', 'Alizarin Red S']",,"Novel sunflower torus-like magnesium hydroxide (MH) microsphere particles were prepared by a facile one-step, self-assembly method. The synthesized products and the mechanism of adsorption of samples of the anthraquinone dyes reactive blue 19 (RB19) and alizarin red S (ARS) were analyzed by different modern characterization techniques, such as X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The adsorptive potential of the as-prepared microspheres for the removal of RB19 and ARS in aqueous solution was evaluated. The effects of multiple condition parameters, including, adsorbent dosage, adsorption time, adsorption temperature, wastewater pH, rotating speed and sodium chloride concentration on the removal of the dyes from the wastewater were studied in detail. The effect of the structural and shape properties of the MH adsorbent on the dye adsorption performances was also studied. The results showed that sunflower torus-like MH was an effective adsorbent for dye removal. The removal rates of ARS and RB19 were 91.65% and 83.03%, respectively, under the optimized conditions. The maximum adsorption capacity of the microspheres was 349.85mg/g for ARS and 231.78mg/g for RB19 at 25 oC. The equilibrium adsorption experimental data of the microsphere adsorption conformed to the Freundlich isotherm for ARS and the Langmuir isotherm for RB19. The adsorption kinetics experimental studies showed that the pseudo-second-order and pseudo-first-order model perfectly fit for both ARS and RB19 microsphere adsorption. RB19 and ARS were absorbed on the sunflower torus-like MH surface via the formation of H-bonds. Thus, the sunflower torus-like MH microsphere particles are an effective purifying agent for the removal of the anthraquinone dyes ARS and RB19 from wastewater."

Semi-active eddy current pendulum tuned mass damper with variable frequency and damping,2020,"['uned mass damper', 'semi-active control', 'variable pendulum', 'eddy current damping', 'variable damping', 'nonlinear control']",,"In order to protect a structure over its full life cycle, a novel tuned mass damper (TMD), the so-called semi-active eddy current pendulum tuned mass damper (SAEC-PTMD), which can retune its frequency and damping ratio in real-time, is proposed in this study. The structural instantaneous frequency is identified through a Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT), and the SAECPTMD pendulum is adjusted through an HHT-based control algorithm. The eddy current damping parameters are discussed, and the relationship between effective damping coefficients and air gaps is fitted through a polynomial function. The semi-active eddy current damping can be adjusted in real-time by adjusting the air gap based on the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)-based control algorithm. To verify the vibration control effect of the SAEC-PTMD, an idealized linear primary structure equipped with an SAECPTMD excited by harmonic excitations and near-fault pulse-like earthquake excitations is proposed as one of the two case studies. Under strong earthquakes, structures may go into the nonlinear state, while the Bouc-Wen model has a wild application in simulating the hysteretic characteristic. Therefore, in the other case study, a nonlinear primary structure based on the Bouc-Wen model is proposed. An optimal passive TMD is used for comparison and the detuning effect, which results from the cumulative damage to primary structures, is considered. The maximum and root-mean-square (RMS) values of structural acceleration and displacement time history response, structural acceleration, and displacement response spectra are used as evaluation indices. Power analyses for one earthquake excitation are presented as an example to further study the energy dissipation effect of an SAECPTMD. The results indicate that an SAEC-PTMD performs better than an optimized passive TMD, both before and after damage occurs to the primary structure."

The influence of shell concentration and core feed/flow rate (ml/h) on the physical, chemical, mechanical and release properties of drug incorporated coaxial fibers wereevaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanningcalorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, universal testing machine (UTM) and highperformanceliquid chromatography (HPLC). SEM results revealed the influence of feed/flow rate on pore size (in the range586-1036 nm) and fiber diameter (i.e. 621-1650 nm) of the coaxial fibers. TEM analysis confirmed the presence of coreshellmorphology. DSC results conferred that drugs were in an amorphous form within core-shell fibers. The FT-IR spectraestablished the drug encapsulation by the electrospinning process. Swelling studies demonstrate that increasing the shell(PCL) concentration i.e. 4-10 % w/v decreases the swelling ratio (295-140 %). The drugs release kinetics satisfactorilydescribed by first-order (R2>0.95) model and Korsmeyer-Peppas model (R2≥0.95) for all the prepared core-shellformulations. These formulations were found to follow anomalous non-Fickian transport, which suggests that the drugrelease is controlled by both diffusion and erosion of polymer matrix. These results clearly demonstrate that it is possible tocontrol the release rate for the two hydrophobic (contraceptive) drugs through coaxial electrospinning process for the firsttime to the best of our knowledge."

In particular, idle industrial facilities used in the previous era have emerged as urban problems in the era of environmental degradation and climate change, which have been required to be transformed into competitive place assets. To become a meaningful urban brand, as a place asset, it must be built on the basis of the value understanding of urban customers living and experiencing the city and be branded as a continuous management. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to present a strategic urban branding study centered on urban customers through place assetization by extracting value factors for place assetization of idle industrial facilities. (Method) This study extracted the value factors of place assetization of idle industrial facilities through prior studies, and derived the strategic urban branding directions of urban customer-centeredness through theoretical consideration. Based on this, the analysis model (proposal) was presented and quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted. Further, expert evaluation was conducted to verify the analysis. Six of the representative sites that have been regenerated within past 20 years were analyzed for each type of idle industrial facilities, including in London, New York, and Paris, which are the top countries in the global urban competitiveness rankings, Copenhagen, which is ranked in the middle, and Seoul and Busan, the nation’s largest cities. (Results) The main value factors of the assetization of idle industrial facilities were contextuality, positivity, novelty, and topics from a constructive perspective, and the strategic urban branding characteristics centered on the needs of urban customers were analyzed in three aspects: formation of residential affection value, management of tourist experience value, and enhancement of business investment value. As a result, it was analyzed that the degree of reflection of the constructive and managerial value factors of the place assetization of idle industrial facilities affects urban branding. (Conclusions) Idle industrial facilities have potential as urban brands with unique context and accumulated human activities, and through place assetization, can be converted into sufficient resources for urban competitiveness. The study intended to clarify that the place assetization of idle industrial facilities would be a means to establish an exclusive brand and induce pride and loyalty from urban customers. Through this study, we hope that the location assetization of idle industrial facilities will be recognized as an important strategy to improve urban competitiveness and serve as basic data for the active attempt of urban branding plans in the future."
Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Triolein Selective Lipase from Soil Environmental Genes,2020,"['Lipase', 'rhizosphere', 'metagenomics', '3D-structure', 'triolein selectivity']",,"A novel lipase gene, Lip-1420, was isolated from a metagenomic library constructed from reed marsh from Mt.

The ORF-3 gene was inserted into the pET21a plasmid containing the C-terminal 6-His tag and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) to express the recombinant lipase protein. Lip-1420 was purified using a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The gene was registered in GenBank (MH628529). The values of Km and Vmax were determined as 0.268 mM and 1.821 units, respectively, at 40℃ and pH 8.0, using p-nitrophenyl palmitate as the substrate. This lipase belongs to family IV taxonomically because it has conserved HGGG and GDSAG motifs in the constitutive amino acid sequence. According to the predicted structural model, the binding sites are represented by residues H78, G81, D150, S151, A152, V181, and D236. Finally, Lip-1420 showed triolein selectivity for methanolysis between triolein (18:1) and tristearin (18:0) substrates. Further study of the selective mechanism and structure-function relationship of this new lipase could be useful for more practical applications."
Performance validation and application of a mixed force-displacement loading strategy for bi-directional hybrid simulation,2020,"['bi-directional hybrid simulation', 'bi-directional pseudo-dynamic test', 'mixed force-displacement loading', 'redundant actuator', 'force distribution optimization']",,"Hybrid simulation (HS) is a versatile tool for structural performance evaluation under dynamic loads. Although real structural responses are often multiple-directional owing to an eccentric mass/stiffness of the structure and/or excitations not along structural major axes, few HS in this field takes into account structural responses in multiple directions. Multi-directional loading is more challenging than uni-directional loading as there is a nonlinear transformation between actuator and specimen coordinate systems, increasing the difficulty of suppressing loading error. Moreover, redundant actuators may exist in multi-directional hybrid simulations of large-scale structures, which requires the loading strategy to contain ineffective loading of multiple actuators. To address these issues, lately a new strategy was conceived for accurate reproduction of desired displacements in bi-directional hybrid simulations (BHS), which is characterized in two features, i.e., iterative displacement command updating based on the Jacobian matrix considering nonlinear geometric relationships, and force-based control for compensating ineffective forces of redundant actuators. This paper performs performance validation and application of this new mixed loading strategy. In particular, virtual BHS considering linear and nonlinear specimen models, and the diversity of actuator properties were carried out. A validation test was implemented with a steel frame specimen. A real application of this strategy to BHS on a full-scale 2-story frame specimen was performed.

This technique has the advantage of representing large deformations; however, its disadvantage is the increased analysis time owing to the highly nonlinear stiffness matrix. In this study, a nondimensional equation of motion is developed to reduce the analysis time. The two-dimensional equation of motion can be converted into a non-dimensional equation of motion by introducing variables that transform time, length, and force into non-dimensional variables. In particular, in this study, six stiffness matrix models are proposed. The analysis efficiency of the developed non-dimensional equation of motion is verified through a free-falling pendulum example, and proven through the straight avoidance behavior of a flexible hose. The results confirm that the developed equation of motion is more efficient than the dimensional equation of motion for solving two-dimensional problems."

They should express “life,” which escapes when one attempts to capture in one’s art. The modern writers should look into the dark region of human psychology and the Russian writers excel in exploring the mysterious place. Woolf argues that there is no “proper stuff for fiction” which we used to believe in. Instead, the writer should venture out from the literary convention to find new materials for fiction and see them in new eyes. Woolf found a pioneering example of the novel’s new theme and vision in Russian writers, such as Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, and others. These Russian writers had a profound impact on Woolf’s modernist aesthetics and technical experiments.  This paper is an attempt at exploring the relationship between Woolf and Russian literature and Russian culture as a whole, by reading Orlando. Orlando is a mock biography of a fictive personality Orlando based on Vita Sackville-West, with whom Woolf had a romantic relationship. In this fantasy novel, Orlando has lived for 400 years, transforming from a man to a woman in the middle, and then eventually succeeded in having her poem published at the end of the novel. By allowing Orlando to inherit the grand property, Knole, which in reality Vita could not because she was a woman, Woolf made Vita’s heart’s desire come true. Vita’s son, Nigel Nicholson, described the novel as “the longest and most charming love-letter in literature.” Orlando may be Woolf’s love letter to Vita, but it could also be recognized as her Russian love letter in which her long-held passion for Russian literature and culture is inscribed. The paper is an attempt to examine the impact of Russian literature and art on Wolf’s work and life by reading Orlando."

Mechanical plugging—solid expandable tubular refracturing technology,2020,['· Solid expandable tubular (SET) · Refracturing technology · High-pressure plugging · Sealed suspension · Indoor experiment'],,"To solve the three major problems of low production, low efficiency and low permeability of oil fields, it is necessary to develop new tight oil layers or shale oil outside the original perforated section in the well that has been perforated. The key to the success of repeated fracturing operations is the ability to block the original perforation of the well. At present, with tubing fracturing construction, volume fracturing of the target reservoir cannot be achieved due to limited displacement, and the effect of reservoir transformation is not obvious, affecting the productivity of the old well. Based on the above problems, this paper proposes a new blocking method suitable for fracturing wells - solid expansdable tubular (SET) plugging. In this paper, it established SET-expansion cone-casing-rubber ring 2D dynamic model which considers the friction, and contact, to analyze the effect of compression and length of rubber ring and the constraint condition of SET on sealing performance; laboratory experiments were carried out and data on driving force, sealing capacity and suspension force were obtained.The results show that optimizing the parameters of expansion cone structure can effectively reduce the residual stress of SET and driving force after expansion; the construction method of SET and the parameters of rubber ring are the main factors that affect the suspension sealing ability, and paper proposes an effective solution; in addition, experiment results show that the SET meets the requirements of fracturing construction with internal pressure greater than 60 MPa and suspension force greater than 600 kN after expansion, and can be used to seal the well body structure of refracturing wells with fewer perforations and shorter distances, and the diameter can be guaranteed to reach 112 mm. The research results provide new ideas and solutions for repeated pressure wells and high-pressure plugging."
Equivalence Analysis of Virtual Synchronous Machines and Frequency‑Droops for Inertia Emulation in Power Systems with Converter‑Interfaced Renewables,2020,['Frequency droop · Power electronic converter · Virtual synchronous generation'],,"In converter-based AC microgrids, the frequency-droop is widely applied. As a considerable share of installed capacity is replaced by renewable generation, the virtual synchronous machine (VSM) algorithm is presented to address stability issues caused by low-inertia converter interfaces. Recently, droop control loops are also modifed to improve stability. The VSM and the frequency-droop are both derived from the property imitation of synchronous generators (SGs) while researched independently. In this paper, by simplifcations in the steady state, the expression of the inertia emulation of the VSM algorithm based on the second-order SG model is linearized as a frst-order ordinary diferential equation. In frequency-droop loops, as the instantaneous power components are commonly passed through a low-pass flter for disturbance rejection, the system function of the droop control can also be transformed into a frst-order ordinary diferential equation, which is equivalent to that of the VSM under certain conditions. In terms of the inertia constant, the swing equation is normalized under per unit representation. By the same simplifcation in the VSM linearization, the equivalence between the linearized VSM and the SG is also demonstrated. Therefore, the equivalence among SGs, the VSM, and the frequency-droop are summarized, which provides insights for coordinative control of power converters integrated into current SG dominating power systems. For a specifc synchronous generator, the equivalence conditions are verifed by simulation."

We highlight three aspects of structural transformation and institutionalization processes: first, transformation of population structure; second, institutionalization of seniority wage system; and third, reinforcement of generational networks. The argument is that Korean firms’ cost crises have emerged as baby boomers/386 core generations (1958-1963 cohorts) reach the top of the wage range (Pay Range / Salary Bands) under the seniority principle in the 2010s, under the condition in which generational networks represented by labor unions boosted the rate of wage increase in the 2000s. We predict that, the firms facing cost crises due to the overloaded People in their 50s who receive the highest wages are more likely to reduce youth employment and increase irregular workers in order to lessen the cost crises. To test this argument, we employ fixed effects models and two stage least square models (2SLS) with an instrumental variable (IV) to analyze Workplace Panel Surveys (WPS, 2005-2017). Our analysis reveal that the higher the proportion of workers over age 50(55), the higher the level of average wage, and the bigger the size of a firm, more likely it will reduce youth employment, use outsourcing, and hire more irregular workers. This study demonstrates that the cause of exacerbating youth unemployment in the 2010s is attributable to the combination of demographic, institutional, and organization factors. The findings of this study show that the interlocking of population-seniority-generation factors can increase not only inter-generational inequality due to increases in youth unemployment and youth irregular work, but also intra-generational inequality brought by increases in early retirement and irregular senior workers in their 50s."

However, I think that design with traditional industries also needs to make sweeping changes to accommodate the fast-growing variety of industrial and economic structures. This traditional design industry change requires a great deal of comparison and exploration of mathematical algorithms and data analysis that will transform emotional text into statistical keywords.  Unlike algorithms that derive trend frequency analysis used in other industries based on the recognition of problems in traditional design processes, this study seeks to derive and use meaningful design keywords within various documents, such as user psychology, coloring and molding. The mathematical model was chosen by studying and examining the natural language processing analysis method of TF-IDF, a text extraction algorithm based on the most commonly used popularized data. The purpose of the development of these natural language analysis algorithms was chosen as above, thinking that combining trend analysis models and natural language analysis models used in the management, marketing and planning industries would have greater expected effects on the design industry.  As a result, using TF-IDF’s analysis methods, designers in the design industry could quickly find and help out meaningful and accurate keywords. While new industrial structures have changed and increased, objective changes have been possible in design structures that value sensibility. The results and results of this study were obtained by designers using natural language processing processes to evaluate how to combine semantic vectors and vectorize design documents to derive key sentences of desired emotional data into keywords by using sentence words in data in existing documents entered in a similar way. As a result of the experiment of this study, I would like to suggest the new development and direction of the design industry that improves the time efficiency of existing designers."

Consequently, this textual, as well as theatrical, analysis has an objective to explore the affective potential for the Asian American subject to transcend its social and physical limits given in US society, reconfiguring what it means to be American in terms of race, gender, and sexuality."

The degree of conversion (DC%) and monomer elution were measured over different storage periods. Additionally, fillers' content was examined. Materials and Methods: Cylindrical specimens were prepared, in bulk and incrementally, from Filtek Bulk Fill (B) and Filtek Supreme XTE (S) composites using a Teflon mold, for each test (n = 6). Using attenuated total reflection method of Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, DC% was measured after 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, elution of hydroxyethyl methacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, urethane dimethacrylate, and bisphenol-A glycidyl dimethacrylate was measured after 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days. Filler content was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data were analyzed using 2-way mixed-model analysis of variance (α = 0.05). Results: There was no significant difference in DC% over different storage periods between B-bulk and S-incremental. Higher monomer elution was detected significantly from S than B. The elution quantity and rate varied significantly over storage periods and between different monomers. SEM images showed differences in fillers' sizes and agglomeration between both materials. Conclusions: Matrix-modified bulk-fill composites could be packed and cured in bulk with polymerization efficiency similar to conventional composites."

This study investigates how Hwang’s play bears witness to the ultimate vision of his post-racial aesthetics of Asian American identity—that the ontological embodiments of multicultural subjects are creolized as an assemblage of each body that affects and is affected by other bodies, while they negotiate both nationalist and assimilatory pressures in US society. Consequently, this textual, as well as theatrical, analysis has an objective to explore the affective potential for the Asian American subject to transcend its social and physical limits given in US society, reconfiguring what it means to be American in terms of race, gender, and sexuality."
Cationic surfactant modified cellulose nanocrystals for corrosion protective nanocomposite surface coatings,2020,['Cellulose nanocrystals Cationic surfactants Epoxy nanocomposites Corrosion resistant surface Salt spray testing Hydrophobic modification'],,"Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), a robust renewable and green nanomaterial, has potential as an excellentreinforcing and multifunctionalfiller for polymers used in coating and other applications. However, thehigh polarity of CNCs limits its interfacial interaction and dispersibility with several non-polar polymers.These limitations severely constrain it from transferring its functional attributes to polymeric materials.In this paper, three differentiated cationic surfactants: cetyltetramethylammoniumbromide (CTAB, C16single chain), dimethyldidodecylammonium bromide (DDAB, C12 double chains) and dimethyldihex-adecylammonium (DHAB, C16 double chains) were used to modify the surface of CNCs. The modificationswere confirmed using Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and elemental analysis. X-raydiffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the samples revealed that the crystallinitiesand the thermal stabilities of the modified CNCs were preserved. Corrosion protection studies of epoxynanocomposites containing the native and surfactant modified CNCs were conducted using model steelspecimens via salt spray and electrochemical test methods. The results reported herein indicated that theuse of surfactant modified CNCs resulted in an enhanced dispersibility in the epoxy matrices as comparedto native CNCs. The improved dispersion assisted in retardation of the penetration of electrolyte thatcaused a remarkable improvement in the metal corrosion protection performance, as compared tounfilled or native CNCfilled epoxy coatings."
Dynamic response uncertainty analysis of vehicle-track coupling system with fuzzy variables,2020,"['vehicle-track coupling system', 'dynamic response', 'fuzzy variables', 'high dimensional representation approach', 'Monte Carlo method']",,"Dynamic analysis of a vehicle-track coupling system is important to structural design, damage detection and condition assessment of the structural system. Deterministic analysis of the vehicle-track coupling system has been extensively studied in the past, however, the structural parameters of the coupling system have uncertainties in engineering practices. It is essential to treat the parameters of the vehicle-track coupling system with consideration of uncertainties. In this paper, a method for predicting the bounds of the vehicle-track coupling system responses with uncertain parameters is presented. The uncertain system parameters are modeled as fuzzy variables instead of conventional random variables with known probability distributions. Then, the dynamic response functions of the coupling system are transformed into a component function based on the high dimensional representation approximation. The Lagrange interpolation method is used to approximate the component function. Finally, the bounds of the system’s dynamic responses can be predicted by using Monte Carlo method for the interpolation polynomials of the Lagrange interpolation function. A numerical example is introduced to illustrate the ability of the proposed method to predict the bounds of the system’s dynamic responses, and the results are compared with the direct Monte Carlo method. The results show that the proposed method is effective and efficient to predict the bounds of the system’s dynamic responses with fuzzy variables."
Building the Sanctity of a Tibetan Buddhist Lojong Master through His Hagiography,2020,"['Buddhist hagiography', 'namtar', 'lojong', 'Tokme Zangpo', 'the j?taka tales']",,"Tibetan Buddhist lojong (Tib. blo sbyong), or “mind training,” is a specific approach that aims to develop the preeminent ideal of Mahāyāna Buddhism, the cultivation of the awakening mind (bodhicitta). Best known as Gyelsé Tokmé or Ngülchü Tokmé, lojong master Tokmé Zangpo (1295–1369) advocated for the importance of the bodhisattva tenets and lojong teachings. His Thirty-Seven Practices of the Bodhisattvas has drawn the most attention from today’s Tibetan Buddhist masters, such as the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, and laity alike. In spite of this significance, how Tibetan hagiographical texts (namtar, Tib. rnam thar) have portrayed Tokmé Zangpo as a model lojong master and bodhisattva has received little academic attention. By identifying particular themes in an early Tokmé Zangpo namtar written by Zhönnu Gyeltsen, The Guide to Your Devotion: Precious Gyelsé Tokmé’s Life, I offer the first scholarly discussion on how namtar commemorates Tokmé Zangpo’s sanctity. I first reveal how Zhönnu Gyeltsen’s institutional affiliation influenced his promotion of Tokmé Zangpo’s ancestral background. I further argue that the text shapes Tokmé Zangpo’s compassionate character by relating it to his childhood behaviors and extreme magnanimous actions, which mirror the Indian master Asaṅga’s life story and the jātaka tales. Finally, I examine how the text establishes Tokmé Zangpo’s lojong legacy through the lens of his connections with the Tibetan Kadam school and his achievement in visualization meditation. In conclusion, this analysis uncovers rhetorical strategies that concern a prominent master in Tibetan namtar literature. This study moreover contributes to the larger field of Buddhist hagiography and the examination of how its polyvocalic and didactic dimensions present moral behaviors of an exceptional individual, transforming a person from an ordinary figure into a master and thereby inspiring readers to follow and imitate their footsteps."

Objective Present study was designed to report the molecular basis of AMDM in enrolled consanguineous family from Pakistan. Methods A consanguineous family from Vehari District in Pakistan having multiple siblings suffering from AMDM was enrolled in present study. Whole exome sequencing (WES) approach was adopted to identify causative agent of AMDM. Human full length NPR2 gene and sequence with nonsense mutation was amplified by using Myc-tagged pXN vector and transformed in E. coli DH5α cells to confirm mutation. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were done to confirm the production of truncated protein. Computational three dimensional structure generation through homology modeling approach was done to compare protein structure between patients and controls. Results WES reveled a nonsense mutation (c.613 C>T, p.R205X) in exon 1 of NPR2 gene leading to premature termination codon in mRNA of NPR2 gene resulting in a truncated protein with 204 amino acid residues that was confirmed by SDSPAGE and Western blotting. Sanger sequencing confirmed that mutation in all subjects and mutation followed Mendalian pattern of inheritance. Multiple sequence alignment by ClustalW revealed that mutated domain of NPR2 is conserved region. Proetin structure comparison revealed a significant structural part of NPR2 was missing in truncated protein as compared to control. Conclusion We are reporting that a novel nonsense mutation (c.613 C>T, p.R205X) in exon 1 of NPR2 gene is causing AMDM in a consanguineous Pakistani family."

What is a better human being, what is the literary art in the future, and what is the meaning of education? With the advent of post-humanism, which ruptures the concept of humanity, not only general pedagogy, which used to use human completion as an academic identity, but also the goal, direction and identity of literary education have become subject to review. For such a review, the study designed a post-humanistic literary education model by combining Braidotti’s ‘becoming’ concept of the post-human potential of art experience with Ricoeur‘s ’triple mimèsis’ concept of literary reading. To confirm the possibility of such models, I also looked at the possibility of self-renewal and typeface arising from triple mimèsis through literary experiences such as “My Woman’s Fruit,” “Cyborg But It’s Okay,” and “Ready-made Bodhisattva.” Through reading three works that draw a rupture line to humanistic fantasies, the implications of the identity of post-humanism education were derived as follows. First, an ecological perspective should be directed so that the goal of literary education of a holistic understanding of human beings and the world is not sloped from a human-centered perspective. Second, literary education should promote the experience and capacity to feel other people as objects of concern and care, not as objects of discrimination and judgment. Third, literary education should consider the learner to think about what future human beings should be, and to review the concepts of self and life by removing them from the normative framework. Through literature that embodies the process of human beings constantly changing from connecting to others, readers also transform themselves into new self. The key in this process will also be the power of post-humanistic questions that literature itself poses. What literary education should do is to make the learner open in this triple mimèsis process, so that they can imagine so many different beings and be concerned about such others."

Residual hydrogen existing on the inside of forging products begins to diffuse and accumulates at the pores, micro-fissures, and grain boundaries as the temperature of forging products begins to decrease and reaches a critical temperature range, and finally transforming into internal defects. These defects were easily found near the surface of products after milling the surface of forging products. In this work, four types of forging products (shaft flange, shaft journal, thrust shaft, and propeller shaft) were chosen to evaluate the temperature history of products during the cooling process, employing non-linear numerical analyses with the ANSYS program. The times elapsed to reach 250 ℃ after cooling were approximately 9 ~ 23 hours for each forging product. These times can be used as cooling process guidelines on the quality and productivity of products after heat treatment."

An earthquake ground motion recorded in chi-chi earthquake and a nonstationary wind speed induced by typhoon Rammasun are utilized to verify the accuracy and efficacy of the newly-developed method. Results show that: the EE method performs much better than the Hilbert transform (HT)-based method in calculating the instantaneous frequency; the proposed method can successfully capture the global and transient energy distributions of a nonstationary process; the nonstationary wind speed can be modeled as a uniformly modulated nonstationary process, while the earthquake ground motion should be modeled as a non-uniformly modulated nonstationary process. The proposed method does not include any pre-assumed modulation function or inappropriate assumption such as piece-wise stationarity. The method is applicable to the simulation of various types of nonstationary processes, and it can be extended to simulate multivariate nonstationary processes."

In order to solve the problems of conventional image registration approaches, such as long computational time, recent deep-learning supervised and unsupervised methods have been extensively studied because of their excellent performance and fast computational time. In this study, we propose a deep-learningbased network for deformable medical image registration using unsupervised learning.Materials and Methods: In this paper, we solve the image-registration optimization problem by modelling a function using a convolutional neural network with polyphase decomposition to learn the spatial transformable parameters based on the input images and to generate the registration field. A spatial transformer is used to reconstruct the output warped image while imposing smoothness constraints on the registration field. With polyphase decomposition, our proposed method learns more features based on the input image pairs without the need for any ground-truth registration field.Results: Experimental results using 3D T1 brain MRI volume scans and compared with state-of-the-art image-registration methods demonstrated that our method provides better 3D-image registration.Conclusion: Our proposed method uses less computational time in registering unseen pairs of input images during inference and can be applied for other unimodal image registration tasks, and the hyper-parameters can be adjusted for the specific task."

고고학 유적 박물관의 능동적 운영 사례: 영국의 플래그펜 고고학 공원,2020,"['대중고고학', '고고학 유적', '박물관', '발굴', '선사시대 취락', '플래그펜', 'Public Archaeology', 'Archaeological Site', 'Museum', 'Excavation', 'Prehistoric Settlement', 'Flag Fen']","대중이 직접 고고학 유적을 체험하고 관련지식을 공부할 수 있는 장소로는 유적지에 건립하는 유적 박물관을 들 수 있을 것이다. 한국에도 이미 성공적으로 운영되고 있는 고고학 유적 박물관이 있으나 연구와 발굴이 중심이 되는 사례는 극히 드물다. 본고에서는 영국 선사시대 유적인 플래그펜 고고학 공원을 통해서 운영과 학술, 교육, 관광의 측면에서 상호연계성을 강화하여 유적 박물관을 능동적으로 활용한 사례를 살펴보고자 한다. 플래그펜은 습지대에 위치한 영국 선사시대 복합 취락유적으로, 특히 청동기시대의 거주구역과 습지에 설치한 목책열 및 플랫폼이 잘 보존되어 발굴되었다. 그러나 영국 문화재청의 지원이 끊기면서 장기간의 연구 및 보존관리에 드는 비용을 충당하고자 유적 공원으로 탈바꿈하였다. 이 공원은 입장료와 지원금으로 운영되어 탄력적인 운영이 가능하였고 원래 취지대로 발굴과 연구에의 비중이 높은 편이다. 한편, 공원화를 통해 습지대의 경관과 목제로 된 매장문화재를 효과적으로 보존할 수 있게 되었다. 그리고 공원 내에는 청동기시대와 유사한 경관을 최대한 조성하고 그 안에 선사시대 주거지와 가축우리 등을 복원하여 체험적 교육이 가능한 시설을 구축하였다. 또한, 고고학 및 습지 환경에 대한 교육을 위한 다양한 프로그램이 만들어졌는데 현재 유적이 위치한피터보로 시의 종합 관광 프로그램인 비바시티(Vivacity)와 연계하여 운영되고 있다. 그리하여 건립 이래 플래그펜 고고학 유적공원은 청동기시대의 취락을 관람객이 그대로 체험하는 동시에 발굴현장을 직접 살펴보고, 전문가와의 소통을 통해 최신의 정확한 지식을 쌓을 수 있는 곳으로 취락유적으로서는 규모면에서 북유럽 최대의 대표적인 유적 박물관으로 자리잡았다. 플래그펜 고고학 공원은 유적 박물관의 이점을 살려 연구와 유적보존, 대중과의 소통 등의 여러 측면의 목표를 만족시킨 좋은 사례이며, 눈에 띄는 대형 기념물은 없으나 학술적 가치가 높은 취락유적의 활용방안을 모색하는데 여러 가지 시사점을 주고 있다.","Archaeological museums built in situ allow the public to directly experience archaeological sites and gain related knowledge. In this paper, The Flag Fen Archaeological Park, a prehistoric settlement site in the UK, is introduced as a suitable case for site museums, especially from academic, educational, preservation of the site, and tourism perspectives. Flag Fen was occupied during the Neolithic, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age and the Roman periods. In particular, the Bronze Age settlement with well-preserved post-alignments and a wooden platform was discovered here. With the cessation of financial support from the English Heritage, it was transformed into an archaeological park to cover the costs of long-term excavation, research, and conservation management. Consequently, the primary financial source of the park has been the admission fees from visitors and various other charitable funds, allowing flexible management. As originally intended, excavation and research projects are being sufficiently supported. The landscape of the wetland area and wooden artefacts are being effectively preserved. In addition, a landscape similar to that of the Bronze Age was reconstructed in this park, and prehistoric dwellings and livestock huts were also reconstructed for educational purposes. Further, there are various comprehensive educational programmes on archaeological discoveries from this site and a peculiar wetland environment. Currently, the site’s involvement with Vivacity, a tour programmes in the Peterborough, where the site is located, provides high quality programmes for visitors. Since its establishment, the Flag Fen Archaeological Park has been a place where visitors can experience the Bronze Age settlement in an environmental similar to the original; at the same time, they can directly observe the excavation site and acquire accurate and up-to-date knowledge through communication with experts. With such efforts, the park is now regarded as one of the largest and most representative archaeological site museums in Europe. Thus, the Flag fen archaeological park can serve as a good model to meet various objectives such as research, preservation of remains, and active communication with the public. It provides some insights into the site museum plans in Korea."
Autophagy of bovine mammary epithelial cell induced by intracellular Staphylococcus aureus,2020,"['bovine mastitis', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'autophagy', 'bovine mammary epithelial cells', 'intracellular infection']",,"Bovine mastitis is a common disease in the dairy industry that causes great economic losses. As the primary pathogen of contagious mastitis, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can invade bovine mammary epithelial cells, thus evading immune defenses and resulting in persistent infection. Recently, autophagy has been considered an important mechanism for host cells to clear intracellular pathogens. In the current study, autophagy caused by S. aureus was detected, and the correlation between autophagy and intracellular S. aureus survival was assessed. First, a model of intracellular S. aureus infection was established. Then, the autophagy of MAC-T cells was evaluated by confocal microscopy and western blot. Moreover, the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways was determined by western blot. Finally, the relationship between intracellular bacteria and autophagy was analyzed by using autophagy regulators (3-methyladenine [3-MA], rapamycin [Rapa] and chloroquine [CQ]). The results showed that S. aureus caused obvious induction of autophagosome formation, transformation of LC3I/II, and degradation of p62/SQSTM1 in MAC-T cells; furthermore, the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways were activated. The number of intracellular S. aureus increased significantly with autophagy activation by rapamycin, whereas the number decreased when the autophagy flux was inhibited by chloroquine. Therefore, this study indicated that intracellular S. aureus can induce autophagy and utilize it to survive in bovine mammary epithelial cells."

In essence, it is a left unitary party movement in the era of globalized neoliberalism. There were three backgrounds behind this new party movement: the fall of the prestige of socialism, the change of composition and status of the working class, and neoliberal globalization and European integration. The RLP had to acquire unique characteristics: the abandonment of the dichotomy between reform and revolution, the adoption of pluralism and the abolition of democratic centralism inside and outside the party, and the acceptance of the New Left agenda.The Nouveau Parti Anticapitaliste (NPA), which pursued the anti-capitalist unitary party strategy model, was unsuccessful because it did not recognize its theoretical specificity. Many other leftist party movements in Korea, such as the Democratic Labor Party, the Joint Action Committee for a Socialist Worker’s Party, and the Social Transformative Worker’s Party, also failed because they did not recognize the specificity of the contemporary left party movement. In other words, their theory was not based on clear prospects and strategies. The construction of a socialist mass party should not be just an attempt to extend its power: it requires theoretical renewal."

FCB Grid 모델에서 광고 회의주의 수준이 높은 소비자들은 저관여와 고관여 제품에서 감정전이 소구 방식의 광고가 적합한 것으로 나타났다. 이러한 결과는 미디어 플랫폼 유튜브와 광고주들이 브랜드 태도, 구매 의도에 영향을 미치는 광고 회피현상의 요인인 광고 회의주의에 대해 중요하게 생각해야 하며 광고 회의주의 수준이 높은 소비자들에게 제품의 유형에 따라 적합한 광고를 제시해야 한다는 것을 의미한다.","As the media environment changes rapidly, the size of the online advertising market is growing rapidly. However, consumer’s trustfulness in online advertising is much lower than that of old media, and there is also a phenomenon of advertising avoidance. Thus, in this study, advertising skepticism, advertising appeals, involvement, and FCB Grid theory were used to provide Youtube and advertisers with implications for advertising strategies. It was intended to provide a way to lower consumer advertising avoidance. As a result of Research 1, consumers with high advertising avoidance showed low advertising attitudes, brand attitudes, and attitudes toward products. In addition, there was no difference in gender, and when the frequency of online video viewing decreased and the age increased, advertising avoidance increased. Research 2 shows that consumers with high levels of advertising skepticism showed a high level of advertising attitude when the level of involvement was low and transformational appeal was high. In the FCB Grid model, consumers with high levels of advertising skepticism are found to be suitable for transformational appeal advertising. These results mean that Youtube and advertisers should think important about advertising skepticism, which is the cause of advertising avoidance, and that consumers with high levels of advertising skepticism should be presented with advertisements suitable for each type of product in the online advertising market."

This study has identified the trends of the film industry and the location of CGV within the Korea film industry by examining the current size of the movie industry and the aspect of the movie theater industry, and further analyzed CGV’s management strategy focusing on the changes caused by the emergence of OTT service. Barney’s VRIO model was used to analyze the value of CGV’s resources, rarity, imitability, and utilization of the organization.  The main analysis results of the study are summarized as follows. First, CGV is the nation’s first and largest multiplex and has recently combined culture with multiplex. Also, the Cultureplex solidified their position in the film industry. Second, with the superiority of offline infrastructure compared to online-based OTT services, the movie theater is being transformed into a place where people can enjoy culture itself, not just a place for watching movies. Third, CGV used its membership system to enhance brand loyalty. Fourth, CGV was not affected by the emergence of OTT services by actively utilizing these strengths at the corporate level. CGV has been wary of the onlineization of the film industry in various ways, but in reality, both theater and OTT services have shown annual growth regardless emergence of OTT services. This seems to be due to online and offline heterogeneity, even if they are classified as the same industrial group. Thus, the onlineization of the film industry, led byOTT service, could be prevented by utilizing offline theater’s strengths."

Let s look at the characteristics of leadership that has overcome the crisis and achieved sustainable management through research examples of companies that have overcome the crisis such as oil shock, IMF, and financial crisis. Leaders who have overcome the crisis show characteristics of transformational leadership such as charisma leadership in the change-oriented leadership theory or inspirational motivation, ideal role model, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. Looking at the common behaviors, we show ‘honesty’ to share with employees about the environment in which the company is currently facing and internally difficult situations, share a vision and take the initiative, or assign a mission to ‘induce participation’ of employees and employees They were able to derive ‘careful consideration and interest’ to listen to their grievances, pay attention to individual improvement efforts, or reflect them in policy. A study of leadership that overcome the crisis earlier will also help to overcome the crisis caused by COVID-19. However, unlike the existing crises such as oil shock, IMF, and financial crisis, COVID-19 shows signs of continued proliferation and prolongation as biological factors. In this aspect, it can be said that there are limitations of research to grasp the leadership for overcoming the crisis through only case studies in the past."

It seems desirable for the change to occur at a light touch approach for the current standards-based model rather than exerting transformational standardized change in light of sociocultural diversity and contextual differences. It also would have to be implemented in a mutually cooperative way among multiple levels of authority to effect meaningful, substantive change and reduce any potential resistance or noncompliance of local entities.

The Cheongju Basin and the Miho Plain are developed in the middle of Miho Stream near the Mansu-ri and Bongsan-ri Paleolithic sites where have long been a fertile ground. Many of the Paleolithic artifacts which are occupied with typical large core tools in Middle Paleolithic are found around in this area. In particular, the Mansu-ri and Bongsan-ri sites were developed during the Middle Paleolithic more than 100,000 years ago. The majority of sedimentary layers have been post-depositional processes due to the influence of rivers predominantly on slopes and erosion. This study is presented the results of attempted to analyze the Post-depositional process of the Mansu-ri and Bongsan-ri sites. It is new attempt at an interpretation about the formation period from the post-depositional processes in the Mansu-ri and Bongsan-ri sites in Osong-eup, Cheongju. Regarding the OSL dating results are not agree with the stratigraphic consistency and depositional environments show a reversal age. It is not unusual phenomenon because a large number of sediments had received a long light exposure but some sediments were without being exposed to light. It can be confirmed that the sites formed by the sediments re-deposited process. The sedimentary layer is have been formed between from about 15,000 to 100,000 years ago through dating methods. Considering that the characteristic differences of artifacts between each sedimentary(cultural) layer are not large, It is estimated that rather intensively performed during the period than sequentially inhabitants with subsequently deposited. After discarding artifacts, it was re-deposited on several layers, and other artifacts were moved in this process with them. According to the dating analysis of transformation process and the formation model, the concentrated distribution and density of artifacts were relatively low, and the proportion of small artifacts were also very low. These results are confirmed similarly to the cultural layers in floodplain deposits and slope deposits sediment. Accordingly, this site is formed in the process of high energy sedimentation or continuous progress. It consistent with the study conclusion that these sites have a possibility to be a place where no traces of the inhabitants behavior. Besides the refitted lithic artifacts have been identified small quantities about 0.006% and very rare lithic concentrations workshop in the sites. Even some of artifacts have been identified in different sedimentary layers which is estimated to have a formed timely difference of about 20,000 years at a distance of 69 meters that adding evidence that artifacts movement occurred during the formation of the sites. The basis for the movement of artifacts were also confirmed by abrasion damage on the surface of artifacts. As a result of abrasion analysis conducted at the Bongsan-ri Paleolithic site, the abrasion damage of artifacts from upper sedimentary layer were more worn than artifacts from lower sedimentary layer. These phenomena are are due to the post-depositional processes in the sites.

The research was conducted in five stages, from collecting information on representative habitats and species, to designing based on humanities and social environmental factors. ① Collection of information on theories related to bird habitats in the ecological landscape conservation area, etc. ② Establish the basis for the habitat environment factors of migratory birds and social environment factors, ③ bird habitat model design implementation, ④ Determination of the design direction of habitat environment for migratory birds in the Tancheon Ecological Landscape Conservation Area, ⑤ Derivation and presentation of design for habitat environment for migratory birds in the Tancheon Ecological Landscape Conservation Area.Tancheon is designated as a place for migratory birds in the city center among 17 areas allocated as ecological and landscape conservation areas in Seoul. In this area, there are urban islands on which the biological habitats of the surrounding areas are fragmented according to physical and artificial urbanization. Therefore, among birds in the ecosystem's best predatory taxa, 4 four key species (Spot-billed Duck, Common Merganser, Black-backed Wagtail, and Great Tit) were selected. A model design of habitat for birds in consideration of the physical environment, biota, and aquatic environments of the surrounding environ based on the characteristics of the water system according to the type of habitat of the selected species, water surface, submersion, water transformation, surrounding vegetation and green space was created. It is intended to present a habitat design that integrates the bird habitat and the surrounding physical environment if the surrounding space of Tancheon is partially reconstructed through the proposed design. In addition, the minimum and maximum categories of the major fish species corresponding to the river wetland habitat were considered, and the golden frog was selected among amphibians. In designing this river of green corridors in the form of habitats in order to minimize the impact on organisms, the following were previously proposed: a planting plan, noise barrier installation planning, general planning, and various strategic planning programs. These include: 1. A bird breeding model that considers the habitat environment ecosystem to restore the bird habitat environment, 2. Minimizing pedestrian paths to reduce human interference, 3. Considering the non-interference distance of birds, construct aperches, artificial islands, stepping stones, and vegetation buffers. 4. Provide ornithologists (bird watchers) a place which provides appropriate ecology education. It is expected that the qualitative improvement of biodiversity and human coexistence will come through the sharing of the biological space of the disconnected surrounding forest habitat. Accordingly, it is expected that it will emerge as an environmental and ecological complex space for citizens and develop into a multi-biodiversity core area where not only living things such as local communities, but also human and natural organisms coexist."

It should be recognized that the project for gardening and revitalization in the Jeonnam region is a public policy as well as the creation of welfare spaces for the pursuit of health and health, recreation and entertainment, and happiness for the people of Jeollanam-do. By creating a representation of the Korean traditional garden, which is the pride of the Namdo garden, and a future model of the Korean garden, the Korean garden and the Namdo garden will be transformed into the world and become an international attraction. In addition, the best cases of creating traditional gardens in Jeollanam-do through public projects will be activated by voluntary private investment, and the spread of Korean traditional garden industry in a free competitive market system will be a clear fact. In particular, by linking with the “World Landscape Architects Conference” held in Gwangju under IFLA in the fall of 2022, the vision of traditional garden culture and landscape architecture should be used as a foothold to inform the world. After that, 22 cities and counties in Jeollanam-do will need to pursue detailed strategies to become the most indigenous and Korean international tourist attractions. Lastly, the application of traditional landscaping techniques will contribute to the creation of a space in the Jeollanam-do islands that have infinite natural and cultural resources. In particular, it should be recognized once again that this is the cultural competitiveness that puts Korean identity first. Furthermore, it is necessary to reinterpret the modern meaning through modularization and continuous monitoring of success cases in the Jeonnam region. It is hoped that this will greatly contribute to being used as a style of Korean traditional culture that is passed down throughout Korea. Therefore, researches such as re-establishing detailed plans in line with domestic policies for sustainable development, creating effective traditional gardens for internationalization and presenting guidelines, and setting evaluation items for detailed strategies were proposed as future tasks."

On the contrary, in the cultural tradition of the East and the West, the common image of an island overlapped with the concepts of paradise with the shape of a garden, where idealism is working and realized, and a remote place where Taoist hermits and sages live. Therefore, this study believes that by combining the related images of the three elements, island, paradise, and garden, the negative image of remote islands can be transformed into paradise islands, which provide joy and inspiration, and suggested that related policies should be pursued. In particular, Bogildo, Yunseondo Garden, with an attempt to make the whole island enchanted land, suggests the direction that the Korean island development projects should pursue where sustainable conservation and development to vitalize the island tourism should go hand in hand.Looking at the current policies regarding islands in Korea, they are implemented as a comprehensive development plan for islands linked to tourism resources, but they are generally limited to hardware-oriented developments, and the overlapping projects of related ministries and local governments have failed to fully satisfy both the residents and tourists. Therefore, it is necessary to establish consistent policy programs of the control tower and to come up with policies through collaboration among converged experts and local residents, away from the top-down projects solely led by the government. In addition, this study found that as a requirement for sustainable island tourism through domestic and international case studies, it is important to improve the residential satisfaction and quality of life of islanders and to create attractive islands visited by tourists in all four seasons, and to achieve this, it is necessary to change the idea of converting and developing the island into a paradise, where both the residents and tourists are satisfied.This study presents the plan to make the island a theme park by the type of islands as an effective means of inducing developments of islands as a sustainable settlement and a comprehensive tourist resort on 3,339 islands in Korea. This suggests a model of differentiated island development in response to the positive nostalgia on islands and demands for the pursuit of Utopia, taking advantage of the characteristics and identity of each of 463 inhabited islands and 2,876 uninhabited islands across the country. We hope to proactively respond to the demand for marine tourism and predictable reckless development through the establishment of detailed development models and access to these island-themed projects by type."

During the time that she wrote, the contrived delusions of racial purity provoke racial hysteria and the fear of racial passing. Hopkins converts this racial fantasy to arguing that all white and black in America are “of one blood.” Despite the taboo of miscegenation, Hopkins proposes the alternative polity and the citizen identity based on the hybridity of Mulatto/a. Hopkins encodes the public and political concerns in the very form of melodrama. Conflicts between virtue and vice in Of One Blood are separated from the racial legibility and become the psychological, historical, political issues, which negotiate the social tensions in post-Reconstruction years. The desire for transforming the political model of white supremacy is alluded to the family romance of replacing white paternal authority. With a new model of the mulatto/a fraternity, Of One Blood implies Hopkins’ radical imagination on political equality and the racial uplift in the Jim Crow era."

The story contains the struggle for recognition of the lower classes in the late Joseon Dynasty, when social relationships have collapsed. This thesis examines the possibility of hospitality as the desire for recognition by the lower class in a turbulent era, and targets this type of story in literature and oral traditions. This story was discussed in the relationship between the master and the slave, but at the time that the character Park Moon-soo appeared, part of the story was transformed into a “Park Moon-soo story” and became popular. In addition, as the story of Park Moon-soo was widely expanded, illustrations such as “a woman praying for a nobleman” were added to the issue of recognition. Soon, in the <Park Moon-Soo and Butcher> type of story, various moral problems arise between the person who wants to be recognized and the person who acknowledges that, and the story brings together the concerns and solutions of the community. People who were ignored in the lower social class wanted a life of recognition, but their actions to be recognized were also a struggle against the values of society at the time. Among the stories, there are works in which vested interests respond unconditionally to the lower class’ desire for recognition, and eventually mutual recognition. However, a moral issue arises as the relationship between the person who wants to be recognized and the person who recognizes them shows various contrasts such as economic power, ability, and personality. It is a crisis situation in which money becomes superior to all other values, or a situation in which the desire for recognition models the old-fashioned vices. The story calls for a solution by summoning a character named Moon-Soo Park, as various problem situations surrounding the desire for recognition arise. He is a person who can see the pain of those excluded from society without being influenced by personal profits or the other s economic power. In the world of folklore, the character of Park Moon-soo contains the hopes of so many people that he becomes a free, moral, and ever-changing person, moreso than anyone else. Therefore, it was expected that Park Moon-soo would evoke the social significance of recognition, and that the limits of the desire for recognition would be solved morally and progressively. As such, the narrative topic of the story of <Park Moon-soo and Butcher> continues in our society today as a matter of ‘cordial reception’ from various subjects who struggle for recognition."

The shape error of moving parts supported by the air bearing is known not to affect the vibrations of moving parts as much as the magnitude of the shape error. This is called the “averaging effect.” In this study, the effect of shape error on a guideway, as well as the averaging effect of an air-bearing system, is analyzed theoretically using a dynamic-analysis program. The dynamic-analysis program applies a commercially available code in COMSOL and solves the Reynolds equation between the stage and the guideway, along with the equation of motion of the stage. The stage is modeled as a two-degree-of-freedom system. The shape error is applied to the film thickness function in the form of a sine wave. The stage movement is analyzed using the fast Fourier transform process. The eccentricity and tilting are found to be proportional to the amplitude of the shape error of the guideway. Stage vibrations are less than 10% of the amplitude of the shape error on the guideway. This means that the averaging effect of the air bearing is verified quantitatively. Moreover, if the air supply position matches the shape error in the guideway, there is a notable change in eccentricity and tilting."

Product designers need the ability to present user experience (UX) concepts in consideration of the specific situations in which people’s needs for product interaction occur, and to visualize and deliver them through various expression channels, i.e., modalities. This study aims to propose a framework that can help designers visualize the UX concepts of multimodal products or systems to create detailed interaction ideas that can be linked to implementations.MethodsFirstly, through a review of previous studies related to multimodal product UX visualization, it has been learned that it is necessary to study the information visualization methods that can link between the multimodal product UX concept-making stage and the final interaction implementation stage. Then, a product UX visualization framework was proposed, by which designers can consider appropriate modalities according to product interaction needs. This study also presented a design process model based on the proposed framework. Finally, a UX project case of a product connected to a mobile app was explained analytically using the proposed visualization framework.ResultThis research proposes a systematic product UX visualization framework that can visualize and communicate the concepts presented at the product UX planning stage through various interaction modalities. To enhance the applicability of the visualization framework, this study also proposes a design process model that links the results of using the framework to the interaction implementation stage.ConclusionThe proposed visualization framework provides the foundation for the systematic transformation of design information through the process from UX concept creation to interaction prototype implementation. The framework is also expected to be used as a systematic tool to help shape multimodal product UX design ideas in school and company design projects."

To capture the robust representations of cybersickness, 17 spatial perceptual features are extracted including the processed raw data which represent the visual-vestibular sensory conflict, the estimated visual sensitivity and complexity from RGB images, and the depth information. Moreover, the extracted spatial perceptual features are transformed to the temporal perceptual features by deploying four pooling methods which reflects the human’s visual characteristics. The extracted features are regressed onto the ground-truth (i.e., the rated score), thus the prediction of quantified level of cybersickness can be achieved by using the trained model, and whose predictive performance has ∼76% correlated relationship with the subjective opinions."
‘코리아부(Koreaboo)’ : BTS Universe가 미운 퍼즐 한 조각,2020,"['Koreaboo', 'Racism', 'Ethnic Discrimination', 'Fandom', 'BTS', '코리아부', '인종주의', '종족주의', '팬덤']",,"With the group’s worldwide popularity, BTS has not only changed the scope of the Korean publics imagination, but has also had a remarkable effect on the academic field of popular culture studies. Studies on popular culture have greatly expanded their research topics and subjects. However, because existing studies have limited their focus to fandom phenomena and audience communities, they have not been able to expand the social imaginaries that could evolve into driving forces for social change. This study therefore begins with a criticism of existing studies, which have been primarily focused on identifying the causes of BTS’s and K-pop’s global success rather than considering social implications. Following the tradition of cultural studies, this study concentrates on the social changes driven by K-pop’s transnational communication. In particular, this study focuses on the media discourse of how BTS’s explosive popularity has affected change in racism in the United States. With their attractive looks, individuality, and sociability, BTS is considered to have played a role in modifying racial prejudice against Asian Americans, who are often referred to as the “model minority” and defined by terms like “smart,” “good at math,” “asexual,” “unsociable,” and “nerdy.” However, this study seriously questions if racial prejudice against Asian Americans is truly disappearing in American society. What was discovered was not the end of racial prejudice, but rather a newly emerging practice of discrimination called the “Koreaboo” phenomenon. By conducting interviews with American K-pop fans about the phenomenon, this study found that the word “Koreaboo” was coined to degrade a subsection of American K-pop fandom. It was also found that most American K-pop fans attempt to justify their fandom activity by referring to themselves as “normal” or “authentic” K-pop fans, different from “Koreaboos”, who they believe fetishize Korea, Korean language, and Korean culture. Based on these findings, this study makes the following conclusions. First, American K-pop fans’ compulsion to distinguish between authentic fans and Koreaboos is a telltale sign that racism against Asians still exists in the U.S. and that consuming Korean popular culture is still viewed as irregular or strange. Second, racial discrimination against Asians is shifting from a direct form to an indirect form. Up until recently, Asian Americans were directly discriminated against based on their skin color, but now African Americans, Caucasians, or Latin Americans who are enthusiastic about Asian culture are also discriminated against based on their tastes. Racial discrimination also seems to be transforming into a more subdivided form of ethnic discrimination. While in the past, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Filipino people were all classified under the blanket category of “Asian”, Americans have now begun to differentiate Korean popular culture from that of other Asian countries. By focusing on the “Koreaboo” phenomenon, which has been previously excluded from academic discourse related to the Korean Wave (Hallyu) and the BTS Universe, the authors of this study ultimately attempt to revive “the social” and “the historical” within cultural studies tradition."
Changing Treatment Paradigm of Type 2 Diabetes,2020,"['diabetes', 'surgical complication', 'metabolic surgery']",,"Shift your paradigm. We need something creative. Think outside the box. These statements are often included in the inaugural addresses of CEOs or chairmen. I too have used this quote during my own presidential inaugural address. These have been frequently cited in the medical community as well. For example, a PubMed search for the combination ‘paradigm’ and ‘diabetes’ displays 2,500 matches. But what exactly is paradigm. And can it be changed easily? The term ‘paradigm’ was originally used in the field of natural science. It was created and first appeared in 1962, in a book titled ‘The Structure of Scientific Revolution’ by Thomas Kuhn. But is it possible for a revolution to take place in the field of natural science? Yes - Paradigm shifts are constantly occurring in the field of natural science. The shift from geocentrism to heliocentrism is a prime example of paradigm shifting. Copernicus’s heliocentrism is the astronomical model wherein the solar system planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun as the central point. Historically, heliocentrism is opposed to Aristotle’s geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. Additionally, let us consider underwear as an example to comprehend the paradigm shift in everyday life. The original intention of the underwear was to cover up embarrassing body parts, but current trends are transforming to flaunt the underwear itself. This drastic transformation of conception is called a paradigm shift."

Incremental Predictive Value of Plasma Renin Activity as a Prognostic Biomarker in Patients with Heart Failure,2020,"['Renin', 'Heart Failure', 'Natriuretic Peptides', 'Prognosis']",,"Background: The association of N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) for the prognosis of the patients with acute heart failure (HF) has not been fully investigated. This study aimed to determine the association between NT-proBNP and PRA and to investigate the incremental value of PRA to NT-proBNP for predicting long term prognosis in patients with acute HF.Methods: Three hundred and ninety-six patients (mean age, 64.7 ± 15.9 years; 46.5% female) presenting with acute HF were enrolled between December 2004 and July 2013. Patients with newly diagnosed HF as well as patients with acute exacerbated chronic HF were included. The prognosis was assessed with the composite event of all-cause mortality and readmission for HF during a 2-year follow-up period.Results: The etiology of HF was ischemic in 116 (29.3%) patients. In a Cox proportional hazards model, log-transformed PRA (hazard ratio [HR], 1.205; P = 0.007) was an independent predictor of the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and readmission for HF in addition to age (HR, 1.032; P = 0.001), white blood cell (WBC) count (HR, 1.103; P < 0.001), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (HR, 0.978; P = 0.013). Adding PRA to age, sex, LVEF, and NT-proBNP significantly improved the prediction for the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and readmission for HF, as shown by the net reclassification improvement (0.47; P < 0.001) and integrated discrimination improvement (0.10; P < 0.001).Conclusion: PRA could provide incremental predictive value to NT-proBNP for predicting long term prognosis in patients with acute HF."

The Donghak congregation resisted the joint attack by the Korean government forces and Japanese military to the end, but was defeated by the new weapons. It was renamed to Cheondogyo in 1905 and continued the anti-Japanese movement, educational work and so on. Donghak began its missionary work in Jangheung around 1890.After it was renamed to Cheondogyo, Jangheung diocese was established in April 1906 in Kyochon-ri, where Jangheung Hyanggyo(a Confucian School) was located, to take charge of the area. Cheondogyo in Jangheung served as the center of the social movement, national movement, cultural movement, Singanhoe (新幹會) and youth movement in the front line of the local independence movement.Won-Buddhism, a latecomer among Korean new religions, has experienced development and transformation in Jangheung for 40 years together with the area. Won-Buddhism in Jangheung started in March 1980 with a Dharma meeting at the court’s official residence in Jangheung-eup by a visiting minister.Afterwards, it moved to a new building beside the current county office and opened ‘a Wonkwang Kindergarten.’ Wonkwnag Kindergarten became a successful model of early childhood education in the local community, and Won-Buddhism settled in this area based on it. After Won-Buddhism of Jangheung moved once more to a new larger facility in 2006, the kindergarten closed and the edification has remained stagnant.These are cases of religions that have settled in communities as necessary roles in the regions.

What factors make him, then, the most influential thinker in establishing modern democracy? In this article we examine the relevance of Rousseau’s thoughts to theories of democracy as well as the achievements and limitations of existing researches on Rousseau’s theses of general will, and discuss what kind of contributions his concept of general will as “the true principle of political rights” makes to the modern transformation of philosophy of democracy beyond the classical-ancient political thought, esp. in Aristotle’s Politics.  Normally it has been believed that there is continuity in ideas between Aristotle and Rousseau with respect to republicanism. But our concise comparison and analyses of contents-list of Aristotle’s Politics. and Rousseaus’ The Social Contract lead to the conclusion that on the axis of the concept of general will Rousseau has transformed the basis of state-governing from rule of virtue or excellence (arete) to rule of law or constitutionalism as well as the human basis of governing from zoon politikon to sovereign citizen as l’homme egal et libre and proposed a kind of Project for Founding and Governing a Republic, not according to the native-born or natural connection (koinonia), but in accordance with constitutional principles established on the basis of political rights on which the sovereign citizens reasonably agree. Just such a constitution-based republic is nothing but the constitutional democracy considered as a normal model of governing the modern type of nation-state, which has freed Rousseau from the aristotelian premodern conception of politics treating with the nature-like mode polis (state) being naturally formed following the natural needs of ‘habitants’ or ‘people’ (demos) and made him ground the post-aristotelian politics as state-governing praxis of ‘sovereign citizens’ being self-conscious of their own competence of reason as parties of conventions on the state-building."

Shim Hoon felt he had to actively embrace hitters from outside to create a healthy community. To shed light on this, the paper will refer to the theory of Italian political philosopher Roberto Esposito, who thinked together “community” and “immune” around “mutualism.” Shim Hoon explored the possibility of the reconstruction of the Korean people in rural areas, not in cities the center of modern civilization. In the process, the Japanese and Korean men who studied in Japan have been unable to leave the city, the cause of the disease, as they are likened to uncontrollable epidemics. On the other hand, Korean women, who had indirectly embraced modernity, are moving to rural areas and positively transforming the community. This shows that the rural community, which welcomes women from outside and is becoming healthy by them, is a true healing model of “ailing modernity.” In his final work “Sangnoksu” Shim Hoon emphasizes that a healthy community can be created only when there is an interaction between a community that shows a “weak immune response” to good batters and external hitters."

The duty-free industry eventually contributes to the development of the tourism industry and the enhancement of international competitiveness by increasing sales and creating jobs in the sector concerned. South Korea's duty-free industry market is sophisticated and currently has a leadership position worldwide. On the other hand, China's duty-free industry started relatively late, had a weak foundation and had long been under government control. Thus there is a wide gap between Korea and China in the development of the duty-free industry. This study also seeks to explore strategic implications for the duty-free industry by comparing duty-free shops at airports in Korea and China. First, hypotheses and models were established based on existing studies relating to the quality of service and intention to revisit airport duty-free shops. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of 'service quality' at airport duty-free shops on 'revisit intention' of customers, and also to examine the mediating effects of 'trust' and 'perceived value'. To that end, a survey was conducted on those who had visited airport duty-free shops in Incheon, Korea, and airport duty-free shops in Qingdao, China. 178 questionnaires were used for analysis in Korea and 204 questionnaires in China. The results of the empirical analysis are as follows. First, the various quality of service at airport duty-free shops has a positive effect on the intention of revisiting airport duty-free shops. Second, perceived values show mediating effects between the service quality of airport duty-free shops and the customer's revisit intention. Third, trust has a positive mediating effect between service quality and customer's revisit intention at airport duty-free shops. Fourth, it turned out that the 'perceived value' of airport duty-free shops had a positive effect on 'trust'.Based on these results, the following related implications were also presented: Korea's duty-free industry started earlier than China and now has an international competitive edge. Nevertheless, the business model should continue to be complemented. The supplementation of additional facilities through new technologies and the improvement of airport duty-free shops' infrastructure will require continuous improvement of airport duty-free service quality, as well as the establishment of infrastructure for emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. China's airport duty-free shops need to quickly improve manpower service levels and management levels. In terms of products, various sectors such as diversity and product placement should be learned through benchmarking of duty-free shops with a lot of international experience, such as Korea, and various service levels should be upgraded to the international level. In addition, both countries need to make proper use of their latest digital transformation and convergence strategies, and continue to improve and innovate based on global SDGs."

'Time of China' refers to the time when China presents a global vision in a leading position, actively leads to a better world order as world new power. Preparing the “New Period” is an ideological task to meet the “Time of China”. “New Period” means a new phase in the world order that China should create. These thoughts reveals the ideological shift of China that it is necessary to transform from a model student of the world order to a rule setter of the world order. “Narrative of China” is a series of theoretical works envisioning the image of China in a new global environment. First, It consists of a reflection on China's historical experience from ancient to modern. The next factor is the direction of political, economic and social policy of Chines government. Through this process, “Narrative of China” is related to the current Chinese government's strategy such as One Belt and One Road. The “Narrative of China” is converging the multi-layered search for the way of China today, with the realization of the proposed goal and securing universal sympathy as a prior task."

The transformation to the common scale is performed using three separate calibration methods: Oshima, Davey and Lee (2000), Li and Lissitz (2000), Min (2003) and concurrent calibration method. For comparison of calibration methods, results are derived from the number of examinee, the dimensional correlations and the ratio of common items. As a result of the study, the concurrent calibration method performs well in linking than three separate calibration methods. However, when the correlation of ability dimensions is low, the number of examinee is large enough, and the ratio of common items is high, the separate calibration methods also provides accurate linking results. In conclusions, concurrent calibration method has an advantage of multidimensional tests linking. And it is necessary to secure a sufficient number of examinee, increase the ratio of common items when transforming to common scale with separate calibration methods."

A.밀레니엄의 시간차원: 현실세계에서 달성하려면 반드시 다른 상상의 영원한 왕국이 있어야 한다. B.밀레니엄의 집단적 비전: 신성성과 초월성에 기초하여 유토피아를 건설하거나 인간의 마음을 변화시켜 집단적 행복을 만드는 것이다. 이러한 교차대응을 통해 우리는 여러 단체의 상대적인 특징을 알 수 있다. 분석적으로 살펴보면 세 종교 단체의 변화모델과 방향은 큰 차이가 있다. 일관도는 천국의 청사진을 별도의 영원한 왕국과 이 세상의 세속적 사람들이 살아가는 영역으로 나누어 설정한다. 그리고 속세는 본래의 마음을 수련하는 장소이며 이는 도에 들어가기 위해 반드시 해야 하는 것으로 여긴다. 천리교는 교조의 영생을 설정함으로써 인간 세상에 천국의 실현을 창조하였다. 또한 신자들과 초월성 간의 상호성을 자극하여 이 둘이 분리되지 않게 하였다. 대순진리회는 교조를 직접 모든 인류를 구제하는 개방성을 지닌 상제로 여기고, 그는 신자를 구제할 뿐만 아니라 전 세계를 구제하고자 하며, 더욱이 한국을 중심으로 아름다운 세상을 만들고자 한다. 교조는 후천세계를 열었으며, 후천세계는 사실 이 세상에 있는 것이다. 그러나 이 후천세계가 아직 완성되지 않았으며 여전히 많은 사람들의 노력을 필요로 한다. 이러한 노력은 개인의 초자연적 의의/가치(개인해원, 보은, 신인조화)와 현실적 의의/가치(포덕천하, 인간개조)를 지닌다. 이러한 노력은 인간이 이상적인 천국을 만들기 위한 전제조건이다. 본 논문의 비교 연구는 매우 초보적인 탐색일 뿐이므로 이후 더욱 자세하고 심도 있는 연구를 위해 더 많은 정보를 수집해야 할 것이다.","The nations of East Asia have similar historical backgrounds in terms of going through modernization during the nineteenth century. All of them commonly experienced socio political hardships. Three of the most prosperous East Asian new religions, Yiguandao, Tenrikyo, and Daesoon Jinrihoe, all emerged under similar socio-political circumstances during the nineteenth century. There was no mutual interchange, but the cosmological perspectives share some analogous ideology. All of them were types of nativist millennialism. The ultimate goal in all three is redeeming lost elements by magical means—the sudden disappearance of invading forces, the return of mystical heroes or messiahs, and an altered landscape. As Stark said, although it is impossible to calculate the actual rate of success, probably no more than one religious movement out of 1,000 will attract more than 100,000 followers and last for as long as a century. By this standard, these three groups are certainly worthy of being studied. This paper will examine and compare these three groups through four dimensions: the Messiah’s eschatology, the re-interpretation of that eschatology after the Messiah’s death, the rational transformations of millennial dreams, and the institutionalization of those millennial dreams. Analytically, I could demonstrate the differences among these groups through two dimensions: (1) The dimension of time, which can be conceptualized in terms of this-worldly or other-worldly; and (2) Collective vision, which can be conceptualized in terms of utopia or reform. The cross-classification of these two dimensions is suggestive of the general avenues of Millennialism. Through these comparisons and observations, light will be shed on the essence and dynamics of East Asian Millennialist Thought by exploring deeper cultural implications."

Shim Hoon felt he had to actively embrace hitters from outside to create a healthy community. To shed light on this, the paper will refer to the theory of Italian political philosopher Roberto Esposito, who thinked together “community” and “immune” around “mutualism.” Shim Hoon explored the possibility of the reconstruction of the Korean people in rural areas, not in cities the center of modern civilization. In the process, the Japanese  and Korean men who studied in Japan have been unable to leave the city, the cause of the disease, as they are likened to uncontrollable epidemics. On the other hand, Korean women, who had indirectly embraced modernity, are moving to rural areas and positively transforming the community. This shows that the rural community, which welcomes women from outside and is becoming healthy by them, is a true healing model of “ailing modernity.” In his final work “Sangnoksu” Shim Hoon emphasizes that a healthy community can be created only when there is an interaction between a community that shows a “weak immune response” to good batters and external hitters."

First, the pairs located at the seams of the books, Psalms 72-73, 89-90, and 106-107, which have been much studied from the compositional approach to the Psalter, are examined in a brief manner. Then, the pairs located within the books of the Psalter, which have rarely been noted, are investigated. Psalms 108-110 provide a specific way of fulfilling the Davidic covenant through the One who sits on the right hand of YHWH, and Psalms 111-112 state that YHWH's kingship is established by those who fear YHWH practicing His covenantal faithfulness. These two psalms show a case of expanding and developing the typical pattern of pairing wisdom psalm and royal psalm. Psalms 118 further develops the model of those who fear YHWH in Psalms 111-112 by utilizing the theme of the one who comes with the name of YHWH, then Psalm 119 explores on the themes of torah, covenantal faithfulness, and righteousness, to further develops the themes explained Psalms 111-112. Psalms 118-119 also expand and develop the pattern of pairing wisdom psalm and royal psalm. Psalms 144-145 are to be well noted. Psalm 144 begins as a royal psalms, incorporates the theme of wisdom, and then finalizes itself as a communal thanksgiving psalm. It also transforms individual covenantal element into a communal covenantal element with an emphasis on YHWH's kingship. Simply put, it incorporates wisdom element into royal element. Psalms 145 begins with declaration of YHWH's kingship, introduces hasidim who receive and practice YHWH's covenantal faithfulness. It provides a case of integration of royal element and wisdom element in terms of relationship between YHWH and His faithful community. This study suggests that the pattern of pairing wisdom psalm and royal psalm appears not only at the seams of the books of the Psalter, but also within the books of the Psalter. The pattern of pairing wisdom-royal order (Psalms 1-2) changes to royal-wisdom order, then moves in much diverse ways of relating royal psalm and wisdom psalm. At the seams of books 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5, the pairs provides introductions and conclusions of the books. Within book 5, the pattern is much more diversly developed and expanded. At last, Psalms 144-145 put together the wisdom element and royal element into one thematic entity, finalizing the process of integration in the flows of the Psalter. This integrated pattern once more appears in Psalm 149, and then the Psalter ends with an eschatological praise, Psalm 150. The pattern of pairing royal psalm and wisdom psalm is not working mechanically, yet continues to develop along the flow of the five books of the Psalter. The two difference genres provide progressiveness of distance and integration in terms of editing order, etymological connections, and thematic relations, as they move towards the end of the Psalter."

Discrimination and authority are inherent within the concept of “refinement.” Education for the cultivation of such “refinement” established text in the form of “books,” with literature as the central topic, as an authoritative education tool and, among these books, the category of the “Classics” was treated as an assembly of special texts on “the essence of the human mind.” Therefore, the goal of reading was to achieve the complete understanding of texts, language skills enhancement, and holistic human growth that occur as part of that process. It was an overall educational process aimed at transforming imperfect and old-fashioned humans into perfect and modern individuals. However, the concept of current liberal education is changing. Education regarding communication and relationship-forming methods among diverse individuals is being demanded instead of the cultivation of “refinement” grounded in the improvement of disorderly others. As countless unpredictable forms of media appear in the so-called Fourth Industrial Age, problems with respect to new relationships, communication, and conflict will increase. Therefore, the “liberal” education to create an orderly society member is not as important as in the past. Conflict resolution through cooperation and communication and generation of new ideas through the stitching together of fragmented information will be the new tasks given to liberal education. This study was initiated based on the awareness that there must be changes in reading education methods to match conceptual changes in liberal education. It considered, in depth, how a reading education in universities should be conducted. The article takes a brief look at the type of reading education university students currently receive in secondary educational courses. In addition, it attempted to explore directions for liberal education in universities, and reading education, in particular, based on an understanding of the learning backgrounds of current university students. Based on this problem awareness, detailed class models were designed, and implementation processes were presented in detail."

For analysis, the study used the Q methodology and derived 33 statements, which were selected through a comprehensive review and revision process. 29 Christian teachers were selected for the P sample. The results of this study revealed four viewpoints concerning Christian teaching. Teachers of Type 1 perceived Christian teaching as studying and teaching academic disciplines based on biblical worldview. Type 2 viewed Christian teaching as permeating biblical worldview into every educational activity and program. Type 3 focused on modeling of Christian teachers and transforming students lives. Finally, the teachers of Type 4 recognized Christian teaching as teaching while living as Christian. This study demonstrates how Christian teachers perceive Christian teaching, what elements are considered important in Christian teaching, and what Christian teachers do and what kinds of hindrance exist when they implement Christian teaching in classrooms. These findings will deliver more effective and practical ideas to develop educational training programs for Christian teachers."

It focuses on the period of 1965 to 1967, during which the American urban planner Oswald Nagler led a team of young south Korean architects under HURPI, funded by the Asian Foundation.  Drawing from research on the Asia Foundation records at the Stanford University Hoover Institution Archives, this study focuses on three distinct periods: 1) the Urban Design Team phase(UDT 1965.6~1965.12) composed of small teams of South Korean architects, who surveyed urban public facilities and learnt minimum housing unit design methods; the Urban & Regional Planning Institute phase(URPI, 1965.12~1966.12), which involved the Ministry of Construction and other municipal governments to elaborate pilot project guidelines and reports while designating potential pilot projects; and the Housing, Urban and Regional Planning Institute phase(HURPI, 1966.12~1967.5) which involved other international aid organizations to realize plans to provide apartment housing as a long term mortgage product.  As a result, “high density urban redevelopment” methods for “eliminating slums and building walkup apartments” were adopted on Korean soil as a practical solution for urban housing policy. These programs can be characterized as urban redevelopment programs funded by American international aid foundations which aimed to reorganize housing for the urban poor in recipient countries, and as American institutions who saw these international aid projects as opportunities to experiment with the emerging field of urban design.  Korean government officials embraced these novice urban design methods in urban planning strategies such as surveying housing typologies, seeking to disseminate them in other major South Korean cities. However, the scale of housing and target groups of these redevelopment programs emerged as a point of contention between Korean officials and international aid organizations, as they started to question the validity of self-help housing and homeownership programs from international aid, which donors organizations consistently advocated for as ‘citizen minimum standard’ housing programs in urban redevelopment projects.  This research can be applied as a basic frame of reference for comparative studies of the spatial transformations undergone by Asian capitals as recipients of urban planning development aid under the Cold War system."

Cheoldo Park was verified as the first newly planned park built during the Japanese colonial period and continuously appeared in the official planning documents with different names and areas as a new planned park. This suggest that changes of Cheoldo Park reveal the important conceptual transition in the park planning. Activities in the park were understood by analyzing news paper articles and pictures, while spatial changes of the park were analyzed through maps and aerial photos. Changes in a park planning process were examined through analyzing the planning documents and maps. Cheoldo Park was opened in 1915 as a supporting facility of the Yongsan rail company residence complex. As Cheoldo Park became one of the urban parks of Gyeongseong in 1925, it had functioned as one of the main sports complexes of Gyeongseong. Although a sports park was suggested as a new type of urban park in the 1930’s park plan, the programmatic aspect of a sports park was not distinctly defined yet. Cheoldo Park was not regarded as a sports park in the 1930’s park plan. As a sports park was distinguished from other types of urban parks pro grammatically in the 1930s, the city tried to transform Cheoldo Park into a sports park. In the park plan of 1940, with major spatial expansion, Cheoldo Park became Ichon Park to be a main large park and sports park of Gyeongseong. Cheoldo Park contributed to the establishing a new direction of modern park planning, shifting from planning focus on quantitative improvement to qualitative improvement of urban parks. It also provided a realistic model to implement the park plans to overcome various limitations of the Japanese colonial period."
부실대출 메타효율성의 추정 : 부산·경남의 신협을 중심으로,2020,"['Non-performing loan', 'Meta efficiency', 'The credit union', 'Technical  efficiency', 'Technology gap']",,"With the prospect of negative growth in the economy due to the prolonged spread of COVID-19 around the world, we are continuing to cut the base interest rate. The cut in interest rates will deteriorate the profitability of financial institutions and have side effects. The main source of income for financial institutions is the loan-to-deposit margin. The credit union's loan-to-deposit margin at the end of 2009 was 3.60%, but at the end of 2019, the loan-to-deposit margin continued to decrease to 2.42%. The global economic recession and a cut in the base interest rate will lead to a decrease in the credit union's loan-to-deposit margin, which will greatly affect the management performance of individual unions. In order for individual unions to survive in such a difficult environment, it is necessary to increase the loan-to-deposit margin, but it is also very important to minimize non-performing loans, which have the greatest impact on management performance. While the loan market has shrunk due to the government's household loan regulation, credit union loans have been concentrated on high-risk loans, resulting in an increase in delinquency rates. In particular, the delinquency rate in Busan and Gyeongnam area continues to rise. The purpose of this study is to measure the meta-efficiency of non-performing loans using a meta-frontier model targeting the three type unions within credit unions in Busan and Gyeongnam areas, and to decompose this internally into technology efficiency and technology gap. Technology efficiency is measured by comparing observations within the same union group, and technology gap is measured by comparing different union groups. In this study, when estimating individual group frontiers, meta frontiers, and pooling frontiers from the point of view of a theoretical model, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and the cost function type are used. This is different from previous studies. According to the empirical results, first, the meta-efficiency was lower than that of the technical efficiency, so there are technology gaps among three union groups. The efficiency levels that occur within the three union groups are significantly different from each other, and the technology gap among them are also found to be quite large. Second, in terms of technology efficiency, the organization union was the lowest compared to other unions. However, the organization union was the highest in the technology gap. This means that the group frontier closest to the meta frontier is the organization union. Third, looking at the yearly average change, it suggests that region union and workplace union show a form of deteriorating non-performing loan efficiency over time. The policy implications are as follows. In the current economic downturn, it is necessary to convert loans to safe assets. It is also necessary to switch to small-scale and household loans rather than corporate or large-scale loans, and to organization unions of stable occupations with high trust or stable workplace unions. The digital transformation of the financial sector is progressing rapidly. To keep up with this, training of internal staff is important, but it is necessary to build digital finance faster through outsourcing or collaboration with external institutions that are leading digital finance."

By contrasts, forest historians judged these lamentations to be an indication of actual shortcomings that existed before the advent of the industrialization. The complexity of the so-called timber crisis debate referred environmental historians to the most important heritage of the German forestry to the posterity: the notion of the sustainability which was first defined in Sylvicultura oeconomica, a book published in 1713 by Hans Carl von Carlowitz. The initial idea of the ‘sustainable use’ of timber transformed into the ‘sustainable ecosystem.’ Theories and practices of the scientific forestry, which were developed at the academies of forestry in Tharandt and Eberswalde, changed gradually the cultural landscape of Germany. In spite of its instrumentalization by the Nazis, the model of the sustainable forest was and is a central part of German identity and culture that has also become defining symbol of a sustainable future."

On the other hand, it is difficult to detect ground faults because there is no significant difference compared to a steady-state current in ungrounded IT systems, such as DC load networks and urban railways. Therefore, this paper formulates the detection principle of IMD (Insulation Monitoring Device) to use it as a protection coordination device in a DC system. Based on the signal injection method of IMD, which is analyzed by a wavelet transform, this paper presents an algorithm of detecting ground faults in a DC system in a fast and accurate manner. In addition, this paper modeled an IMD and an ungrounded DC system using the PSCAD/EMTDC S/W and performed numerical analysis of a wavelet transform with the Matlab S/W. The simulation results of a ground fault case in an ungrounded DC system showed that the proposed algorithm and modeling are useful and practical tools for detecting a ground fault in a DC system."
비대면 예배 상황에서 동영상 콘텐츠 및 SNS를 활용한 영유아 상호작용 활동 연구: 유튜브와 카카오톡채널을 중심으로,2020,"['COVID-19', 'Non-face-to-face Preschool Children Church Education', 'Video Content Linkage Activities', 'SNS-based Interaction']","코로나-19 팬데믹 이후 예배와 교회교육은 급격하게 디지털테크놀로지에 기반한 비대면 형태로 전환되었다. 성인 대상의 예배는 비대면으로 무리 없이 전환이 진행되었으나 교회학교의 경우에는 교회의 규모나 상황에 따라 큰 편차를 보였다. 특히 비대면 상황에서 예배 외의 교육활동은 거의 제대로 이루어지지 못하고 있으며, 이러한 현장에 도움을 줄 수 있는 실제적인 연구도 부족한 실정이다. 이에 본 연구에서는 비대면 예배 상황에서의 교회교육, 특히 영유아를 대상으로 가정에서 진행할 수 있는 동영상 콘텐츠 및 SNS 기반 영유아 상호작용 활동을 개발하고자 하였다. 이를 위해 유튜브와 카카오톡 채널을 활용하였다. 이를 위해 교수 미디어를 선정하고 활용하는데 가장 대표적으로 쓰이고 있는 ASSURE 모형을 개발 방법론으로 활용하였다. 연구문제는 다음과 같이 세 가지였다. 1) 비대면 예배 상황에서 영유아를 위한 동영상 콘텐츠 및 SNS 기반 영유아 상호작용 활동의 초안은 어떠한가? 2) 개발된 활동의 초안을 실제로 교회학교와 가정에서 운영해본 결과는 어떠한가? 3) 초안 운영 결과 도출된 어려움을 개선한 활동의 최종안은 어떠한가? 개발된 활동이 적용된 곳은 서울 소재 중형교회인 A교회 영유치부였으며, 이 과정에서 초안의 문제점을 파악하고 개선하여 최종적으로 개발된 활동의 타당도를 확보하였다. 본 연구는 단순히 동영상 예배를 시청하는 형태의 신앙생활을 탈피하고, 교회교육 차원에서 영유아의 발달 특성과 비대면 예배환경을 반영한 가정교육 활동 및 교회-가정 간 상호작용의 한 가지 사례를 제시했다는 점에서 의의가 있다.","After the Corona-19 Pandemics, worship and church education were rapidly transformed into non-face-to-face forms based on digital technology. The worship service for adults was transitioned to non-face-to-face, but in the case of church schools, there was a big deviation depending on the size and situation of the church. In particular, in non-face-to-face situations, educational activities other than worship are rarely carried out properly, and there is a lack of practical research that can help these situations. Therefore, this study was intended to develop church education in situations of non-face-to-face worship, video content that can be carried out at home, and SNS-based interaction activities for preschool children interaction activities. To this end, YouTube and KakaoTalk channels were used. We used the most representative ASSURE model for selecting and utilizing teaching media as a development methodology. There were three research problems: 1) What is the draft of video content and SNS-based preschool children interaction activities for preschool children in non-face-to-face worship situations? 2) What are the results of the draft of the developed activities that have actually been run at church schools and homes? 3) What is the final proposal for activities that improve the difficulties derived from the draft operation? The place where the developed activities were applied was the kindergarten department of A Church, a medium-sized church based in Seoul. In the process, the validity of the final developed activities was secured by identifying and improving the problems of the draft. This study is meaningful in that it deviates from the form of religious life simply watching video worship, and presented one example of home education activities and church-home interactions reflecting the developmental characteristics of preschool children and the non-face-to-face worship environment at the church education."

During that time, Kazakhstan’s economy experienced two economic booms, one in 2001-07 based on both expanded oil output and rising oil prices, and one in 2010-14, based on resurgent oil prices. Kazakhstan’s economy grew at an average annual rate of 13.9 percent between 2010 and 2018 and experienced significant structural transformation over 2000-18. However, most new jobs were in nontradable services sectors, where productivity growth was slow. The 2014 decline in oil prices was a wakeup call that intensified the urgency of addressing the weaknesses of a growth model based on oil and nontradable services. Structural reforms are now an imperative, not an option. The decline in oil prices revealed that while Kazakhstan’s economic model was inclusive, it was not sustainable. Structural reforms were necessary to shift the base of economic growth from nontradables to the production of tradables.  The constant market share analysis reveals that for Kazakhstan’s exports to Italy, China, France, Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland and Korea the competitive effect is much stronger than the world market effect since the standard deviation of the competitiveness effect is by far closer than that of the world market effect. However, the competitive effect plays a positive role in Italy, Russia, Netherlands, France, and Korea, while Kazakhstan’s competitiveness has a negative value in China and Switzerland."

Controversy about totalitarianism is constantly being raised both internally and externally in democratic countries and leaders, as well as the US-China war of supremacy. In this paper, I explored a hypothesis about the totalitarian process, and to explain this hypothesis, I analyzed the case of Venezuela, which was once referred to as a welfare model state. This paper presupposes Fukuyama""s insistence on the universality of liberal democracy but considers the last man Nietzsche argues for the last man he assumes. Accordingly, the process of totalitarianism was viewed as a process in which totalitarianism was institutionalized and spread internationally through the linkage and interaction of the last fallen humans, the masses, and totalitarians in the international and domestic environments. According to this hypothesis, the Bol?var Revolution and Chavez show the process of transformation into a typical quasi-totalism. Although the Venezuelan people preferred democracy, they remained the last man who had become a man of ""rich consciousness."" While investigating this hypothesis, it was confirmed that extensive and interdisciplinary studies such as digital totalitarianism and the development of science and technology should be followed."
L2 Reading Comprehension and Lexical Usage in Writing by Summarizing Instruction,2020,"['L2 reading comprehension', 'Lexical usage', 'Writing', 'Summarizing instruction']",,"This study aimed to examine how explicit summarizing instruction and practices can influence reading comprehension and lexical usage in writing by Korean EFL learners in classroom contexts. For the study, the value of summarizing in L2 learning and lexical us a gein writing were discussed. The results showed that learners could significantly better understand reading passages than before the summarizing intervention. In lexical diversity,overall learners could use more diverse and advanced lexical items in post-compositions. The average TTR (type/token ratio) for three word lists, the 2nd 1000 word list, academic word list(AWL), and not-in-the-list words (NLW), increased significantly, whereas that of the 1st 1000list decreased slightly in the post-writings. In terms of lexical sophistication measured by the total number of tokens in both AWL and NLW, learners showed significantly higher degrees of AWL, with slightly more in NLW in their post-writings. This positive effect would appear to be attributed to integrated summarizing processes with reading source texts about different topics, while deleting unimportant information and focusing on key words, phrases or sentence level comprehension for bottom-up processes, which was followed by output activities that transferred those expressions into their writing through sentence combination, paraphrasing,syntactic transformation and invention with dictionary use, teacher modelling and feedback."

As culture and art spaces have increased in recent times, these spaces have been transformed into places to create, view and exchange culture and art, and to consume cultural goods. Culture and art spaces have created and developed new genres and technologies that give viewers the opportunity to communicate and participate, allowing them to understand and accumulate works of media. A media façade thus gives a preference to places for visitors by giving an impression over a short period of time in culture and art spaces that are not areas for exhibitions and performances, and providing an opportunity to more easily approach and understand works and culture and art spaces. A media façade is a type of medium that imparts aesthetics and information by installing LED lighting on the exterior wall of a building for the realization of media functions. In order to analyze the effect of the media façade on preferences for culture and art spaces, a research model was established with media façade characteristics as independent variables and preferences for culture and art spaces as dependent variables. As a result, media façade design and media features influenced satisfaction, while the media characteristics of the media façade influenced recommendation and revisiting, suggesting that many changes will take place in culture and art spaces."

By putting the reciprocity of the ruling party and the opposition party into the framework of game theory, we show that the hostile conflict in the political group is in a prisoner’s dilemma. In addition, by drawing up conditions for possible cooperation between the two parties, we infer why the recent sharp conflict between the ruling and opposition parties has taken on such a aspect.  Meanwhile, we advance a series of discussions by building a general analysis model based on the original attributes of the ruling party and the opposition party, taking into account that the interaction between political forces can develop in various ways in the real political process. Through the analysis, the ruling party seeks some pre-emptive level of response that does not trigger a radical struggle by the hostile opposition, and the optimal level will be formed at a point where the cost of preemptive measures and the loss reduction from the opposition’s weak response will be offset. This suggests that in order to bring about a transformation of the hostile confrontation between political forces, the ruling and opposition parties must have the capacity to properly calculate the response of the other side and how to fight.  Even though our framework cannot fully explain the gap between real politics and political equilibrium, the analysis model is valuable in that it opened the possibility of expanding interparty reciprocity into various models by strictly internalizing hostile relations between political forces."

However, research has focused mainly on business-oriented growth that emphasizes efficiency only. However, in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, people have become more important than corporate efficiency. In particular, there are few studies on SMEs. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the characteristics of human - centered organizational culture affects the business ecosystem and firm excellence of SMEs, and how business ecosystem and firm excellence affect the performance of corporations.Therefore, this study focuses on the empathy, enablement, empowerment, and engagement of the corporate culture characteristics of the enterprise and the effects of the independent variables on the business ecosystem and the flower excellence as the parameters and the business ecosystem and company excellence. The main research subjects are the causality analysis that examines the effects on the management performance. The results of the study are as follows. Empathy, enablement, empowerment, engagement have a significant impact on the business ecosystem. In addition, the engagement have a positive effect on firm excellence.The results of empirical studies on the causal relationship between business ecosystem, corporate competence, and company excellence and business performance show that business ecosystem has no statistically significant effect on business performance. Corporate excellence has a significant effect on business performance Respectively.In addition to the above findings, this study can suggest the following implications.First, it is an empirical study of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by utilizing people-oriented entrepreneurship in addition to existing research. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are expected to have lower perceptions of people-oriented management than large corporations or public institutions, but the analysis shows that people-centered entrepreneurship has a significant impact on the business ecosystem.Second, the research results of the serial multiple mediating effect analysis show that the higher the atmosphere of entrepreneurship in a company, the higher the atmosphere of entrepreneurship, and the parameters of business ecosystem and company excellence in the effect of people-oriented entrepreneurship on management performance. It is that the path through which people-oriented entrepreneurship influences management performance was verified by verifying the mediating effect by inputting.Lastly, it is hoped that research on people-oriented entrepreneurship in Korea's SMEs will be activated, providing a theoretical basis for transforming SMEs' business models into innovative types."
A New Interpretation of Rousseau’s Naturalistic Education Ideas,2020,"['루소의 자연주의 교육이념', '자연 상태', '자연개체', '시민적 신분', '학교교육', '좋은 인간과 좋은 시민의 화해가능성', 'Rousseau s naturalistic education ideas', 'the state of nature', 'natural individuals', 'citizenship', 'schooling', 'the possibility of reconciliation between the good man and the good citizen']","연구목적: 이 연구의 목적은 좋은 인간과 좋은 시민의 화해라는 관점에서 루소의 자연주의 교육이념의 의미와 실천적 비전을 재해석하는 것이다. 연구방법: 첫째, 루소의 자연주의 교육이념이 형성된 이유를 밝히기 위해 그의 자연상태 이론을 고찰하였다. 둘째, 좋은 인간과 좋은 시민사이의 내적 관련성 관점에서 루소의 자연주의 교육이념의 세 가지 기본 단계를 분석하였다. 연구결과: 루소의 자연상태 이론을 재해석 하는 목적은 인간의 본성과 그 자연권을 이해하는 데 있다. ‘인간의 본성은 선하다’는 루소의 개념은 어떤 사람이 자연에 부합하는가와 좋은 시민을 양성할 수 있는 방법은 무엇인가라는 물음에 이론적 근거를 제공할 수 있다. 인간의 자연 상태에 대한 탐구는 자연에 맞는 정치 질서를 인식하는 첫걸음일 뿐만 아니라 인간에게 가장 적합한 교육 방식을 모색하는 가장 근본적인 길이다. ‘자연인 교육’은 자연이 인간에게 부여하는 여러 가지 자연적 덕성들을 온전하게 발전시키는 것, 즉 고상한 사람을 양성하는 것이다. ‘사회인 교육’은 좋은 인간이 좋은 시민으로 변해가는 과정으로 모든 사회적 요소를 이용해 인간의 덕성을 함양하고, ‘자연적인’ 사회에서 타인, 사회 또는 정치와 소통할 수 있는 사회인을 육성하는 데 기여한다. ‘정치인 교육’의 핵심은 사회인을 공적 미덕을 갖춘 시민으로 만드는데 있다. 개인이 좋은 시민인지 아닌지를 판단하는 기준은 그가 정치사회에서 자연적 덕성을 최대한 유지하고 실천할 수 있는 가이다. 논의 및 결론: 이글은 근본적으로 좋은 인간과 좋은 시민과의 화해 가능성에 초점을 맞추고, 루소 자연주의 교육이념의 학교 교육에서의 실천적 비전과 교육학적 함의를 탐구하였다. 루소의 자연주의 교육이념은 다양한 환경 속에서 자연 개체와 그 시민적 신분이 융합될 가능성을 모색한 것으로 볼 수 있다. 학교 교육을 루소가 설정한 자연상태로 돌아가게 할 수는 없지만, 교육은 인간이 타인과 공적 생활을 마주하고 공공의 환경과 그 사물들과 조화롭게 공존하는 법을 배우도록 해야 한다.","Purpose: The purpose of this article is to re-analyze the meaning and practical vision of Rousseau s naturalistic education ideas from the perspective of the reconciliation between the good man and the good citizen. Method: First, I explained the reason for the formation of Rousseau s naturalistic education ideas by reviewing his theory of the state of nature. Second, I analyzed the three basic stages of Rousseau s naturalistic education ideas from the perspective of the internal connection between the good man and the good citizen. Results: First, the aim of reexamining Rousseau s state of nature was to understand human nature and its natural rights. Rousseau s concept of ‘the goodness of human nature’ provided a theoretical basis for us to understand what kind of person is a good man in accordance with nature and how to cultivate good citizens in a civilized society. The exploration of a man s natural state was not only the first step towards the better understanding of the politcal order in accordance with nature, but also the fundamental way to formulate the educational model in accordance with a man s nature. Second, the object of the education of the natural man was the perfect development of the natural virtues which nature has given to him, that is, the cultivation of a good and noble man. The education of the social man was a special intermediate link in the process of the transformation from a good man to a good citizen. Its function was to make use of all social factors to further improve human nature and strive to cultivate social men who could interact with others, society or politics in a natural society. The focus of the education of the political man was how to transform a social man into a good citizen with civic virtue. The criterion to judge whether a man is a good citizen lies in whether he could maintain and practice his natural virtues to the maximum extent in a political society. Conclusion: This paper, fundamentally, focused on the possibility of reconciliation between the good man and the good citizen and explored the practical vision and its pedagogical significance of Rousseau s naturalistic education ideas in schooling. Rousseau s concept of naturalistic education was to explore the possibility of the integration of natural individuals and their citizenship in different environments. In schooling, we could not return to the natural state set by Rousseau. but had to face others and public life, and learned to live in harmony with the public environment and its things."

To achieve the purpose of the study, the study was conducted by analyzing the creation master plan of the Gayasan composition 2019. The conclusion is as follows. The creation plan of the Gayasan Nature Center covers the concepts of natural observation path, environmental education facilities, and ecotourism training centers. And the creation plan of the Gayasan Nature Center aimed to develop and provide various experience programs by class, type, and theme for visitors to future generations, the disadvantaged, and families in the region. In the future, it is valued that it is fully developed as a (disabled) exploration site where anyone can explore. And this tendency is also reflected in the development plan of phased development, the direction of the furtherance plan-mission, vision, theme, purpose and goal. Through this plan, this value is being materialized in a phased development form as a way to simultaneously explore the axis of the expansion of universal welfare and the momentum to rediscover places. It is expected that it can be used as a universal model in the creation of the National Park Nature Center with environment similar to that of the Gayasan Nature Center. These results indicate the possibility that the furtherance of the Gayasan Nature Center will serve as an important criterion for the development of the Nature Center, which is attracting attention as a way to transform the (Mountainous) National park located in the region into a germination site of new integrated value."

This study is focused on Brecht""s theory of acting to overcome loss of presence by repetition which have been discussed many times by not only actors, but also acting educators. Brecht""s acting theory has already been mentioned by many researchers as an alternative to conventional actor training. However, not many studies have been conducted on practical applicable methods. The purpose of this study is to provide the basis for the actual practice of Brecht acting and possibility that his acting theory can serve as a link between text and body-centered acting theory. As a research method, we first conduct theoretical considerations on the concepts and limitations of text-centered representational acting and body-centered post-drama acting. Then distinguish between text and body-centered acting tools among Brecht""s epic theatre, to summarize the terms and concepts he uses and to identify the existing effects he reaches while acting. Finally, this paper proposes an teaching model that transforms and develops Brecht""s acting theory through the writer""s teaching experience. However, there are limitations in generalizing its effectiveness because this study is based on the writer""s experience. We hope that further research will help the diversity of acting education by developing in-depth insights on Brecht acting theory and various models of acting teaching methods."
"디지털 시대, 칸트의 무관심적 감상이 갖는 의미: YouTube 음악 영상물에 대한 감상자의 댓글을 중심으로",2020,"['공감', '댓글', '디지털', '무관심적', '음악', '취미', 'Sympathy', 'comment', 'digital', 'disinterested', 'music', 'taste']","본 논문은 오늘날 음악 감상 문화를 칸트가 발견한 무관심적 감상의 특징을 통해 이해해 보려고 한다. 이때 무관심적이라는 것은 개인적 취향이나 신념과 같은 관심을 결부시키지 않고 작품의 가치를 평가하는 것을 뜻한다. 현재 음악의 디지털화는 우리의 감상 방식을 혁신적으로 바꾸어 놓았다. 우리는 공연장에 가지 않아도, 언제 어디서나 음질 좋은 음악을 감상할 수 있다. 칸트는 사심이 없는 상태에서 작품을 평가하게 되면, 자신의 미적 감정을 모든 사람과 공유할 수 있다는 강한 기대감을 갖게 된다고 설명한다. 과거에는 작품에 대한 보편적 공감이 실제로 가능한지 물리적으로 확인하는 것이 불가능했지만, 지금은 인터넷 기술로 이것이 가능해졌다. 필자는 그런 의미에서 일단 온라인상에서의 일어나는 모든 음악감상 활동을 순수한 공감적 행위로 간주해본다. 대표적인 소셜미디어 사이트 YouTube에서 음악적 공감이 어떻게 일어나는지를 살펴보는데, 특별히 감상자들의 댓글에 주목한다.(2장) 음악 댓글에는 곡에 대한 감상자의 공감적 정서가 담겨 있다. 이해를 돕기 위해 본론에서는 방탄소년단의 ≪Black Swan≫ 뮤직비디오와 조성진의 ≪베토벤, 첼로와 피아노를 위한 A장조 소나타 3번≫ 공연 영상에 대한 외국인들의 댓글을 사례로 든다. 필자는 두 음악 영상물에 대한 댓글을 감상자 입장에서 살펴보려고 한다. 어떤 댓글평에는 동의를 표하기도 하도, 일부 댓글에는 그 표현방식을 비판하기도 한다. 이는 무관심적 감상이 어떤 방식으로 가능한지 그 본보기를 보여줌으로써 그 필요성을 설명하기 위함이다. 우리의 마음 안에서 작품을 평가하는 능력은 취미이다. 칸트에 따르면 취미는 자신의 평가가 진정 무관심적 관조에 의한 것인지를 검사한다. 이러한 검사 능력이 미숙하면, 우리는 관심에 의한 판단을 하고도 이를 발견하지 못한다. 그러나 다른 사람의 작품평의 의도를 의심하고, 비판하는 활동은 우리의 평가 능력을 향상시킨다.(3장, 4장) 칸트는 성숙한 취미를 가진 자를 문화의 계승자로 간주한다. 디지털 시대의 감상자는 창작자이기도 하다. 감상자가 직접 음악 콘텐츠를 제작하고 공유하는데, 이러한 공유가 오늘날 예술문화를 계승 발전시키는 방식이 되고 있다. 그러나 음악을 영상 이미지를 보며 감상하게 되면 서 자극적인 음악 영상물도 많아진 것이 사실이다. 이에 대한 분별력을 가지려면, 우리는 사심 없이 작품을 감상하려는 노력이 필요하다. 나의 감상 활동이 편향된 의도에 의한 것은 아닌지 계속해서 성찰해 보는 것이다.(5장)","This thesis tries to understand today’s culture of listening to music through discussions about Kant's disinterested appreciation. Disinterestedness means to evaluate the value of art works without interest such as personal taste or belief. The digitalization of music has innovatively transformed our listening types in music. Kant argues that it is difficult for us to listen to music disinterestedly because of the sensitivity of its sound. In the digital age, however, there are many opportunities to enjoy various genres of high-quality music anytime, anywhere, even if not visiting a concert hall with good sound facilities. Kant explains that an appreciator who evaluates a work without interest expects to share his aesthetic feelings with everyone. In the past, it was physically impossible for us to confirm universal sympathy for works, but now the technology of internet makes this possible. So, once I regard all activities of listening to music that take place online as pure reactions of sympathy. Especially I pay attention to comments of music from listeners, to consider how musical sympathy occurs on YouTube, a representative social media site.(Chapter 2) I think that its comments contain the listener's sympathetic emotion for music. To understand it better, in the main chapters are given the examples of the comments of foreigners on BTS's music video of Black Swan and Jo Seong-Jin's performance video of Beethoven's Sonata No. 3 in A Major for Cello and Piano. I try to examine their comments on the two music videos from the perspective of the listener. I agree to some comments, but criticize the way some of the comments are expressed. This is to explain the necessity of disinterested appreciation by showing a model of how it is possible. It is taste that is ability to judge works in our mind. According to Kant, it tests in our mind whether the judgment truly results from disinterested contemplation. But if the testing ability of our taste is inexperienced, we don’t find it although the judgment of taste is based on some interests. However, doubting and criticizing the intentions of others’ comments of music improve our taste.(Chapter 3 and Chapter 4) Kant regards appreciators with mature taste as successors of culture. Listeners in the digital age can also be creators. They create and share their own music contents, and sharing music in itself is a way of inheriting and developing art culture today. However, It is true that the more we enjoy listening to music through images of video, the more there are many stimulating music videos. To have discernment about them, we need to try to appreciate art works disinterestedly. It is to constantly reflect on whether my appreciative activity is due to biased intentions.(Chapter 5)"
『전시생활』의 전사자 숭배 전략과 문화정치,2020,"['Korean war', '『Life during war』', 'Cult of war dead', 'The religiousization of politics']",,"This dissertation attempts to analyze the nine volumes of 『life during war』 for elementary school published during the Korean War based on the viewpoint of ‘cult of war dead’. The purpose of this is to clarify the anti-communist ideology representation strategy in the textbooks for the place of refuge. Among the various textbooks for during the korean war, there are two reasons for paying attention to 『life during war』. is the only integrated subject type national textbooks issued based on the temporary curriculum during the korean war, Second, the politics of the state justifies the sacrifice of the people and use the 'Cult of war dead' strategy in which the suffering is the object of praise. The cult of war dead is a symbolic national ritual to raise national consciousness during the war, and it is a key driver for the creation of the people who serve as “death service” to the country. This can be called the religiousization of politics. In the main body, we analyze the cult of war dead that mythizes the war experience in the order of'civilian', 'military', and'nature', and how it creates a'sacrificing people' as an ideological state device. The results are summarized as follows. First, the communist army is divided into anti-ethnic forces, differentiated the status of death, and expressed the will to anti-communism through Exodus, who risked the lives of civilians. Second, the Korean military's noble spirit of sacrifice is recreated as a heroic story of death/resurrection, and it is embodied as a stereotype of 'masculine' (or nationalistic). Third, the destruction of the country and the death of the deceased are reproduced as a religious repertoire of healing/regeneration through the identification of nature and the state, or nature and soldiers. In this way, it can be seen that the textbook during the war on refuge 『Life during war』 is a 'model composition of selfless devotion to one's country' that transforms the reality of war experience into a mythical text through the strategy of cult of war dead."
교육에 있어 창의성에 대한 一考,2020,"['창의성', '뇌과학', '신경세포', '기억과 감정', '문제 해결 능력', 'creativity', 'brain science', 'neurons', 'memory and emotion', 'problem solving ability']","창의성이라는 말이 교육에 있어 많이 이야기되고 있다. 이러한 창의성이라는 것에 대해 많은 정의들이 있겠지만 쉽게 말해 “지식과 절차를 모를 때 문제를 해결해 나가는 능력”이라고 정의할 수 있겠다.  그러나 창의성에 대한 정의보다 더 중요한 것은 전혀 접해보지 않은 문제를 해결하는 능력을 어디에서 어떻게 얻을 수 있느냐?는 문제다.  루트번스타인(Robert Root-Bernstein)은 그가 썼던 『생각의 탄생』이란 책에서 창의성 제고를 위한 13가지 방법들을 제안하고 있다. 그것은 관찰, 형상화, 추상화, 패턴인식, 패턴형성, 유추, 몸으로 생각하기, 감정이입, 차원적 사고, 모형 만들기, 놀이, 변형, 통합 등이다.  그렇다면 이 13가지로 제시되었던 많은 부분들에 흐르는 공통점은 무엇인가? 나는 3가지로 요약을 해봤는데 기억의 축적과 기억의 활용, 그리고 기억의 편집이다. 이 3가지를 뇌과학 입장에서 바라보면 다음과 같다.  먼저 뇌과학에서는 창의성이란 것이 신경세포들이 서로 연결되어 만들어지는 것인 만큼 지속적인 훈련을 통해서 신경세포끼리의 연결을 얼마나 강화하고 그 속도를 높이며 정확도를 유지하는 것으로 보고 있는 것이다.  다음으로 창의성을 담당하는 뇌의 부위는 있는가? 뇌과학자들이 제시하는 바에 따르면 인간의 뇌에서 감정을 다루는 부위는 존재하지만 특별히 이성이나 창조성을 다루는 부위는 이야기하기 어렵다는 게 중론이다.  다음은 기억과 감정이다. 여러 가지 내용들을 언급할 수 있겠지만 요약한다면 ①기억회로와 감정회로가 밀접하게 연관성을 가지고 있어서 ②감정이 풍부하면 기억력이 좋아지고 ③전두엽과 기억피질의 연결이 많은 사람이 더 창의적이라는 사실이다. ④물론 현대사회는 단기기억을 장기기억으로 전환하는 해마의 사용을 강조하기 보다는 정보를 빠르게 스캐닝하고 필요한 정보를 찾아갈 수 있는 전두엽의 활용이 중요하기 때문에 활용 부위의 비율 정도는 다소 차이가 있을 것으로 보인다.  마지막으로 교육 현장에서 창의성 발휘를 위해 어떤 것들을 적용할 수 있는가?에 대한 문제다. 여기에서는 6가지 대안을 제시하고자 한다. ①문화로 정착시켜라. ②개념에 대한 재범주화를 지속적으로 하라. ③책읽기 운동이다. ④멍때리기 시간을 부여하라. ⑤무엇을 모르는지를 가르쳐야 한다. ⑥노트쓰기 장려다. ⑦실패를 장려하는 사회 분위기다.  뇌과학에 대한 연구가 비약적인 발전을 하고 있는 것에 기초하여 우리 군에서도 장병들의 창의성을 활성화시키기 위한 많은 노력들이 이뤄질 수 있길 기대해본다.","The word creativity is said a lot in education. There are many definitions for this creativity, but it can be easily defined as ""the ability to solve problems when knowledge and procedures are not known.""But more important than the definition of creativity is the question of where and how can you gain the ability to solve problems you have never encountered?In his book, The Birth of Thought, Lutburnstein proposes 13 ways to enhance creativity. It is observation, imagery, abstraction, pattern recognition, pattern formation, analogy, body thinking, empathy, dimensional thinking, model making, play, transformation, and integration.So, what are the commonalities flowing through the many areas presented in these 13 things? I summarized three things: accumulation of memory, utilization of memory, and editing of memory. Looking at these three things from the perspective of brain science, they are as follows.First of all, in brain science, creativity is seen as how to strengthen the connection between nerve cells through continuous training, increase the speed, and maintain accuracy as neurons are created by connecting them.Next, what part of the brain is responsible for creativity? According to brain scientists, there are parts of the human brain that deal with emotions, but it is difficult to talk about parts that deal with reason or creativity in particular.Next up are memories and emotions. There are many things that can be mentioned, but in summary, ① the memory circuit and the emotional circuit are closely related. ② If the emotion is abundant, the memory is improved, and ③ the frontal lobe and the memory cortex are connected with many people are more creative. ④ Of course, in modern society, rather than emphasizing the use of the hippocampus to convert short-term memory into long-term memory, it is important to use the frontal lobe to scan information quickly and find necessary information. see.Finally, the question is, what can be applied to show creativity in the educational field? Here, six alternatives are suggested. ① Settle into culture. ② Continue to re-categorize concepts. ③ It is a reading exercise. ④ Give it time to beating. ⑤ You must teach what you don""t know. ⑥ Encourage writing of notes. ⑦ It is a social atmosphere that encourages failure.Based on the rapid development of research on brain science, I hope that many efforts can be made in our military to activate the creativity of soldiers."

C. Nussbaum)은 고통의 심각성과 응당/부당 그리고 행복주의의 인지적 필요조건에 따른 연민을 주장한다. 그녀의 연민은 연민의 대상에 부분적인 제한이 있으며 연민의 발현을 감정의 가치판단에만 의존한다. 필자는 연민의 일관성 구축을 위해 고통에 참여하는 연민의 다양한 이해와 연민 감정 개발의 필요성을 제안한다.이를 위해 본 연구는 감정주의 연민과는 다른 방식으로 고통의 문제에 참여하는 불교적 연민 이해를 탐구하고자 한다. 붓다는 현실경험적인 고통의 이면에 내재된 근본적인 고통의 원인을 소멸함으로써 궁극의 해탈을 열망하는 연민의 확산을 요청한다. 즉 자타의 고통 구조를 소멸로 전환하기 위한 연민을 강조한다. 또한 연민의 내적 체화를 위한 수행에 중요성을 부여한다. 필자는 무아ㆍ연기의 세계관과 수행의 실천에 기반 한 초기불교 연민을 통해 연민 일관성의 새로운 모색을 제안한다. 이를 위한 구체적 논의의 전개는 1. 초기불교 연민의 기본적 이해 검토 2. 불교 연민의 조건 고찰 3. 누스바움(Nussbaum) 연민의 이해 검토 4. 누스바움 (Nussbaum) 연민의 조건 고찰의 순서이다. 여기서 두 연민 이론의 특성과 차별성을 드러낸다. 마지막으로 연민 감정의 습득을 위한 개발의 필요성을 제시하고 사무량심 수행 구조에서 드러나는 연민 수행을 살펴본다. 이 작업을 통해 불교적 연민을 도덕적 준거틀로서 새롭게 이해하며 윤리적 삶의 기반으로 논의하고 있는 현대 윤리학의 연민 일관성 구축에 부응할 것이다.","This study aims to compare and review the compassion of early Buddhism and the compassion of modernism, and then to seek various kinds of compassion consistency as a moral basis in early Buddhist philosophy. Consistency of compassion means the expansion of compassion based on a de-attachment relationship.Recently, there has been active discussion in ethics to secure the ethical basis of compassion under the understanding that compassion can function as a source of good and can serve as an ethical foundation for personal and social life. For example, the theory of modern emotionalism argues for the seriousness of pain, deserveness and undeserveness of pain and the cognitive compassion of eduemonism. However, cognitive compassion relies on the value judgment of emotion for partial restrictions and expression of compassion on the subject of compassion. In order to establish the consistency of compassion, I propose the need for various understanding and ethical models of compassion participating in pain.To this end, this study seeks to explore the understanding of Buddhist compassion, which participates in the problem of suffering in a different way than cognitive compassion. Buddha asks for the spread of compassion that aspires to ultimate nirvana by dissipating the fundamental cause of pain inherent behind the real-life pain. In other words, there is a difference from the existing approach of emphasizing compassion from the boundary setting of the target because compassion is emphasized in order to transform the structure of pain into extinction. It also attaches importance to internal embodiment for the expression of compassion. In this article, I'd like to pursue a new understanding of compassion's consistency by highlighting the practicality of early Buddhist compassion. The development of specific discussions for this purpose is as follows:1. Review of basic understanding of early Buddhist's compassion;2. Review of condition of Buddhist's compassion;3. Review of understanding of Nusbaum's compassion;4. Review of conditions of Nusbaum's compassion.Here the characteristics and differentiation of compassion in the two theories are revealed. Finally, I'll present the need for development to acquire compassionate feelings, and examine compassion performance that is revealed in the structure of the performance of the four immeasurable minds. Through this work, I think that this subject lives up to the establishing of compassion consistency in modern ethics, which is being discussed as the basis of ethical life, with a renewed understanding of Buddhist compassion as a moral quasi-framework."

(연구방법) 본 연구는 건축가 손진의 네 개의 유치원 프로젝트를 그 대상으로 한다. 연구의 방법은 도면 및 사진 자료의 분석, 건축가 인터뷰, 공간 답사를 바탕으로 기존 유치원 표준설계 매뉴얼과의 비교, 각 프로젝트들의 공간 구성에 대한 분석을 통해 특정 계획 요소를 도출해내는 것으로 한다. (결과) 건축가 인터뷰 및 자료 조사를 통해 대상 프로젝트의 공간적 특이점을 만들어내는 근간이 이탈리아에서 시작된 유아교육법인 레지오 에밀리아 어프로치(Reggio Emillia Approach)로 확인되는바, 이에 대한 고찰을 선행하였다. 이를 통해 해당 교육법의 주된 공간적 특성이 내부 광장임을 확인할 수 있었다. 도시의 건축화를 통해 실내로 들어온 내부 광장은 손진의 유치원 작업에서도 뚜렷하게 확인되며, 이는 그의 유치원 연작을 관통하는 주된 공간적 특질이다. 사람들이 만나고 교류하는 장(場)인 이탈리아 도시광장의 특성을 고스란히 품고 유아 교육 시설 안으로 들어온 내부 광장은 로비, 강당, 놀이 공간, 확장된 교실 등으로 다양하게 활용되며 전체 시설의 중심이 된다. 주 동선상에 놓여 일상적으로 이용되는 내부 광장에서 아이들은 만나 어울려 놀고, 서로를 통해 배우며 자연스럽게 성장하고, 사회적 관계를 형성한다. 이처럼 뛰어난 기능에도 불구하고 내부 광장을 기본 계획 요소로 일괄 적용하기 어려운 것은 면적의 확보와 그에 따르는 비용의 문제이다. 그러나 개별 프로젝트에 대한 세부적 관찰과 비교 분석을 통해 복도 공간의 확장, 기능실과의 결합 등의 방법으로 이와 같은 제약 상황에서도 내부 광장을 도입할 수 있는 방안을 찾을 수 있었다. (결론) 유아들의 성장과 사회화, 열린 교육을 위한 효과적인 장(場)으로 작동하는 내부 광장을 미래 유아 교육 공간의 기본 계획 요소로 포함할 것을 제안하며, 더 나아가 매뉴얼화를 통해 유아 교육 공간 계획에 광범위하게 적용할 것을 기대해본다.","(Background and Purpose) The advancement of official archives management is one of the measures that can be used to estimate the state of a democratic nation. Diplomatic Archives, which was established in 2006, is the first special records center to be accessible to the public that allows institutions handling diplomatic tasks to observe and learn from actual diplomatic activity. However, in reality, the exhibition managed education program currently provided by Diplomatic Archives is of low quality compared to the actual value of the diplomatic records stored, due to the lack of facility improvement, resulting in a run-down exhibition facility and display method. Therefore, this study aims to provide direction for the establishment and management of Diplomatic Archives by offering a plan for facility improvement. (Method) The study on the current status of Diplomatic Archives aims to clearly define the management of the facility and boundary where cultural activities will be provided. Additionally, the study derived a possible activity program to promote other archives and raise public awareness by performing a case study on new governmental and public institutions. The results of these investigations allowed us to provide a spatial improvement proposal appropriate for the current status of Diplomatic Archives and apply it during the reconstruction of the facility. (Results) By offering ”User Expansion Service” linking archives, library, and museum, the facility was transformed into a user-oriented institution by diversifying cultural activity. In order to realize this, the study suggested the Larchiveum model, which links resources and functions owned by Diplomatic Archives with visitors in order to provide a diverse experience through the establishment of open library and temporary exhibition. Furthermore, our proposal recommends the gradual expansion of areas accessible to general visitors, starting from lower ground floor one to the second floor above. As an initial step, experience and temporary exhibition targeting visitors in their youth will be established followed by the second step in which floor one above the ground will house the renovated permanent exhibition. The last step will involve the establishment of an open library on floor two allowing an integrated tour program. (Conclusions) Changing the original archival programs to focus more on users as displayed by this model can be considered a response to recent users of cultural information looking for a way to access a variety of information in a single location. We hope the proposals recommended in this study can help provide better direction for the establishment of archives and exhibition plans."
공공도서관 리모델링 가이드라인에 관한 기초 연구 - 공공도서관 리모델링 사례를 중심으로 -,2020,"['Library', 'Re-modeling', 'Space', 'Architecture', 'Culture', '도서관', '리모델링', '공간', '건축', '문화']",,"Public libraries have developed rapidly since the 2000s, with more than 60% of the current distribution of libraries.While research on guidelines for new construction along with quantitative growth has been active since 2009, research on remodeling has been insufficient around libraries with about 35% of the opening years of 20 years. Therefore, prior to establishing guidelines for remodeling centered on public libraries, this study conducted an analysis on the direction of remodeling based on the overall remodeling plan of library facilities, not on simple facility repairs or replacement of some areas, among the remodeling projects conducted in 2019. Through this, we derived implications for the direction of the space so that the current public library can play a leading role in accordance with the changes of the times. I want to analyze the spatial direction of the remodeling. As a result of the analysis, the study rooms in all spaces were reduced or abolished to prevent the fall into the study spaces. Second, it was intended to establish the identity of the library only by setting the direction of specialization according to the operator. Third, it was intended to increase the reading area due to the activation of public spaces. Fourth, the focus was on providing services using wireless communication rather than a separate physical space for electronic information services. Fifth, the library as a complex cultural space was intended to secure a connection plan with various living SOC facilities in order to transform it into a complex cultural space. Step-by-step research should be conducted on guidelines for future remodeling as well as guidelines for budget support based on annual, scale, and regional considerations."

Both electric and magnetic field is considered for the problem formulation and the flow is generated by a stretched surface. Important slip factors, i.e., Brownian and thermophoresis diffusions are accounted. Total entropy rate subject to four types of irreversibilities (i) heat transfer (ii) chemical reaction (iii) fluid friction (iv) Joule or Ohmic heating is obtained through second law of thermodynamics. Thermal radiation, heat generation/absorption, dissipation, Brownian motion, Joule or Ohmic heating and thermophoresis effects are considered in the development of the energy equation. Activation energy to undergo the physical transportation or chemical transformation of atoms or molecules is further considered in the analysis of concentration. Firstly ordinary differential system is found, then numerically solved for flow field, entropy generation, concentration, temperature, skin friction, Nusselt number, Bejan number and Sherwood number through built-in- Shooting method."
의학교육에서의 사회적 구성주의의 활용,2020,"['Health education', 'Instructional models', 'Knowledge', 'Social learning']",,"The purpose of this study is to discuss the main principles and concepts of social constructivism, examine the literature on the application of social constructivism in medical education, and explore the meaning and limitations of the utilization of social constructivism with learning theory. A literature search was carried out in two stages, utilizing PubMed, CINAHL and Education Source databases. The first search included both fields (social constructivism AND medical education), while the second search was performed by subject (Vygotsky or ZPD or zone of proximal development or scaffolding AND medical education). A total of 96 papers were found through the first and second searches, and after reviewing the abstracts of all 96 papers, 41 papers were deemed suitable for research purposes. In medical education, social constructivism is applied in areas such as (1) social and cultural behaviors (hidden curriculum), (2) social construct of “meaning” (dialogue and discourse), (3) learner’s identity transformation (expert), and (4) instructional intervention (ZPD and scaffolding). Social constructivism has provided many ideas to explore in terms of the composition of knowledge in the sociocultural context of health care, but it has not demonstrated an explicit instructional method or educational effects."

전동기 기반 다양한 홈 트레이닝 기구의 동역학적 구동 판단에 관한 연구,2020,"['홈 트레이닝 기구', '전동기', '동역학', '구동', '다물체 동역학 해석 프로그램', 'At-home workouts', 'Motor', 'Dynamics', 'Driving', 'DAFUL']",,"Recently, at-home workouts, which allows people to exercise easily and comfortably at home without going to the gym, has been in the spotlight. Accordingly, a lot of household equipment is produced, but weight exercise equipment is limited in use at home because of its heavy weight or volume. Therefore, this paper proposes a new form of exercise equipment that can be used at home by transforming the exercise equipment used in the fitness center. The proposed mechanism replaces the weight part of the strength exercise device, which is the key to weight control, with an electric motor. Three major muscle exercise instruments (long pull machine, curl cable machine, and let down machine) were analyzed by dynamic analysis using a multipurpose dynamic program (DAFUL). This shows that the proposed equipment can perform various sports. Therefore, the proposed mechanism is expected to be applicable at home, and this study is expected to be rapidly mass-produced by emphasizing practicality."

Now, the appearance of low cost capture and storage devices has become possible to get very detailed time data to be used for further analysis. Thus, we can use these time data to get more knowledge about the underlying system or to predict future events with higher accuracy. In particular, it is very important to define custom tailored contract offers for many households and businesses having smart meter records and predict the future electricity usage to protect the electricity companies from power shortage or power surplus. It is required to identify a few groups with common electricity behavior to make it worth the creation of customized contract offers. This study suggests big data transformation as a side effect and clustering technique to understand the electricity usage pattern by using the open data related to smart meter and KNIME which is an open source platform for data analytics, providing a user-friendly graphical workbench for the entire analysis process. While the big data components are not open source, they are also available for a trial if required. After importing, cleaning and transforming the smart meter big data, it is possible to interpret each meter data in terms of electricity usage behavior through a dynamic time warping method."

The project is being promoted with enormous public costs. However, if the cost-effectiveness is small or there is a negative effect, the project has actually failed. On the other hand, if the positive effect from the project is large, a strategy that can be transformed and expanded to other regions is needed by closely analyzing the success factors of the project. Unfortunately, however, there are still few studies analyzing its effects. This study proposes to utilize the SP(Stated Preference) methodologies, CVM and CM. And it presents the advantages and disadvantages of the two methodologies and how to use them. The method of estimating the value of non-market goods presented in this study is considered to be appropriate for unit projects below the central city type.
