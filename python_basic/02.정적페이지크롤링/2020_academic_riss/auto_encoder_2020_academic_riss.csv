Convolutional auto-encoder based multiple description coding network,2020,"['Multiple description coding network', 'MDCN', 'Convolutional auto-encoder', 'CAE', 'Additive noise']",,"When data is transmitted over an unreliable channel, the error of the data packet may result in serious degradation. The multiple description coding (MDC) can solve this problem and save transmission costs. In this paper, we propose a deep multiple description coding network (MDCN) to realize efficient image compression. Firstly, our network framework is based on convolutional auto-encoder (CAE), which include multiple description encoder network (MDEN) and multiple description decoder network (MDDN). Secondly, in order to obtain high-quality reconstructed images at low bit rates, the encoding network and decoding network are integrated into an end-to-end compression framework. Thirdly, the multiple description decoder network includes side decoder network and central decoder network. When the decoder receives only one of the two multiple description code streams, side decoder network is used to obtain side reconstructed image of acceptable quality. When two descriptions are received, the high quality reconstructed image is obtained. In addition, instead of quantization with additive uniform noise, and SSIM loss and distance loss combine to train multiple description encoder networks to ensure that they can share structural information. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs better than traditional multiple description coding methods."
Auto-Encoder Variants for Solving Handwritten Digits Classification Problem,2020,"['Sparse auto-encoder (SAE)', 'Denoising auto-encoder (DAE)', 'Contractive auto-encoder (CAE)', 'MNIST', 'Classification']",,"Auto-encoders (AEs) have been proposed for solving many problems in the domain of machine learning and deep learning since the last few decades. Due to their satisfactory performance, their multiple variations have also recently appeared. First, we introduce the conventional AE model and its different variant for learning abstract features from data by using a contrastive divergence algorithm. Second, we present the major differences among the following three popular AE variants: sparse AE (SAE), denoising AE (DAE), and contractive AE (CAE). Third, the main contribution of this study is performing the comparative study of the aforementioned three AE variants on the basis of their mathematical modeling and experiments. All the variants of the standard AE are evaluated on the basis of the MNIST benchmark handwritten digit dataset for classification problem. The observed output reveals the benefit of using the AE model and its variants. From the experiments, it is concluded that CAE achieved better classification accuracy than those of SAE and DAE."
A sparse auto-encoder method based on compressed sensing and wavelet packet energy entropy for rolling bearing intelligent fault diagnosis,2020,['· Intelligent diagnosis · Rolling bearing · Compressed sensing · Sparse auto-encoder · Wavelet packet energy entropy'],,"Improving diagnostic efficiency and shortening diagnostic time is important for improving the reliability and safety of rotating machinery, and has received more and more attention. When using intelligent diagnostic methods to diagnose bearing faults, the increasingly complex working conditions and the huge amount of data make it a great challenge to diagnose fault quickly and effectively. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis method based on sparse auto-encoder (SAE), combined with compression sensing (CS) and wavelet packet energy entropy (WPEE) for feature dimension reduction is proposed. Firstly, vibration signals of each fault type are projected linearly through compressed sensing to obtain compressed signals, which are merged into a low-dimensional compressed signal matrix of multiple fault types.Secondly, the WPEE of low-dimensional compressed signal matrix of multi-fault type is determined, and the eigenvector matrix of bearing fault diagnosis is formed, which greatly reduces the dimension of the eigenvector matrix. Finally, SAE are constructed by adding sparse penalty to auto-encoder (AE) for high-level feature learning and bearing fault classification, and it not only further learns the high-level features of data, but also reduces the feature dimension.Compared with traditional feature extraction methods and the standard deep learning method, the proposed method not only guarantees high accuracy, but also greatly reduces the diagnosis time."

Scheme of a Classic Control-Based Program Model with Non-Symmetric Deep Auto-Encoder of Actor-Critic,2020,"['actor-critic', 'program model', 'OpenAI gym', 'non-symmetric deep auto-encoder', 'reinforcement learning']",,"Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Actor-Critic (A2C), one of policy gradient (PG) algorithms becomes a mainstream. A design of a classic control-based program model requires domain-indicated experience knowledge based on a neural network for incorporating into the model strategy, which becomes A2C-powered. There are some research studies on the program model using general Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, in other words, A2C and neural networks. The previous well-known algorithms can proceed from a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to attempting an experiment with more complicated additions, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory models). However, there are concerns about the requirements of the current experimental environment when faced with the demands of significant computational powers. Therefore, we employ a definition of Actor-Critic with non-symmetric deep auto-encoder to find an optimal behavior strategy for the agent to obtain optimal rewards with the bottommost environmental resources. Algorithm comparisons show that our proposed model demonstrates improvements of optimal rewards with the minimum limit over the developed deep neural network combined Actor-Critic."
A novel unsupervised learning method for intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings based on deep functional auto-encoder,2020,['· Rolling element bearings · Improve intelligent diagnostics · Deep functional auto-encoder · Unsupervised learning enhancement · Massive raw data analysis'],,"Recently, several studies tried to develop fault identification models for rolling element bearing based on unsupervised learning techniques.

Therefore, the process of removing noise must be accompanied at the pre-processing stage of the vibration signal.In this paper, instead of the signal processing filter traditionally used for noise removal, an artificial intelligence-based prediction maintenance system is proposed, which applies a dinoing model that eliminates noise of signals by using an autocoder model based on 1D-CNN, a deep learning non-instructor learning, and classifies abnormal signals and fault modes for signals with which noise has been removed."

However, for clustering images, the traditional clustering methods such as stacked auto-encoder based k-means are not effective since they tend to ignore the local information. In this paper, we propose a method first to effectively reduce data dimensionality using convolutional auto-encoder to capture and reflect the local information and then to accurately cluster similar data samples by using a hierarchical clustering approach. The experimental results confirm that the clustering results are improved by using the proposed model in terms of clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information."

The reason why it is difficult to detect such these new malwares using the existing vaccines is that they use “signature-based” detection techniques. these techniques effectively detect already known malicious codes, however, they have problems about detecting new malicious codes. Therefore, most of vaccines have recognized these drawbacks and additionally make use of “heuristic” techniques. This paper proposes a technology to detecting unknown malicious code using deep learning. In addition, detecting malware skill using Supervisor Learning approach has a clear limitation. This is because, there are countless files that can be run on the devices. Thus, this paper utilizes Stacked Convolution AutoEncoder(SCAE) known as Semi-Supervisor Learning. To be specific, byte information of file was extracted, imaging was carried out, and these images were learned to model. Finally, Accuracy of 98.84% was achieved as a result of inferring unlearned malicious and non-malicious codes to the model."

Adaptive Importance Channel Selection for Perceptual Image Compression,2020,"['Image compression', 'Auto-encoder', 'Perceptual loss', 'Bit-allocate strategy', 'Importance map']",,"Recently, auto-encoder has emerged as the most popular method in convolutional neural network (CNN) based image compression and has achieved impressive performance. In the traditional auto-encoder based image compression model, the encoder simply sends the features of last layer to the decoder, which cannot allocate bits over different spatial regions in an efficient way. Besides, these methods do not fully exploit the contextual information under different receptive fields for better reconstruction performance. In this paper, to solve these issues, a novel auto-encoder model is designed for image compression, which can effectively transmit the hierarchical features of the encoder to the decoder. Specifically, we first propose an adaptive bit-allocation strategy, which can adaptively select an importance channel. Then, we conduct the multiply operation on the generated importance mask and the features of the last layer in our proposed encoder to achieve efficient bit allocation. Moreover, we present an additional novel perceptual loss function for more accurate image details. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed model can achieve significant superiority compared with JPEG and JPEG2000 both in both subjective and objective quality. Besides, our model shows better performance than the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image compression methods in terms of PSNR."
Multimodal Biometrics Recognition from Facial Video with Missing Modalities Using Deep Learning,2020,"['Auto-encoder', 'Deep Learning', 'Multimodal Biometrics', 'Sparse Classification']",,"Biometrics identification using multiple modalities has attracted the attention of many researchers as it producesmore robust and trustworthy results than single modality biometrics. In this paper, we present a novel multimodalrecognition system that trains a deep learning network to automatically learn features after extracting multiplebiometric modalities from a single data source, i.e., facial video clips. Utilizing different modalities, i.e., leftear, left profile face, frontal face, right profile face, and right ear, present in the facial video clips, we trainsupervised denoising auto-encoders to automatically extract robust and non-redundant features. The automaticallylearned features are then used to train modality specific sparse classifiers to perform the multimodalrecognition. Moreover, the proposed technique has proven robust when some of the above modalities weremissing during the testing. The proposed system has three main components that are responsible for detection,which consists of modality specific detectors to automatically detect images of different modalities present infacial video clips; feature selection, which uses supervised denoising sparse auto-encoders network to capturediscriminative representations that are robust to the illumination and pose variations; and classification, whichconsists of a set of modality specific sparse representation classifiers for unimodal recognition, followed byscore level fusion of the recognition results of the available modalities. Experiments conducted on theconstrained facial video dataset (WVU) and the unconstrained facial video dataset (HONDA/UCSD), resultedin a 99.17% and 97.14% Rank-1 recognition rates, respectively. The multimodal recognition accuracydemonstrates the superiority and robustness of the proposed approach irrespective of the illumination, nonplanarmovement, and pose variations present in the video clips even in the situation of missing modalities."

In the data pretreatment process, the data are standardized and 200 samples of each grade are randomly chosen to obtain a fault detection model. After that, the best matching unit (BMU) of each grade is confirmed by applying AE-SOM. The faults are determined based on each BMU.

The prognostic of the two shutdowns is detected, and the fault propagation pathway caused by the faulty variable was analyzed."

In particular, dementia care costs, including indirect costs such as increased care costs due to lost caregiver hours and caregivers, have grown exponentially over the years. In order to reduce these costs, it is urgent to introduce a management system to care for dementia patients. Therefore, this study proposes a sensor-based abnormal behavior detection system to manage dementia patients who live alone or in an environment where they cannot always take care of dementia patients. Existing studies were merely evaluating behavior or evaluating normal behavior, and there were studies that perceived behavior by processing images, not data from sensors. In this study, we recognized the limitation of real data collection and used both the auto-encoder, the unsupervised learning model, and the LSTM, the supervised learning model. Autoencoder, an unsupervised learning model, trained normal behavioral data to learn patterns for normal behavior, and LSTM further refined classification by learning behaviors that could be perceived by sensors. The test results show that each model has about 96% and 98% accuracy and is designed to pass the LSTM model when the autoencoder outlier has more than 3%. The system is expected to effectively manage the elderly and dementia patients who live alone and reduce the cost of caring."

The phenolic acids at 2.5 mM significantly suppressed the expression of hopP1, hrpA, and hrpL in the hrp/hrc gene cluster without growth retardation of Pst DC3000.

Since future network infrastructure will host real-time services requiring immediate satisfaction, the issue of high energy consumption will hinder the fullrealization of CRs. This means that to offer the required qualityof service (QoS) in an energy-efficient manner, resource management strategies need to allow for effective trade-offs between QoSprovisioning and energy saving. To address this issue, this paperfocuses on single base station (BS) management, where resourceconsumption efficiency is obtained by solving a dynamic resourceallocation (RA) problem using bipartite matching. A deep learning(DL) predictive control scheme is used to predict the traffic loadfor better energy saving using a stacked auto-encoder (SAE). Considered here was a base station (BS) processor with both processorsharing (PS) and first-come-first-served (FCFS) sharing disciplinesunder quite general assumptions about the arrival and service processes. The workload arrivals are defined by a Markovian arrivalprocess while the service is general. The possible impatience of customers is taken into account in terms of the required delays. Inthis way, the BS processor is treated as a hybrid switching system that chooses a better packet scheduling scheme between meanslowdown (MS) FCFS and MS PS. The simulation results presentedin this paper indicate that the proposed predictive control schemeachieves better energy saving as the traffic load increases, and thatthe processing of workload using MS PS achieves substantially superior energy saving compared to MS FCFS."

Underwater image enhancement using symmetrical autoencoder with synthesis datasets,2020,"['Underwater image enhancement', 'Deep learning', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Auto-encoder', 'Skip-connection']",,"The underwater images obtained using optical sensors, such as cameras, have low visibility and color distortion due to underwater environments. To enhance the visibility and color of underwater images, autoencoder-based convolutional neural networks are used recently; however, a basic autoencoder is not effective in color distortion and makes the result images noisy. In this study, we propose an autoencoder with skip-connection called symmetrical autoencoder (SAE) to improve the visibility and color distortion of underwater images. The proposal of this study is twofold: (i) to symmetrically add skip-connections that connect encoders to decoders throughout the network for reconstructing ability of decoders and (ii) to synthesize underwater datasets using an underwater image formation model to train the autoencoder effectively. Through the comparison with other approaches, we show that the proposed autoencoder outperforms them in PSRN, SSIM, and color difference for test datasets.
