Path optimization for marine vehicles in ocean currents using reinforcement learning,2016,,,"<P>This study proposes a path planning algorithm for marine vehicles based on machine learning. The algorithm considers the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and disturbance effects in ocean environments. The movements of marine vehicles are influenced by various physical disturbances in ocean environments, such as wind, waves, and currents. In the present study, the effects of ocean currents are the primary consideration. A kinematic model is used to incorporate the nonholonomic motion characteristics of a marine vehicle, and the reinforcement learning algorithm is used for path optimization to generate a feasible path that can be tracked by the vehicle. The proposed approach determines a near-optimal path that connects the start and goal points with a reasonable computational cost when the map and current field data are provided. To verify the optimality and validity of the proposed algorithm, a set of simulations were performed in simulated and actual ocean current conditions, and their results are presented.</P>",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

However, as of now, the programs supported by instructional reinforcement are almost about using the system to run the blended learning, but it is hard to find the programs to improve their competencies. Therefore, this study aims to figure out what constitutes teaching competency. The teaching competency of the blended learning is extracted from literatures and delphi survey. Specifically, the competency in the teaching preparation consists of instruction design. The competency associated with teaching operation is crucial and necessary in the blended learning. It is made up of eight competencies such as their leadership, facilitation, communication, teaching presence, collective intelligence, digital literature, and creativity, fairness evaluationㆍpositive feedback. Lastly, the attitude of professors constitutes two kinds of abilities containing their respect for students and their passion, which are not directly related to teaching. That is, the total number of eleven competencies and thirty-two infrastructures is made from this process. Therefore, the teaching competency developed in this study offer the information about which parts of it should be strengthened by the instructors to successfully settle down the blended learning. Moreover, the result can allow the instructors to reflect on their teaching, and allow the teams of teaching support to provide proper educational programs according to their level of competencies.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
Teaching learning-based optimization for design of cantilever retaining walls,2016,"['cantilever retaining wall', 'reinforced concrete structures', 'Teaching-Learning Based Optimization (TLBO)', 'optimum design']",,"A methodology based on Teaching Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm is proposed for optimum design of reinforced concrete retaining walls. The objective function is to minimize total material cost including concrete and steel per unit length of the retaining walls. The requirements of the American Concrete Institute (ACI 318-05-Building code requirements for structural concrete) are considered for reinforced concrete (RC) design. During the optimization process, totally twenty-nine design constraints composed from stability, flexural moment capacity, shear strength capacity and RC design requirements such as minimum and maximum reinforcement ratio, development length of reinforcement are checked. Comparing to other nature-inspired algorithm, TLBO is a simple algorithm without parameters entered by users and self-adjusting ranges without intervention of users. In numerical examples, a retaining wall taken from the documented researches is optimized and the several effects (backfill slope angle, internal friction angle of retaining soil and surcharge load) on the optimum results are also investigated in the study. As a conclusion, TLBO based methods are feasible.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
Ubiquitous testing using tablets: its impact on medical student perceptions of and engagement in learning,2016,"['Educational measurement', 'Multimedia', 'Ubiquitous testing', 'Assessment']",,"Purpose: Ubiquitous testing has the potential to affect medical education by enhancing the authenticity of the assessment using multimedia items. This study explored medical students’ experience with ubiquitous testing and its impact on student learning. Methods: A cohort (n=48) of third-year students at a medical school in South Korea participated in this study. The students were divided into two groups and were given different versions of 10 content-matched items: one in text version (the text group) and the other in multimedia version (the multimedia group). Multimedia items were delivered using tablets. Item response analyses were performed to compare item characteristics between the two versions. Additionally, focus group interviews were held to investigate the students’ experiences of ubiquitous testing. Results: The mean test score was significantly higher in the text group. Item difficulty and discrimination did not differ between text and multimedia items. The participants generally showed positive responses on ubiquitous testing. Still, they felt that the lectures that they had taken in preclinical years did not prepare them enough for this type of assessment and clinical encounters during clerkships were more helpful. To be better prepared, the participants felt that they needed to engage more actively in learning in clinical clerkships and have more access to multimedia learning resources. Conclusion: Ubiquitous testing can positively affect student learning by reinforcing the importance of being able to understand and apply knowledge in clinical contexts, which drives students to engage more actively in learning in clinical settings.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

According to the integrated analysis of related laws, 2015 Revised Curriculum, and pilot school reports, the Free Learning Semester would not be likely to bring forth expected results because of the broadness of nationwide application to all junior high schools and the lack of preparation and time. In spite of some sore points about the Free Learning Semester, it has the potential to transform the current junior high school into a desirable middle school as seen in the Middle School Movement in the USA. For this policy to succeed in the Korean context, it must be charged in the form of specially designated local schools, such as alternative schools taking after the independent Free school or Eftersckole in Denmark. Ireland`s Transition Year also strongly suggests that a limited number of students want an individually prescribed curriculum and career-exploring experience at middle school level. If we can compromise and synthesize the advantages of the three policies of the USA`s Middle School Movement, Denmark`s Eftersckole, and Ireland`s Transition Year, the Free Learning Semester will have authentic power to transform junior high schools into middle schools.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

조용기 목사의 능력대결,2016,"['능력대결', '교회성장', '조용기', '신유기도', '내적강화', '영적전쟁', 'Power Encounter', 'Church Growth', 'Cho Yonggi', 'Prayer of Healing', 'Internal Reinforcement', 'Spiritual Warfare']","능력대결(power encounter)이라는 단어는 알렌 티펫(Alan Tippett) 선교사가 남태평양 제도에 있던 부족을 집단개종 운동을 설명한 책에서 사용되기 시작했다. 능력대결에 대해서 성경에는 에베소서 6:10-19에 잘 나타나 있다. 특히 12절은 “우리의 씨름은 혈과 육에 대한 것이 아니요 정사와 권세와 이 어두움의 세상 주관자들과 하늘에 있는 악의 영들에게 대함이다.”라고 말하고 있다. 이러한 배경 하에서 한국교회의 성장을 위해 영산의 능력대결에 대해 두 가지로 제시하였다. 첫째, 신유의 기도이다. 영산의 사역의 특징 가운데 신유의 기도를 빼놓을 수 없다. 영산은 설교를 마치고 기도의 시간에 신유의 기도를 통해서 성도들에게 은혜를 부여하고 있다. 영산의 이러한 사역은 성경의 신유 사건을 절대적으로 믿는 믿음과 함께 예수님의 신유 명령이 시대를 초월하여 성취될 수 있다는 확신 속에서 선포되는 것이다. 사단과의 영적 전쟁에서 하나님의 능력대결(Power Encounter)에서의 승리는, 눈에 보이는 신유와 축사 등의 오순절적 성령 사역의 승리로 경험케 된다면, 기독교 수용에 있어서 매우 용이하게 하는 것이 된다. 둘째, 지속적인 능력대결의 승리를 위한 내적강화이다. 영산의 특징적인 영적전쟁의 원리 가운데 ‘내적강화의 원리’는 능력대결을 위한 그리스도인의 내적 성장과 성숙, 내면 강화를 통해 지속적인 승리의 삶을 유지하도록 하기 위한 매우 중요한 원리이다. 이 세상에는 아직도 죄악이 관영하고, 악한 영적 세력들이 활동하고 있으며, 그리스도인들에게도 타락한 본성이 공존하고 있다. 영산은 그의 선교와 목회 현장 가운데 일관된 설교와 가르침의 사역을 통해 성도를 무장시켰다. 그것은 좋으신 하나님이 보내신 예수 그리스도의 십자가를 믿음으로 얻는 의, 성령충만, 치료, 축복, 영생의 오중복음과 영혼, 범사, 육체가 잘되는 삼중축복의 메시지였으며 그리스도인의 새로운 정체성, 자화상, 신분과 지위, 그리고 4차원의 영성을 통한 성령과의 동행 등에 관한 지속적인 가르침이었다. 영산의 능력대결 사역은 탁월하다. 그의 신앙은 성경적인 배경을 가지고 있으며, 이것을 목회 현장과 선교 현장에 잘 접목한 훌륭한 사례이다. 그의 교회성장은 능력대결을 통한 싸움에서의 승리의 결과이다. 지금 한국교회는 심각한 상황이다, 교회성장은 멈추었고 오히려 세상으로부터 비난의 대상이 되었다. 이러한 때에 선교사들과 목회자들은 능력대결에 대한 예비 훈련과 여러 성경적 원리들을 배워서 교회성장을 이루어야 할 것이다.","The word ‘Power Encounter’ began to be used in the book described the collective conversion movement written by Allan Tippett, who was a missionary in South Pacific. The Power Encounter in Ephesians 6:10-19, especially verse 12 says “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” Based on this background, Rev. Cho presented two ways about the Power Encounter for the growth of the Church in Korea. Firstly, the prayer of healing represents one of the features of Rev. Cho’s ministry. The saints have been blessed through the prayer of healing after the sermon. Rev. Cho’s ministry fulfilled Jesus’healing commands with absolute faith in the healing events of the Bible which have been achieved through the ages. If people experienced victory in the spiritual warfare against Satan with God’s Power Encounter and saw the healing events of the Holy Spirit through the Pentecostal ministry, it would be easier for them to accept Christianity. Secondly, it is important to strengthen the internal capacity of an ongoing battle for victory. Among those distinctive spiritual warfare principles of Rev. Cho, “the principle of internal reinforcement” is a very important principle to maintain a life of constant victory through internal growth and maturity, inner strengthening of the capacity of Christians. The world is still filled with sins, evil spiritual forces are active and even Christians have the nature of corruption. Saints were armed with his consistent preaching and teaching ministry such as, the righteous through faith on the cross of Jesus Christ who was sent by good God, filled with the Holy Spirit, healing, blessings, the ‘Fivefold Gospel’of eternal life and the ‘Threefold Blessing’of soul, body and everything. Also there was ministry about the new identity, selfportrait, status and the continuous teachings about walking with the Holy Spirit through the Spirituality of Fourth Dimension. The Power Encounter Ministry of Rev. Cho is excellent. His faith has a Biblical background. This is a great example of a well incorporated into the pastoral scene and the mission field. Church growth is a result of the victory in the fight through the Power Encounter. Now South Korea is in a serious situation. Church growth has stopped and Korean church has become a target of criticism from the world. This is the time for missionaries and pastors to start preliminary training of the Power Encounter and learn biblical principles for the healthy growth of Korean church.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that cultural artistic education in the childhood as “embodied experiences” was an important factor that makes it possible to choose diverse institutions related to culture, so this researcher presented that it is important to learn by composing the cultural artistic education in the childhood as general institutionalization. Also, since 3 out of 4 parameters presented as “institutionalized experiences” were the variables that reinforce cultural desires, this researcher presented the importance of diverse institutions and channels, and since experiences of using media had greater effects than any other parameters, this researcher proposed that diverse media to enjoy cultural contents and diverse opportunities to utilize the media should be institutionally reinforced.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Separated class students of the Division of International Studies, Ewha Womans University entered the university through integrated examinations(regular·non-scheduled) but they have characteristics as overseas South Korean learner. They are differentiated from both local learners and foreign learners and they show differences in Korean language ability, in particular, in reading and writing abilities by individual within the same separated class. However, Ewha Womans University operates this separated class with the same teaching materials and curricula as those of other separated classes (local learner) and applies the same evaluation system. However, given the learner characteristics of separated class students of the Division of International Studies, different writing education methods by college and by level are necessary for them.Therefore, in the present study, interviews in writing with major professors of the Division of International Studies as well as interviews with students were conducted. According to the results, the interviewees strongly revealed demands for practical expression ability rather than logical reasoning ability in writing classes for new students. In particular, they emphasized the necessity of basic knowledge to write and read scientific writings while requesting to prepare education methods and evaluation criteria considering level differences among learners.To understand the characteristics of students of the Division of International Studies as overseas South Korean learners and identify differences by level, in the present study, errors in sentence layers were analyzed. The types and frequencies of errors that appeared in the writings of students in the separated class of the Division of International Studies and those of students in other separated classes were compared and according to the results, the students in the separated class of the Division of International Studies particularly showed many errors related to the sentence structures of Korean language (errors in compliance of sentence components and errors in the use of postpositions or endings) as well as errors in writing styles(translation style, colloquial style expression). In addition, the numbers of times errors were compared among students within the separated class of the Division of International Studies and according to the results, differences in sentence constructing ability were large among the students. Therefore, the current class operation method and education method that do not consider the learner characteristics of students of the Division of International Studies and differences in learning ability among the students should be improved.

The results of the study shows that among the activities of a learning organization, independent variables in this study, promoting inquiry and dialogue as well as encouraging collaboration and team learning affect burnout. In other words, the dedication of an organization to creating a culture in which various learning approaches are experimented through questioning and giving feedback as well as collaborative learning that can reinforce the effective use of team resources have an impact on reducing emotional exhaustion, which is considered to be at the core of burnout. Plus, these factors reduce impersonalization, which is activated to prevent further emotional exhaustion by dealing with customers, colleagues and jobs in a cold, negative and perfunctory way. In this study, the dimensions of promoting inquiry and dialogue as well as encouraging collaboration and team learning were found to reduce the decline in personal sense of achievement of an employee with a negative assessment of himself or herself derived from a lack of achievement in his or her job. Supervisor trust (integrity, benevolence and ability) had a moderating effect on the relationship between strategic learning leadership and impersonalization/emotional exhaustion. This suggests that the trust of supervisor helps mediate and moderate the emotional exhaustion and impersonalization of organizational members by encouraging leaders to drive change and take the organization to a new direction. The study has provided implications that communication plays an important role in reducing burnout in the learning context such as positive, appreciative inquiry and feedback analysis to identify strength, and that supervisor trust is critical in order to ensure strategic learning leadership exerts greater influence on the organization.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Second, in a comparison between the overall level of importance and the effectiveness of implementation of transition education programs, teachers responded that the latter was significantly lower than the former. Third, in terms of difficulties in implementing transition education, teachers pointed towards quite a few factors: a lack of cooperation and support from related agencies and local companies, a dearth of employment opportunities for individuals without disability welfare cards, local companies"" negative attitudes towards employing people with learning disabilities, students"" lack of desire for employment, a lack of facilities and equipment for transition education in schools, and a lack of cooperation from parents. Fourth, concerning major directions for improvement, teachers suggested reinforcement of cooperation and connections with local companies and employment-related agencies, resolution of disadvantages in employment for those without disability welfare cards, employment of transition education specialists in schools, development and implementation of field-centered transition programs, an increase in transition service support centers and transition education special coordinators. Conclusion: It is expected that the government or related agencies will use the results from this study to develop policies to improve transition outcomes for students with learning disabilities.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

After Anderson et al. (2003) proposed that sticky costs result from the agency problem, Chen et al. (2012) provided empirical evidence that empire-building incentives arising from the agency problem move the sales, general, and administrative (SG&A) cost asymmetry away from its optimal level. Balakrishnan and Gruca (2008), Kama and Weiss (2012), and Dierynck et al. (2012) insisted through case studies that sticky costs are derived from managers` private incentives. Balakrishana et al. (2014) provided related evidence by focusing on short-run managerial incentives. A recently popular stream of the literature (i.e., Banker and Chen, 2006a; Banker and Byzalov, 2013; Banker et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013; Banker et al., 2014) adopted an explanation for managerial expectations, as first noted by Anderson et al. (2003), which stated that SG&A stickiness could intensify during periods of economic growth. Recently, behavioral finance and accounting researchers have become interested in the implications of managerial overconfidence for managers` decision-making. Overconfidence is a well-documented phenomenon in psychology (Allen and Evans, 2005). In particular, managerial overconfidence and optimism has had popular appeal as an explanation for asymmetric cost behavior (e.g., Banker and Chen, 2006a; Banker and Byzalov, 2013; Banker et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013; Banker et al., 2014; Yang, 2015). Banker et al. (2014) explain a complex pattern of sticky costs by combining two opposing processes (cost stickiness conditional on a prior sales increase and cost anti-stickiness conditional on a prior sales decrease) that reflect the structure of optimal decisions and the impact of managers` optimism. Chen et al. (2013) describe that SG&A cost stickiness increases as the degree of managerial overconfidence increases. Yang (2015) describe that optimistic bidder CEOs who overestimate the merged firm`s growth induce greater cost stickiness. This study aims to complement the behavioral accounting literature on the impact of managerial optimistic biases on resource allocation decisions. The primary studies in this area focused on the effect of managerial incentives on sticky costs as a managerial expectation explanation (e.g., Banker and Chen, 2006a; Banker and Byzalov, 2013; Banker et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013; Banker et al. 2014). In particular, the rapidly growing literature aforementioned (e.g., Chen et al., 2013; Yang, 2015) suggested an overconfidence explanation for sticky costs from the behavioral perspective. In this context, we examine the impact of managerial optimistic bias on sticky cost behavior by using Lin et al. (2005)`s measure as a proxy of the managerial optimism. Hence, the proxy of the managerial optimism employed by Lin et al. (2005) may fail to reflect time interval between forecastingand actual period. To mitigate this problem, we employ the difference between management`- and analyst`s sales forecast as a managerial optimistic bias. Further, we additionally adopt the measure of strong managerial optimism reinforced by learning and self-attribution bias. We first predict that managers who overestimate growth of future sales due to a bias related to miscalibration and the better-than-average effect are more patient with retaining unused capacity when sales decrease than do rational managers. This patience results in greater stickiness of committed costs. For the next stage, we expect that the optimistic managers who experience greater prior performance are more likely to retain unused slack when subsequent future sales decrease, as opposed to the managers who experience lower performance. This may be because successful managers assess the probability of realizing their optimistic expectations of growth more greatly owing to learning and the self-attribution bias. The results show that the cost stickiness in firms with optimistic managers exceeds that of firms with rational managers. Further, the degree of the cost stickiness in firms with optimistic managers grows even stronger with prior better performance. These are also consistent with alternative robust tests. We contribute to several streams of the literature. First, we complement the literature on sticky costs as an explanation for managerial expectation by examining―from an angle other than rational expectation―the effect of managerial optimistic bias that surpasses that of general managers on inelastic cost structure or over-slack resources. Finally, we contribute to the growing body of the behavioral accounting literature by adopting the difference between management`- and analyst`s forecast as a managerial optimistic bias, thus remedying the time interval problem of Lin et al. (2005)`s measure.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

It is necessary because the Christian universities should find a way to cope with the university restructuring strongly driven by the government and strengthen educational competitiveness. The evangelical personality education can realize a distinctive and excellent Christian education, which should foster the spirituality incarnating the kingdom of God. The incarnational spirituality education aims at a holistic, integrated education, not restricted to a cognitive learning, but leading to a comprehensive learning - knowing, sharing, and practicing the values of the Gospel while cultivating religious personality and moral character. Nurturing the spirituality purposes to establish a right relationship with God to develop self-esteem, community values, and responsibility for neighbor, society, nature, and the world. It is the incarnational spirituality education to infiltrate the values of the Gospel such as truth, love, and service into the whole personality. It will transform the whole person to forge links with neighbor, local community, and glocal society and help to realize on earth the core value of the kingdom of God, that is, shalom encompassing justice, peace, and love. The incarnational spirituality education can be argued on the theological bases supported by H. Richard Niebuhr’s model of the Gospel transforming culture, Johannes F. Hoekendijk’s idea of missio dei, Theo Sundermeier’s missiological concept of Konvivenz, Thomas H. Groome’s educational theory of conation, and William A. Linton’s ideal of the Christian university. This paper suggests how to practice the incarnational spirituality education, presenting cases and examples of the Christian universities in Korea. The incarnational spirituality education should include first, culture-transforming education correlating faith with learning; secondly, holistic, practical education enabling the whole personality to know, share, practice the values of the Gospel; thirdly, communal and glocal education transcending the self to participate in community and facilitate the realization of shalom in the glocal society; finally but not least, mutual relational education between professors and students through personal meeting and communal life sharing. The success of the alternative evangelical education will rely on the best use of curricular courses, extra-curricular activities, and efficient educational systems that the Christian university will make.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

In the context of school violence, most students are bystanders. They can either reinforce the violence or stop the violence. We hypothesized that the students who know their own temperament dimensions such as novelty seeking, harm avoidance, and reward dependence (Cloninger, 1994) will show more tendencies to defend victims from school violence when they learned the methods to prevent school violence in accordance to their temperament dimensions. 351 Korean middle school students participated the 4 sessions of school violence prevention program. The students completed the questionnaires to identify their own behavior in school violence situations. In the experimental group(temperament group), students learned the methods to help the victims that suits with their own temperaments. Whereas, the comparison group just attend the class regardless of their temperaments. Both groups showed significant increase in the trend of defending the victims. However, the temperament group showed more tendency to protect/defend the victims than the comparison group when they faced with school violence.

Findings revealed that the participants possessed a general understanding of EFL strategy use, and were able to improve their reading skills. However, overall practice of strategy use was limited due to the lack of adherence to effective individualized self-study practices and the restricted in-class opportunities to learn and reinforce applicable strategies. In addition, surveys and interviews identified further limitations associated with time restrictions, student workload, and graded requirements for the university entrance exam. These limitations indicated that the application of strategies was less likely to occur in public education and more acceptable in commercial non-graded academic institutes and private settings.

It is the story analysis of the 7 founding parents who are still involved in BoG at each school, asking the motivation of their engagement, the characteristic of local community and the orientation of each integrated school. The NI integrated education movement concludes as such. Firstly, it is characterized as the peace education beyond the sectarian division being driven by ordinary parents in the community, because most of NI school system used to legalize and reinforce the existing divided system of religion in the society. Secondly, the NI integrated education, seen as middle class-driven educational agenda, was set up as one of national educational sectors in which the whole school running cost should be covered by the national finance and thus was open free to the all children. Thirdly, there are many parents who have become lifelong learners themselves, transforming their communities more peacefully and tolerantly on the way to school creation. As a consequence the role of parents of integrated education movement is to be evaluated as a meaningful contribution of peace process in the divided NI society by becoming lifelong learners for transforming the society.

Results: The students’ academic stress had a significant impact on their depression (β=.279). The moderating effects of academic resilience did not have a significant impact, which is presumably as a result of there being more complex, nonlinear effects, rather than a simple, linear relationship between academic stress and resilience. Conclusion: It may be incorrect to assume that academic resilience is a moderating variable that lessens academic stress. It is implied that academic resilience can have a significant impact when internal and external support conditions are met, and that the effects can be reinforced when family support, a learning environment, and improved adaptability to life at school are also provided.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

One is the influence of the mega-discourses combined with educational purposes on the interpretation of historical facts, commonly found in East Asia in the discourses focused on nation-states. In Korea, the inclination to nation-state has been maintained as an important frame in history education, continuously impacting history interpretations. A case in point was the issues surrounding the Four Commanderies of the Han in the Korean ancient history. In response to the inclination, discussions on East Asian history started followed by the incorporation of East Asian history into the curriculum. However, it seems that the strong educational motivation within the discussions act as a limitation.  The other is the emphasis on the importance of liberal education from a pragmatic perspective. One of the discontents of history educators about the third version of the curriculum is the new objective called “reinforcement of educational capabilities.” This new target, combined with the goal of reducing the load of learning, has a risk of distorting the process of handing over the knowledge on history. Therefore, the issue of liberal education must be handled in a cautious way.  If the educators and scholars share their perception on the current issues from a broader perspective, and if the educators enhance their understanding on the viewpoints of history education, these efforts will exert positive influences on each other’s research environment. However, it is also important to keep a healthy distance from public opinions, which can be biased due to excessive interest in the current issues.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

The reason for gaeban for the civilian officials was to keep their lives and status, and for the kings to protect their favorite civilian officials, as the military officials took power from the coup. However, gaeban was contrary to the consciousness of the people of Goryeo who revered the civilian officials. Therefore, if someone decided on gaeban, he was given a high office to reduce the sense of repulse to converting to the military class. Meanwhile, the military officials did not convert to the civilian class during the military regime.During the Yuan intervention period, gaeban was more active than during the military regime for the following reasons. First, gaeban was taken as a means to reinforce the numbers of military officials by converting the civilian officials to the military ones, after many military officials died from the war against the Mongol. Second, as the kings initiated politics by their close personal attendants, gaeban was exploited for its nature that enabled faster promotion than custom in order to prefer and nurture their personal attendants. Third, as the adoption of Neo-Confucianism established the mood for learning for intellectual righteousness, gaeban was attempted from the military class to the civilian class. As a result, mutual gaeban became active between both classes. However, whereas gaeban from the civilian to the military class required no condition whatsoever, gaeban from the military to the civilian class was possible only by passing state examination or some form of recognition of intellectual capacity. Also, while geaban from the civilian to the military class led to a higher office than before, gaeban from the military to the civilian class resulted in no difference in office rank before and after the change. Therefore, even during the Yuan intervention period, gaeban from the civilian to the military class was more frequent than geaban from the military to the civilian class.In the later period of Goryeo, holding a second office in the civilian and military classes was as active as gaeban. They were applied to different subjects：the high officials, who were able to promote their opinions on state affairs, were allowed to hold a second office in the civilian or military class, and the low officials, who could not offer their views on state affairs, were not allowed to do so. If a high civilian official seeks to be in charge of a military duty, or a high military official attempts to be in charge of a civilian duty, they were encouraged to gaeban. The reason for not allowing the officials below the seventh poom-rank to hold a second office in the civilian or military class was to keep in line with the purpose of the yangban system to focus on one’s own duties and class. In other words, gaeban was implemented for the purpose of applying the division of yangban and separation of the responsibilities minimally on the class in charge of administrative affairs.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

For this purpose I first analyzed the coexistent relation between the multicultural perspective which was included in the 2009 revised curriculum(called ``2011 revision period``)as an achievement standard by the government education policy, and the ethnocentrism as the internal perspective which logically conflicted with the multiculturalism. Also I identified that the ethnocentrism which had become the implicit organizing principle of the literature textbooks had to be evaluated critically, preceding the political-societal demands intruded at the stage of developing textbooks. From this argument I was able to expect three major conclusions as follows；1) integration and elimination of the achievement standards of curriculum caused by workload reductions policy makes more difficult to bring out and concrete the content elements for textbook development, 2) over-sophisticating fixation of the learning process in the textbook structure and formation would cause the standardization of teaching approach, and 3) canonism prioritizing the de-contextural and implicit reading attention in selection and arrangement of the literary works would be likely to remain as it was predicted large power outages. These aspects in the government authorized textbooks system were assessed as not having a positive effect or giving a good contribution to exalt the fundamental values like the diversity of literary education. So I proposed in this study an alternative solution that includes overall rearranging achievement standards between the ``Korean language arts`` and ``Literature`` subjects, providing reinforced authorization criteria for textbook diversification, and registering and applying recommended literary works into the curriculum.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

As the diplomatic relations between South Korea and the Soviet Union were broken off, the Korean government didn""t pay attention to Goryeoin, which are ethnic Koreans in this region. Although Korea established diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union later, there was no Korean policies geared toward these Overseas Koreans. In the Soviet Union, 12 Hangul schools were established. The strong zeal of the ethnic Koreans for learning Hangul that was the symbol of the identity of the Korean people was known to the region of Gwangju, South Jeolla Province, and a fund-raising campaign was conducted in 1991 in this area to found Gwangju Hangul schools in the Soviet Union.  Gwangju Hangul schools were established in six areas of the Soviet Union, and education was provided by Korean teachers and teachers who were Goryeoin. But five schools were shut down in the mid-1990s, and Tashkent Gwangju Hangul School changed its name. The locals in Gwangju, South Jeolla Province, contributed to the spread of Hangul education by founding Hangul schools from the early 1990s, which should have been done by the Korean government or the Overseas Korean Foundation that was established in 1997, but there are no records about Gwangju Hangul schools at present. The shutdown of Gwangju Hangul schools was rooted in discontinued financial aid and poor management. Now, there are some suggestions on the management of Hangul schools. First, even the smallest amount of financial support should be provided to run the schools. Second, a supporting system should be set up to ensure successful management. Third, the schools should be self-reliant enough. Fourth, there should be a cooperative network between Goryeoin organizations and Korean educational institutions.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

According to the results, Chinese classic poetry texts were mostly quatrains (絶句), the number was quite small, and interpretations of such poems were incomplete. In some of the textbooks, Chinese classic poetry was included merely for variety. Those involved in Chinese classic poetry education need to make more efforts to activate Chinese classic poetry education by examining the theories and practices of Chinese classic poetry education. That is, efforts should be made externally to increase the number of classes of the Classical Chinese curriculum, and internally to maximize the effects of Classical Chinese education through including more masterpieces of Chinese classic poetry.

This has not only affected individual women, but has also had an impact on women′s relationships with the realms of thought and history. For a significant period of time, only a few women from certain classes were educated; a number of talented women had to make every endeavor to prove, to themselves and to others, that they also had the ability to think independently for themselves.The characteristics of women′s lives and education in traditional Chinese society, as suggested in historical documents and other literature, differ slightly depending on the time period. In general, however, their lives were limited to the home, isolated from the decision-making processes in society, and educated only in preparation for their domestic duties.These characteristics of women′s lives in traditional Chinese society clearly suggest the form that women′s education took at the time. From ancient to modern times, women’s education was limited to the homemaking skills required for family life and the virtues needed to maintain the patriarchal family system.As such, the fact that women′s intellectual and affective development was basically sought only as a means to cultivate homemaking skills and womanly virtues in traditional societies is common throughout East Asian traditional societies in different eras. Women′s education allowed women to develop their abilities only insofar as they were related to homemaking, which was perceived to have socially inferior value, and not to develop their intellectual abilities related to the pursuit of theoretical knowledge.What is more, women were made to think of themselves as subjects with relatively inferior abilities. This caused them to consider their subordination to, and dependence on, men as a matter of fact, and thus did not offer them an opportunity to grow as autonomous subjects.From this perspective, in the end, traditional women′s education in East Asia reproduced and reinforced women′s subordinate position. It was far from the kind of education that could enable women to develop their human consciousness as independent individuals who seek self-awareness, dignity, freedom, and happiness.Bhikkhuni temples that women (that is, bhikkhunis) created, handed down, and developed for themselves nevertheless served as places where women learned to write and were able to study in traditional Chinese society.

The participants of this study were 13 full-time housewives who sent their only child under 36 months to childcare centers, and the data were generated through in-depth interviews. The findings of this study are as follows. In terms of the housewives’ experiences, first, the reasons why they sent their infants to childcare were 1) to have some “me-time”, 2) to escape from the difficulties of child-rearing, 3) to help their infants adjust to childcare centers as a preparation for their reemployment, and 4) since they gained sudden admission from the centers where they put their infants on the waiting list. Second, sending their infants to childcare gave the housewives 1) a feeling of freedom from child-rearing, 2) a feeling of satisfaction from what their infants were learning at the centers, but simultaneously 3) a feeling of guilty about not doing their duties as mothers. Third, during the time when their infants were at childcare centers, the housewives spent their time 1) by doing the housework, 2) by having some “me-time”, 3) by getting useful information on child-rearing, and 4) by preparing for their reemployment. In terms of the housewives’ thoughts, first, the housewives wanted the society 1) to view their childcare use with a more understanding, and 2) to provide more part-time jobs. Second, in terms of policy, the housewives hoped for 1) ensuring the consistency of childcare policy and reinforcing its focus on the key users, 2) enhancing the treatment and quality of childcare teachers, and 3) strengthening publicity and quality of childcare services. These findings imply not only the need for an enhanced focus on quality and consistency of future childcare policies, but also the need for societal understanding and support on the child-rearing of housewives as well as working couples.",reinforcement_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
Automated Scoring of L2 Spoken English with Random Forests,2016,"['automated scoring', 'L2 spoken English', 'learner corpus', 'random forests']",,"The purpose of the present study is to assess second language (L2) spoken English using automated scoring techniques. Automated scoring aims to classify a large set of learners` oral performance data into a small number of discrete oral proficiency levels. In automated scoring, objectively measurable features such as the frequencies of lexical and grammatical items are generally used as exploratory variables to predict oral proficiency levels, any of which can be used as a criterion variable in this study. We have chosen the NICT JLE Corpus, a corpus of 1,281 Japanese EFL learners` speech productions coded into nine oral proficiency levels (Izumi, Uchimoto, & Isahara, 2004). The nine oral proficiency levels were used as the criterion variables and linguistic features analyzed in Biber (1988) as explanatory variables. We employed random forests (Breiman, 2001), a powerful method for text classification and feature extraction, to predict oral proficiency. As a result of random forests with the out-of-bag error estimate, 60.11% of the productions were correctly classified. Compared to the baseline accuracy of the simplest possible algorithm of always choosing the most frequent level (37.63%), our random forests model improved prediction by 22.48 points. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient with human scoring was 0.85. Predictors that showed a clear discrimination of oral proficiency levels were tokens, types, and the frequency of nouns in the order of strength.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv
Object Classification Method Using Dynamic Random Forests and Genetic Optimization,2016,"['Object Classification', 'Random Forest', 'Genetic Algorithm', 'Classifier Ensemble']",,"In this paper, we proposed the object classification method using genetic and dynamic random forest consisting of optimal combination of unit tree. The random forest can ensure good generalization performance in combination of large amount of trees by assigning the randomization to the training samples and feature selection, etc. allocated to the decision tree as an ensemble classification model which combines with the unit decision tree based on the bagging. However, the random forest is composed of unit trees randomly, so it can show the excellent classification performance only when the sufficient amounts of trees are combined. There is no quantitative measurement method for the number of trees, and there is no choice but to repeat random tree structure continuously. The proposed algorithm is composed of random forest with a combination of optimal tree while maintaining the generalization performance of random forest. To achieve this, the problem of improving the classification performance was assigned to the optimization problem which found the optimal tree combination. For this end, the genetic algorithm methodology was applied. As a result of experiment, we had found out that the proposed algorithm could improve about 3~5% of classification performance in specific cases like common database and self infrared database compare with the existing random forest. In addition, we had shown that the optimal tree combination was decided at 55~60% level from the maximum trees.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv
Random Forest Model for Silicon-to-SPICE Gap and FinFET Design Attribute Identification,2016,"['Random forest', 'Attribute', 'Importance', 'Impact', 'SPICE', 'FinFET']",,"We propose a novel application of random forest, a machine learning–based general classification algorithm, to analyze the influence of design attributes on the silicon-to-SPICE (S2S) gap. To improve modeling accuracy, we introduce magnification of learning data as well as randomization for the counting of design attributes to be used for each tree in the forest. From the automatically generated decision trees, we can extract the so-called importance and impact indices, which identify the most significant design attributes determining the S2S gap. We apply the proposed method to actual silicon data, and observe that the identified design attributes show a clear trend in the S2S gap. We finally unveil 10nm key fin-shaped field effect transistor (FinFET) structures that result in a large S2S gap using the measurement data from 10nm test vehicles specialized for model-hardware correlation.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

Since false and missing rings are typical in beech trees, skeleton plots were created to enhance crossdating accuracy. Chronologies were observed for a total of 15 samples. Meteorological data for rainfall and air temperature were recorded at the Nowshahr Meteorological Station, located near the study sites. Results showed a signiﬁcant correlation between mean annual air temperature and radial growth (R D 0.54). Within the growing season, August temperatures reveal a signiﬁcant correlation with tree ring (R D 0.41) while the highest association was observed in the previous December (R D 0.44) and the least association was found in February (R D 0.31). Excluding March (R D 0.33), there appeared to be no signiﬁcant correlation between precipitation accumulated during and prior to the growing season and tree ring.

To effectively forecast forest fire occurrence, we developed a forest fire danger rating model using weather factors associated with forest fire in 2000yrs. Forest fire occurrence patterns were investigated statistically to develop a forest fire danger rating index using times series weather data sets collected from 76 meteorological observation centers. The data sets were used for 11 years from 2000 to 2010. Development of the national forest fire occurrence probability model used a logistic regression analysis with forest fire occurrence data and meteorological variables. Nine probability models for individual nine provinces including Jeju Island have been developed. The results of the statistical analysis show that the logistic models (p<0.05) strongly depends on the effective and relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall. The results of verification showed that the probability of randomly selected fires ranges from 0.687 to 0.981, which represent a relatively high accuracy of the developed model.

To predict corporate credit ratings better, various algorithms of machine learning have been proposed and applied. However, the algorithms have some limitations. First of all, they are unable to give a solution for which variables in the dataset should be considered as input variables to effectively predict a dependent variable. Also, they are easily exposed to overfitting and risk being affected by outliers and noise. In addition, they are required to tune their numerous parameters. Under this background, this study proposes the application of Random Forests(RF) to overcome the weakness of the traditional techniques. RF were designed by Leo Breiman, an American statistician and professor, and are an ensemble learning technique. This algorithm has both features originating from bagging algorithm, which is to extend a single decision tree to various decision trees, and from random input selection. The benefit of our proposed algorithm is free from an overfitting issue, and both noise and outliers in the dataset cannot have an effect on it. Thus, our model can yield high accuracy in forecasting corporate credit ratings. To validate the effectiveness of RF in predicting corporate credit ratings, we applied it to a real world dataset of corporate credit rating in Korea. The data that we used for this research consisted of various financial ratios of 1,295 corporations and their corporate credit ratings. To evaluate and compare our model with traditional methods, we used the following methods: MDA(Multiple Discriminant Analysis), ANN(Artificial Neural Network) and MSVM(Multiclass SVM). Each model’s performance was calculated by predictive accuracy based on training and validation.　Empirical results showed that RF outperforms other traditional methods from the perspective of prediction accuracy.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

Downscaling of AMSR-E soil moisture with MODIS products using machine learning approaches,2016,,,"<P>Passive microwave remotely sensed soil moisture products, such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) data, have been routinely used to monitor global soil moisture patterns. However, they are often limited in their ability to provide reliable spatial distribution data for soil moisture due to their coarse spatial resolutions. In this study, three machine learning approaches-random forest, boosted regression trees, and Cubist-were examined for the downscaling of AMSR-E soil moisture (25 9 25 km) data over two regions (South Korea and Australia) with different climatic characteristics using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products (1 km), including surface albedo, land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Leaf Area Index, and evapotranspiration (ET). Results showed that the random forest approach was superior to the other machine learning models for downscaling AMSR-E soil moisture data in terms of the correlation coefficient [r = 0.71/0.84 (South Korea/Australia) for random forest, 0.75/0.77 for boosted regression trees, and 0.70/0.61 for Cubist] and root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.049/0.057, 0.052/0.078, and 0.051/0.063, respectively) through cross-validation. The ET and LST were identified as the most influential among the six input parameters when estimating AMSR-E soil moisture for South Korea, while ET, albedo, and LST were very useful for Australia. In overall, the downscaled soil moisture with 1 km resolution yielded a higher correlation with in situ observations than the original AMSR-E soil moisture data. The latter appeared higher than the downscaled data in forested areas, possibly due to the overestimation of soil moisture by passive microwave sensors over forests, which implies that downscaling can mitigate such overestimation of soil moisture.</P>",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

However, it is difficult to measure physiological signal, and eye tracking requires complex experiment equipment. As a result, driving information is adopted for drowsy driving detection. In order to achieve this purpose, driving experiment is performed for obtaining driving information through driving simulator. Moreover, this paper investigates effects of using different input parameter combinations, which is consisted of lateral acceleration, longitudinal acceleration, and steering angles with different time window sizes (i.e. 4 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 60 s), on drowsy driving detection using random forest algorithm. 20 s-size datasets using parameter combination of accelerations in lateral and longitudinal directions, compared to the other combination cases of driving information such as steering angles combined with lateral and longitudinal acceleration, steering angles only, longitudinal acceleration only, and lateral acceleration only, is considered the most effective information for drivers’ drowsy behavior detection.

Seventy percent of species showed low frequency distribution and species having higher frequency classes were almost absent or represented by only a few species. Dominance distribution of species resulted in a log normal distribution pattern which further signifies that the forest community was heterogeneous in nature. Species Prediction and Diversity Estimation analysis categorized 80% of the species as a rare species group and 20% as abundant species group. Estimation of coefficient of variation showed that rare species have equal detection possibilities in the sampled area.

To select the input column that affected the severity of the defect, we extracted the important defect factor of the data set using Random Forest (RF). We evaluated the performance of the model by changing the parameters in the 10-fold cross-validation. The evaluation results were as follows. First, defect severities were reclassified from 58, 40, 80 to 30, 20, 128. Second, BRANCH_COUNT was an important input column for the degree of severity in terms of accuracy and node impurities. Third, smaller tree number led to more variables for good performance.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

The current robot advisor recommends appropriate investment products after understanding the investment propensity based on the structured data entered directly or indirectly by individuals. However, it is an inconvenient and obtrusive way for financial consumers to inquire or input their own subjective propensity to invest. Hence, this study proposes a way to deduce the propensity to invest in unstructured data that customers voluntarily exposed during consultation or online. Since prediction performance based on unstructured document differs according to the characteristics of text, in this study, classification algorithm optimized for the characteristic of text left by financial consumers is selected by performing prediction performance evaluation of various learning discrimination algorithms and proposed an intelligent method that automatically recommends investment products. User tests were given to MBA students. After showing the recommended investment and list of investment products, satisfaction was asked. Financial consumers  satisfaction was measured by dividing them into investment propensity and recommendation goods.

Real-time Traffic Sign Recognition using Rotation-invariant Fast Binary Patterns,2016,"['Traffic sign recognition', 'rotation-invariant binary patterns', 'random forest', 'convolutional neural networks']",,"In this paper, we focus on recognition of speed-limit signs among a few types of traffic signs because speed-limit sign is closely related to safe driving of drivers. Although histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and local binary patterns (LBP) are representative features for object recognition, these features have a weakness with respect to rotation, in that it does not consider the rotation of the target object when generating patterns. Therefore, this paper propose the fast rotation-invariant binary patterns (FRIBP) algorithm to generate a binary pattern that is robust against rotation. The proposed FRIBP algorithm deletes an unused layer of the histogram, and eliminates the shift and comparison operations in order to quickly extract the desired feature. The proposed FRIBP algorithm is successfully applied to German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) datasets, and the results show that the recognition capabilities of the proposed method are similar to those of other methods. Moreover, its recognition speed is considerably enhanced than related works as approximately 0.47second for 12,630 test data.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

Practice of causal inference with the propensity of being zero or one: assessing the effect of arbitrary cutoffs of propensity scores,2016,"['causal inference', 'propensity score', 'positivity assumption', 'classification and regression tree', 'jackknife resampling', 'inverse propensity weighting', 'random forest']",,"Causal inference methodologies have been developed for the past decade to estimate the unconfounded effect of an exposure under several key assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the stable unit treatment value assumption, the strong ignorability of treatment assignment assumption, and the assumption that propensity scores be bounded away from zero and one (the positivity assumption). Of these assumptions, the first two have received much attention in the literature. Yet the positivity assumption has been recently discussed in only a few papers. Propensity scores of zero or one are indicative of deterministic exposure so that causal effects cannot be defined for these subjects. Therefore, these subjects need to be removed because no comparable comparison groups can be found for such subjects. In this paper, using currently available causal inference methods, we evaluate the effect of arbitrary cutoffs in the distribution of propensity scores and the impact of those decisions on bias and efficiency. We propose a tree-based method that performs well in terms of bias reduction when the definition of positivity is based on a single confounder.

A case study of spatial disaggregation of TRMM monthly precipitation data acquired over the Korean peninsula is carried out to illustrate the potential of the presented disaggregation method. From the evaluation results, the presented method outperformed the RF-based disaggregation method that only considers trend components and ignores residual components, in terms of accuracy statistics and the ability of coherent predictions. This case study indicates that accounting for residual components by applying a proper spatial prediction method such as area-to-point kriging is very important in spatial disaggregation of coarse scale spatial data, even though advanced regression models such as RF could have high goodness of fit for the quantification of relationships between a target attribute and auxiliary variables.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv
Estimation of Fractional Vegetation Cover in Sand Dunes Using Multi-spectral Images from Fixed-wing UAV,2016,"['FVC', 'Fixed-wing UAV', 'Multi-spectral Image', 'Sand Dune']",,"Since the use of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) is convenient for the acquisition of data on broad or inaccessible regions, it is nowadays used to establish spatial information for various fields, such as the environment, ecosystem, forest, or for military purposes. In this study, the process of estimating FVC (Fractional Vegetation Cover), based on multi-spectral UAV, to overcome the limitations of conventional methods is suggested. Hence, we propose that the FVC map is generated by using multi-spectral imaging. First, two types of result classifications were obtained based on RF (Random Forest) using RGB images and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) with RGB images. Then, the result map was reclassified into vegetation and nonvegetation.Finally, an FVC map-based RF were generated by using pixel calculation and FVC map-based GI (Gutman and Ignatov) model were indirectly made by fixed parameters. The method of adding NDVI shows a relatively h igher a ccuracy compared t o t hat of a dding only RGB, a nd i n particular, t he GI model shows a lower RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) with 0.182 than RF. In this regard, the availability of the GI model which uses only the values of NDVI is higher than that of RF whose accuracy varies according to the results of classification. Our results showed that the GI mode ensures the quality of the FVC if the NDVI maintained at a uniform level. This can be easily achieved by using a UAV, which can provide vegetation data to improve the estimation of FVC.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

Also, comparisons of the validation statistics among them were presented. To examine the seasonal sensitivities of the corn yields, three period groups were set up: (1) MJJAS (May to September), (2) JA (July and August) and (3) OC (optimal combination of month). In overall, the DL method showed the highest accuracies in terms of the correlation coefficient for the three period groups. The accuracies were relatively favorable in the OC group, which indicates the optimal combination of month can be significant in statistical modeling of crop yields. The differences between our predictions and USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) statistics were about 6-8 %, which shows the machine learning approaches can be a viable option for crop yield modeling. In particular, the DL showed more stable results by overcoming the overfitting problem of generic machine learning methods.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

Methods: 201,849 Health & Welfare related online documents from January 1 to March 31, 2016 from 171 Korean online channels and analyzed such documents using machine learning with random forest and Apriori algorithm association analysis. We used R software (version 3.2.1) for the association analysis data mining and visualization. Results: As for the prediction of future signals of health and welfare policies, policies that were important and supported by the people were welfare payment, health promotion, job, marriage/childbirth, health insurance, and healthcare industry (in this order). Specifically, as support for documents mentioning welfare payment and jobs was high, job creation through building a spontaneous welfare system is thought to be needed. Additionally, similar to the linkage analysis result of policies, as people were against documents that mentioned only {basic pension} policies, but supported documents that included {basic pension, welfare payment, job}, there is a strong demand for the establishment of a welfare system through active self-support and labor of the elderly. Conclusions: Social big data can be utilized in various areas. First, similar to the application in this study, future signals concerning government`s policies and new technologies can be predicted in advance and prepared for.

Object Classification based on Weakly Supervised E2LSH and Saliency map Weighting,2016,"['Object Classification', 'Bag of Visual Words', 'E2LSH', 'Graph-based Visual Saliency', 'Visual Language Model Method']",,"The most popular approach in object classification is based on the bag of visual-words model, which has several fundamental problems that restricting the performance of this method, such as low time efficiency, the synonym and polysemy of visual words, and the lack of spatial information between visual words. In view of this, an object classification based on weakly supervised E2LSH and saliency map weighting is proposed. Firstly, E2LSH (Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing) is employed to generate a group of weakly randomized visual dictionary by clustering SIFT features of the training dataset, and the selecting process of hash functions is effectively supervised inspired by the random forest ideas to reduce the randomcity of E2LSH. Secondly, graph-based visual saliency (GBVS) algorithm is applied to detect the saliency map of different images and weight the visual words according to the saliency prior. Finally, saliency map weighted visual language model is carried out to accomplish object classification.

Methods: Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane library) were queried for comparative studies on the two insertion techniques of gastrostomy among adults with swallowing disturbance. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate after gastrostomy insertion. Forest and funnel plots were generated for outcomes using STATA version 14.0. Results: Fifteen studies (n=2,183) met the inclusion criteria. PEG was associated with a lower risk of 30-day mortality after tube placement compared with RIG (odds ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.94; P =0.026).

Methods: Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochranelibrary) were queried for comparative studies on the two insertion techniques of gastrostomy among adults with swallowingdisturbance. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate after gastrostomy insertion. Forest and funnel plots weregenerated for outcomes using STATA version 14.0. Results: Fifteen studies (n=2,183) met the inclusion criteria. PEG was associatedwith a lower risk of 30-day mortality after tube placement compared with RIG (odds ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval[CI], 0.38–0.94; P =0.026). The pooled prevalence of 30-day mortality of PEG was 5.5% (95% CI, 4.0%–6.9%) and that of RIG was10.5% (95% CI, 6.8%–14.3%). No publication bias was noted. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis demonstrated that PEGis associated with a lower probability of 30-day mortality compared to RIG, suggesting that PEG should be considered as thefirst choice for long-term enteral tube feeding. Further prospective randomized studies are needed to evaluate and comparethe safety of these two different methods of gastrostomy.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

H. Wilson). We first modeled the distribution of Korean fir under current climate condition using five single-model species distribution models (SDMs) and the pre-evaluation weighted ensemble method and then predicted the distributions under future climate conditions projected with HadGEM2-AO under four CO2 emission scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5. We also investigated the predictive uncertainty stemming from five individual algorithms and four CO2 emission scenarios for better interpretation of SDM projections. Five individual algorithms were Generalized linear model (GLM), Generalized additive model (GAM), Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Generalized boosted model (GBM) and Random forest (RF). The results showed high variations of model performances among individual SDMs and the wide range of diverging predictions of future distributions of Korean fir in response to RCPs. The ensemble model presented the highest predictive accuracy (TSS = 0.97, AUC = 0.99) and predicted that the climate habitat suitability of Korean fir would increase under climate changes. Accordingly, the fir distribution could expand under future climate conditions. Increasing precipitation may account for increases in the distribution of Korean fir. Increasing precipitation compensates the negative effects of increasing temperature. However, the future distribution of Korean fir is also affected by other ecological processes, such as interactions with co-existing species, adaptation and dispersal limitation, and other environmental factors, such as extreme weather events and land-use changes. Therefore, we need further ecological research and to develop mechanistic and process-based distribution models for improving the predictive accuracy.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

GOCI 위성영상과 기계학습을 이용한 한반도 연안 수질평가지수 추정,2016,"['Water Quality Index', 'GOCI', 'machine learning']",,"In Korea, most industrial parks and major cities are located in coastal areas, which results in serious environmental problems in both coastal land and ocean. In order to effectively manage such problems especially in coastal ocean, water quality should be monitored. As there are many factors that influence water quality, the Korean Government proposed an integrated Water Quality Index (WQI) based on in situmeasurements of ocean parameters(bottom dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a concentration, secchi disk depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus) by ocean division identified based on their ecological characteristics. Field-measured WQI, however, does not provide spatial continuity over vast areas. Satellite remote sensing can be an alternative for identifying WQI for surface water. In this study, two schemes were examined to estimate coastal WQI around Korea peninsula using in situ measurements data and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite imagery from 2011 to 2013 based on machine learning approaches. Scheme 1 calculates WQI using estimated water quality-related factors using GOCI reflectance data, and scheme 2 estimates WQI using GOCI band reflectance data and basic products(chlorophyll-a, suspended sediment, colored dissolved organic matter). Three machine learning approaches including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a modified regression tree(Cubist) were used. Results show that estimation of secchi disk depth produced the highest accuracy among the ocean parameters, and RF performed best regardless of water quality-related factors. However, the accuracy of WQI from scheme 1 was lower than that from scheme 2 due to the estimation errors inherent from water quality-related factors and the uncertainty of bottom dissolved oxygen. In overall, scheme 2 appears more appropriate for estimating WQI for surface water in coastal areas and chlorophyll-a concentration was identified the most contributing factor to the estimation of WQI.",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

Real time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environments,2016,,,"<P>In recent years, the number of people using the Internet and network services is increasing day by day. On a daily basis, a large amount of data is generated over the Internet from zeta byte to petabytes with a very high speed. On the other hand, we see more security threats on the network, the Internet, websites, and the enterprise network. Therefore, detecting intrusion in such ultra-high-speed environment in real time is a challenging task. Many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are proposed for various types of network attacks using machine learning approaches. Most of them are unable to detect recent unknown attacks, whereas the others do not provide a real-time solution to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environment using Hadoop implementation. The proposed system includes four-layered IDS architecture, which consists of the capturing layer, filtration and load balancing layer, processing or Hadoop layer, and the decision-making layer. Furthermore, feature selection scheme is proposed that selects nine parameters for classification using (FSR) and (BER), as well as from the analysis of DARPA datasets. In addition, five major machine learning approaches are used to evaluate the proposed system including J48, REPTree, random forest tree, conjunctive rule, support vector machine, and Na < ve Bayes classifiers. Results show that among all these classifiers, REPTree and J48 are the best classifiers in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency. The proposed system architecture is evaluated with respect to accuracy in terms of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP), with respect to efficiency in terms of processing time and by comparing results with traditional techniques. It has more than 99 % TP and less than 0.001 % FP on REPTree and J48. The system has overall higher accuracy than existing IDSs with the capability to work in real time in ultra-high-speed big data environment.</P>",random_forest_2016_academic_riss.csv

Various parameters for MLP and SVM were considered. The measurement of prediction efficiency was done by the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). The experiments showed that the MLP with linear regression performs well overall, while the SVM with the polynomial kernel function based on the linear regression gives a low MAE and RMSE.

Although a number of studies showed that source-level EEG features can potentially be applied to the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia, most studies have used only sensor-level EEG features such as ERP peak amplitude and power spectrum for machine learning-based diagnosis of schizophrenia. In this study, we used both sensor-level and source-level features extracted from EEG signals recorded during an auditory oddball task for the classification of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. EEG signals were recorded from 34 patients with schizophrenia and 34 healthy controls while each subject was asked to attend to oddball tones. Our results demonstrated higher classification accuracy when source-level features were used together with sensor-level features, compared to when only sensor-level features were used. In addition, the selected sensor-level features were mostly found in the frontal area, and the selected source-level features were mostly extracted from the temporal area, which coincide well with the well-known pathological region of cognitive processing in patients with schizophrenia. Our results suggest that our approach would be a promising tool for the computer-aided diagnosis of schizophrenia.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

The employed classifiers in this research are: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To achieve this goal, the feature vectors extracted from image blocks are classified to perform a comparison between the efficiency of these methods for building material detection. The results indicate that for all three types of materials, SVM outperformed the other two techniques in terms of accurately detecting the material textures in images. The results also reveals that the common material detection algorithms perform very well in cases of detecting materials with distinct color and appearance (e.g., red brick); while their performance for detecting materials with color and texture variance (e.g., concrete) as well as materials containing similar color and appearance properties with other elements of the scene (e.g., ORB boards) might be less accurate.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

For these reasons, many researchers currently mainly focus on the brilliant machine learning-based prediction approaches for traffic prediction systems. This paper primarily addresses the analysis and comparison of prediction accuracy between two machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). Based on the fact that optimized estimation accuracy of these methods mainly depends on a large amount of recounted data and that they require much time to compute the same function heuristically for each action, we propose an approach that applies multi-threading to these heuristic methods. It is obvious that the greater the amount of historical data, the more processing time is necessary. For a real-time system, operational response time is vital, and the proposed system also focuses on the time complexity cost as well as computational complexity. It is experimentally confirmed that K-NN does much better than Naïve Bayes, not only in prediction accuracy but also in processing time.

Also, comparisons of the validation statistics among them were presented. To examine the seasonal sensitivities of the corn yields, three period groups were set up: (1) MJJAS (May to September), (2) JA (July and August) and (3) OC (optimal combination of month). In overall, the DL method showed the highest accuracies in terms of the correlation coefficient for the three period groups. The accuracies were relatively favorable in the OC group, which indicates the optimal combination of month can be significant in statistical modeling of crop yields.

In Wavelet Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (WK-ELM) structure, there are three adjustable parameters of wavelet kernel.

Extreme Learning Machine Approach for Real Time Voltage Stability Monitoring in a Smart Grid System using Synchronized Phasor Measurements,2016,"['Extreme learning machine', 'Loading margin', 'Voltage stability assessment', 'Phasor measurement unit']",,"Online voltage stability monitoring using real-time measurements is one of the most important tasks in a smart grid system to maintain the grid stability. Loading margin is a good indicator for assessing the voltage stability level. This paper presents an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) approach for estimation of voltage stability level under credible contingencies using real-time measurements from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). PMUs enable a much higher data sampling rate and provide synchronized measurements of real-time phasors of voltages and currents. Depth First (DF) algorithm is used for optimally placing the PMUs. To make the ELM approach applicable for a large scale power system problem, Mutual information (MI)-based feature selection is proposed to achieve the dimensionality reduction. MI-based feature selection reduces the number of network input features which reduces the network training time and improves the generalization capability.

An Automatic Diagnosis System for Hepatitis Diseases Based on Genetic Wavelet Kernel Extreme Learning Machine,2016,"['Pattern recognition', 'Wavelet Kernel (WK) based Extreme Learning Machines (ELM)', 'Genetic Algorithm (GA)', 'Classification accuracy', 'Sensitivity and specivity analysis', 'ROC curves', 'Hepatitis']",,"Hepatitis is a major public health problem all around the world. This paper proposes an automatic disease diagnosis system for hepatitis based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) Wavelet Kernel (WK) Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). The classifier used in this paper is single layer neural network (SLNN) and it is trained by ELM learning method. The hepatitis disease datasets are obtained from UCI machine learning database. In Wavelet Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (WK-ELM) structure, there are three adjustable parameters of wavelet kernel. These parameters and the numbers of hidden neurons play a major role in the performance of ELM. Therefore, values of these parameters and numbers of hidden neurons should be tuned carefully based on the solved problem. In this study, the optimum values of these parameters and the numbers of hidden neurons of ELM were obtained by using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The performance of proposed GA-WK-ELM method is evaluated using statical methods such as classification accuracy, sensitivity and specivity analysis and ROC curves. The results of the proposed GA-WK-ELM method are compared with the results of the previous hepatitis disease studies using same database as well as different database. When previous studies are investigated, it is clearly seen that the high classification accuracies have been obtained in case of reducing the feature vector to low dimension. However, proposed GA-WK-ELM method gives satisfactory results without reducing the feature vector. The calculated highest classification accuracy of proposed GA-WK-ELM method is found as 96.642 %.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Extreme Learning Machine Approach for Real Time Voltage Stability Monitoring in a Smart Grid System using Synchronized Phasor Measurements,2016,"['Extreme learning machine', 'Loading margin', 'Voltage stability assessment', 'Phasor measurement unit']",,"Online voltage stability monitoring using real-time measurements is one of the most important tasks in a smart grid system to maintain the grid stability. Loading margin is a good indicator for assessing the voltage stability level. This paper presents an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) approach for estimation of voltage stability level under credible contingencies using real-time measurements from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). PMUs enable a much higher data sampling rate and provide synchronized measurements of real-time phasors of voltages and currents. Depth First (DF) algorithm is used for optimally placing the PMUs. To make the ELM approach applicable for a large scale power system problem, Mutual information (MI)-based feature selection is proposed to achieve the dimensionality reduction. MI-based feature selection reduces the number of network input features which reduces the network training time and improves the generalization capability.

Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms for Class-Imbalanced Process Fault Detection Problems,2016,,,"<P>In recent years, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has recognized class imbalance as a major impediment to the development of high-performance fault detection (FD) models. Class imbalance refers to skews in class distribution in which normal wafer samples are considerably more abundant than fault samples. In such a situation, standard machine learning algorithms create FD models with classification boundaries that are biased toward majority-class data, resulting in high type II error rates. In this paper, we compare the performance of machine learning algorithms for class-imbalanced FD problems. We evaluate the performance of three sampling-based algorithms, four ensemble algorithms, four instance-based algorithms, and two support vector machine algorithms. Two experiments were conducted to compare algorithm performance using etching process data and chemical vapor deposition process data. Different data scenarios were considered by setting the imbalance ratio to three levels. The results of the experiments indicated that the instance-based algorithms presented excellent performance even when the imbalance ratio increased.</P>",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

"A hybrid feature selection algorithm integrating an extreme learning machine for landslide susceptibility modeling of Mt. Woomyeon, South Korea",2016,"['Extreme rainfall', 'GIS', 'Hybrid model', 'Landslide susceptibility']",,"<P>An ever-increasing trend of extreme rainfall events in South Korea owing to climate change is causing shallow landslides and debris flows in mountains that cover 70% of the total land area of the nation. These catastrophic, gravity-driven processes cost the government several billion KRW (South Korean Won) in losses in addition to fatalities every year. The most common type of landslide observed is the shallow landslide, which occurs at 1-3 m depth, and may mobilize into more catastrophic flow-type landslides. Hence, to predict potential landslide areas, susceptibility maps are developed in a geographical information system (GIS) environment utilizing available morphological, hydrological, geotechnical, and geological data. Landslide susceptibility models were developed using 163 landslide points and an equal number of nonlandslide points in Mt. Woomyeon, Seoul, and 23 landslide conditioning factors. However, because not all of the factors contribute to the determination of the spatial probability for landslide initiation, and a simple filter or wrapper-based approach is not efficient in identifying all of the relevant features, a feedback-loop-based hybrid algorithm was implemented in conjunction with a learning scheme called an extreme learning machine, which is based on a single-layer, feed-forward network Validation of the constructed susceptibility model was conducted using a testing set of landslide inventory data through a prediction rate curve. The model selected 13 relevant conditioning factors out of the initial 23; and the resulting susceptibility map shows a success rate of 85% and a prediction rate of 89.45%, indicating a good performance, in contrast to the low success and prediction rate of 69.19% and 56.19%, respectively, as obtained using a wrapper technique.

Downscaling of AMSR-E soil moisture with MODIS products using machine learning approaches,2016,,,"<P>Passive microwave remotely sensed soil moisture products, such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) data, have been routinely used to monitor global soil moisture patterns. However, they are often limited in their ability to provide reliable spatial distribution data for soil moisture due to their coarse spatial resolutions. In this study, three machine learning approaches-random forest, boosted regression trees, and Cubist-were examined for the downscaling of AMSR-E soil moisture (25 9 25 km) data over two regions (South Korea and Australia) with different climatic characteristics using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products (1 km), including surface albedo, land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Leaf Area Index, and evapotranspiration (ET). Results showed that the random forest approach was superior to the other machine learning models for downscaling AMSR-E soil moisture data in terms of the correlation coefficient [r = 0.71/0.84 (South Korea/Australia) for random forest, 0.75/0.77 for boosted regression trees, and 0.70/0.61 for Cubist] and root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.049/0.057, 0.052/0.078, and 0.051/0.063, respectively) through cross-validation. The ET and LST were identified as the most influential among the six input parameters when estimating AMSR-E soil moisture for South Korea, while ET, albedo, and LST were very useful for Australia. In overall, the downscaled soil moisture with 1 km resolution yielded a higher correlation with in situ observations than the original AMSR-E soil moisture data. The latter appeared higher than the downscaled data in forested areas, possibly due to the overestimation of soil moisture by passive microwave sensors over forests, which implies that downscaling can mitigate such overestimation of soil moisture.</P>",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
Intraoperative Diagnosis Support Tool for Serous Ovarian Tumors Based on Microarray Data Using Multicategory Machine Learning :,2016,,,"<P>Objectives Serous borderline ovarian tumors (SBOTs) are a subtype of serous ovarian carcinoma with atypical proliferation. Frozen-section diagnosis has been used as an intraoperative diagnosis tool in supporting the fertility-sparing surgery by diagnosing SBOTs with accuracy of 48% to 79%. Using DNA microarray technology, we designed multicategory classification models to support frozen-section diagnosis within 30 minutes. Materials and Methods We systematically evaluated 6 machine learning algorithms and 3 feature selection methods using 5-fold cross-validation and a grid search on microarray data obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. To validate the models and selected biomarkers, expression profiles were analyzed in tissue samples obtained from the Yonsei University College of Medicine. Results The best accuracy of the optimal machine learning model was 97.3%. In addition, 5 features, including the expression of the putative biomarkers SNTN and AOX1, were selected to differentiate between normal, SBOT, and serous ovarian carcinoma groups. Different expression levels of SNTN and AOX1 were validated by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. A multinomial logistic regression model using SNTN and AOX1 alone was used to construct a simple-to-use equation that gave a diagnostic test accuracy of 91.9%. Conclusions We identified 2 biomarkers, SNTN and AOX1, that are likely involved in the pathogenesis and progression of ovarian tumors. An accurate diagnosis of ovarian tumor subclasses by application of the equation in conjunction with expression analysis of SNTN and AOX1 would offer a new accurate diagnosis tool in conjunction with frozen-section diagnosis within 30 minutes.</P>",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

A Dynamic Channel Switching Policy Through P-learning for Wireless Mesh Networks,2016,"['Dynamic channel switching', 'machine learning', 'switching delay', 'WMN']",,"Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) based on IEEE 802.11s have emerged as one of the prominent technologies in multi-hop communications. However, the deployment of WMNs suffers from serious interference problem which severely limits the system capacity. Using multiple radios for each mesh router over multiple channels, the interference can be reduced and improve system capacity. Nevertheless, interference cannot be completely eliminated due to the limited number of available channels. An effective approach to mitigate interference is to apply dynamic channel switching (DCS) in WMNs. Conventional DCS schemes trigger channel switching if interference is detected or exceeds a predefined threshold which might cause unnecessary channel switching and long protocol overheads. In this paper, a P-learning based dynamic switching algorithm known as learning automaton (LA)-based DCS algorithm is proposed. Initially, an optimal channel for communicating node pairs is determined through the learning process. Then, a novel switching metric is introduced in our LA-based DCS algorithm to avoid unnecessary initialization of channel switching. Hence, the proposed LA-based DCS algorithm enables each pair of communicating mesh nodes to communicate over the least loaded channels and consequently improve network performance.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

In each scenario, participants are given opportunities to construct inquiries around physical and emotional health-related phenomena in their own community. Results: Participants formulated inquiries as well as potential clinical treatments and hypothetical scenarios to address health concerns or clarify misunderstandings or misdiagnoses often found in their community practices. From medical universities to rural village health promotion organizations, all participatory inquiries and potential solutions can be collected and analyzed. The inquiry and solution sets represent an evaluation vector which helps educators better understand community health issues at a much deeper level. Conclusions: SMILE helps collect problems that are most important and central to their community health concerns. The evaluation vector, consisting participatory and collective inquiries and potential solutions, helps the researchers assess the participants’ level of understanding on issues around health concerns and practices while helping the community adequately formulate follow-up action plans. The method used in SMILE requires much further enhancement with machine learning and advanced data visualization.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Support vector machine based fault detection approach for RFT-30 cyclotron,2016,"['Cyclotron', 'Fault detection', 'Support vector machine', 'Principal component analysis']",,"An RFT-30 is a 30MeV cyclotron used for radioisotope applications and radiopharmaceutical researches. The RFT-30 cyclotron is highly complex and includes many signals for control and monitoring of the system. It is quite difficult to detect and monitor the system failure in real time. Moreover, continuous monitoring of the system is hard and time-consuming work for human operators. In this paper, we propose a support vector machine (SVM) based fault detection approach for the RFT-30 cyclotron. The proposed approach performs SVM learning with training samples to construct the classification model. To compensate the system complexity due to the large-scale accelerator, we utilize the principal component analysis (PCA) for transformation of the original data. After training procedure, the proposed approach detects the system faults in real time. We analyzed the performance of the proposed approach utilizing the experimental data of the RFT-30 cyclotron.

First, the proposed method predicts whether the speech packet to be transmitted is lost. To this end, the proposed method learns the pattern of packet losses in the IP network, and then predicts the loss of the packet to be transmitted over that IP network. The proposed method classifies the speech signal into different classes of silence, unvoiced, speech onset, or voiced frame. Based on the results of packet loss prediction and speech classification, the proposed method determines the proper amount and bitrate of redundant speech data (RSD) that are sent with primary speech data (PSD) in order to assist the speech decoder to restore the speech signals of lost packets.Specifically, when a packet is predicted to be lost, the amount and bitrate of the RSD must be increased through a reduction in the bitrate of the PSD. The effectiveness of the proposed method for learning the packet loss pattern and assigning a different speech coding rate is then demonstrated using a support vector machine and adaptive multirate-narrowband, respectively. The results show that as compared with conventional methods that restore lost speech signals, the proposed method remarkably improves the perceived speech quality of an SW-based MCU under various packet loss conditions in an IP network.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Relationship Induced Multi-Template Learning for Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment,2016,,,"<P>As shown in the literature, methods based on multiple templates usually achieve better performance, compared with those using only a single template for processing medical images. However, most existing multi-template based methods simply average or concatenate multiple sets of features extracted from different templates, which potentially ignores important structural information contained in the multi-template data. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel relationship induced multi-template learning method for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), by explicitly modeling structural information in the multi-template data. Specifically, we first nonlinearly register each brain's magnetic resonance (MR) image separately onto multiple pre-selected templates, and then extract multiple sets of features for this MR image. Next, we develop a novel feature selection algorithm by introducing two regularization terms to model the relationships among templates and among individual subjects. Using these selected features corresponding to multiple templates, we then construct multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Finally, an ensemble classification is used to combine outputs of all SVM classifiers, for achieving the final result. We evaluate our proposed method on 459 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 97 AD patients, 128 normal controls (NC), 117 progressive MCI (pMCI) patients, and 117 stable MCI (sMCI) patients. The experimental results demonstrate promising classification performance, compared with several state-of-the-art methods for multi-template based AD/MCI classification.</P>",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Acceleration data were transformed to the feature vectors of principle component analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) and K-means clustering were used to classify sitting posture with the transformed feature vectors. To evaluate performance, we calculated the correct rate for each classification strategy. Although the correct rate of SVM in sitting back arch was lower than that of K-means clustering by 2.0%, SVM’s correct rate was higher by 1.3%, 5.2%, 16.6%, 7.1% in a normal posture, sitting front arch, sitting cross-legged, sitting leaning right, respectively.

This article introduces standardized interworking interfaces and procedures based on oneM2M global standards, and tests them through use cases involving multiple IoT service platforms. The interworking involves smart city applications/services running on multiple IoT service layer platforms interoperating with each other. The main purpose of the interworking experiment is to show how machine-to-machine (M2M)/IoT service providers are using oneM2M compliant service layer platforms to deliver services more efficiently across multiple technology domains such as smart city.

Methods : First, we reviewed the blood stasis(BS) questionnaires of Korean, Chinese, and Japanese version to make a integrated BS questionnaire of patient-reported outcomes. Through a human subject research, patients-reported BS symptoms data were acquired. Next, experts decisions of 5 Korean medicine doctor were also acquired, and supervised learning models were developed using multiple logistic regression and decision tree. Results : Integrated BS questionnaire with 24 items was developed. Multiple logistic regression models with accuracy of 0.92(male) and 0.95(female) validated by 10-folds cross-validation were constructed. By decision tree modeling methods, male model with 8 decision node and female model with 6 decision node were made. In the both models, symptoms of ‘recent physical trauma’, ‘chest pain’, ‘numbness’, and ‘menstrual disorder(female only)’ were considered as important factors. Conclusions : Because machine learning, especially supervised learning, can reveal and suggest important or essential factors among the very various symptoms making up a pattern identification, it can be a very useful tool in researching diagnostics of TKM. With a proper patient-reported outcomes or well-structured database, it can also be applied to a pre-screening solutions of healthcare system in Mibyoung stage.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

As an alternative model, conventional hidden Markov model (HMM) and modified hidden Markov model (mHMM) are used where additional information of transition probability between primary properties is incorporated in the predictions. In the comparisons, 16 boreholes consisted with four different materials are synthesized, which show directional non-stationarity in upward and downward directions. Futhermore, two types of the secondary information that is statistically related to each material are generated. From the comparative analysis with various case studies, the accuracies of the techniques become degenerated with inclusion of additive errors and small amount of the training data. For HMM predictions, the conventional HMM shows the similar accuracies with the models that does not relies on transition probability.

GOCI 위성영상과 기계학습을 이용한 한반도 연안 수질평가지수 추정,2016,"['Water Quality Index', 'GOCI', 'machine learning']",,"In Korea, most industrial parks and major cities are located in coastal areas, which results in serious environmental problems in both coastal land and ocean. In order to effectively manage such problems especially in coastal ocean, water quality should be monitored. As there are many factors that influence water quality, the Korean Government proposed an integrated Water Quality Index (WQI) based on in situmeasurements of ocean parameters(bottom dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a concentration, secchi disk depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus) by ocean division identified based on their ecological characteristics. Field-measured WQI, however, does not provide spatial continuity over vast areas. Satellite remote sensing can be an alternative for identifying WQI for surface water. In this study, two schemes were examined to estimate coastal WQI around Korea peninsula using in situ measurements data and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite imagery from 2011 to 2013 based on machine learning approaches. Scheme 1 calculates WQI using estimated water quality-related factors using GOCI reflectance data, and scheme 2 estimates WQI using GOCI band reflectance data and basic products(chlorophyll-a, suspended sediment, colored dissolved organic matter). Three machine learning approaches including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a modified regression tree(Cubist) were used. Results show that estimation of secchi disk depth produced the highest accuracy among the ocean parameters, and RF performed best regardless of water quality-related factors. However, the accuracy of WQI from scheme 1 was lower than that from scheme 2 due to the estimation errors inherent from water quality-related factors and the uncertainty of bottom dissolved oxygen. In overall, scheme 2 appears more appropriate for estimating WQI for surface water in coastal areas and chlorophyll-a concentration was identified the most contributing factor to the estimation of WQI.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

It, therefore, is very important to lower the total execution time of the simulation especially when that simulation makes a huge number of repetitions with varying values of input parameters. In this paper we develop a simulation service system that provides the ability to predict the result of the requested simulation without actual execution for that simulation: by recording and then returning previously obtained or predicted results of that simulation. To achieve the goal of avoiding repetitive simulation, the system provides two main functionalities: (1) storing simulation-result records into database and (2) predicting from the database the result of a requested simulation using statistical machine learning techniques. In our experiments we evaluate the prediction performance of the system using real airfoil simulation result data.

In the early stages of technological development, technological learning and entrepreneurship are efficient ways in which to catch up with advanced countries because firms can accumulate skills and knowledge quickly at relatively low risk. In the later stages of technological development, however, innovation and creativity become more impor-tant. This study aims to identify a) the factors (learning capabilities) that influence techno-logical learning performance and b) barriers to enhancing innovation capabilities for the creative economy and organizations. The major part of this study is related to learning capabilities in the post-catch-up era. Based on a literature review and observations from Korean experiences, this study proposes a technological learning model composed of various influencing factors on technological learning. Three hypotheses are derived, and data are collected from Korean machine tool manufacturers. Intense interviews with CEOs and R&D directors are conducted using structured questionnaires. Statistical analysis, such as correlation and ANOVA are then carried out. Furthermore, this study addresses how to enhance innovation capabilities to move forward. Innovation enablers and barriers are identified by case studies and policy analysis. The results of the empirical study identify several levels of firms’ learning capabilities and activities such as a) stock of technology, b) potential of technical labor, c) explicit technological efforts, d) readiness to learn, e) top management support, f) a formal technological learning system, g) high learning motivation, h) appropriate technology choice, and i) specific goal setting. These learning capabilities determine firms’ learning performance, especially in the early stages of development. Furthermore, it is found that the critical factors for successful technological learning vary along the stages of technology development. Throughout the statistical and policy analyses, this study confirms that technological learning can be understood as an intrinsic principle of the technology development process. Firms perform proactive and creative learning in the late stages, while reactive and imitative learning prevails in the early stages.

Artificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized. The Beginning of artificial intelligence is set in 1956. Watson, the artificial intelligence program created by I. B. M. is able to understand natural language queries and answer question. Machine Learning is the hot new phase of artificial intelligence. This has become practical only recently with the development of big data. Applying machine learning is a big switch from traditional police dispatching.The use of artificial intelligence to predict crime has only recently emerged. For example Predpol software is a powerful tool that allows law enforcement to shift from reactive to preventive policing. It’s algorithm uses advanced mathematics and machine learning to generate predictions using type, place, and time of past crimes. It is based on the idea that analyzing large amount of crime data, you can more accurately predict where and when crimes may happen.This article reviews the admissibility of predictive policing based on artificial intelligence. The standard rule on admissibility of new scientific evidence is Frye and Daubert test. But the reliability of machine learning should be differently assessed. The heart of machine learning is artificial neural network. Artificial neural network can learn, but acts as a black box. So artificial neural network can’t explain how it arrives at a particular solution. This opaqueness affects the admissibility of crime prediction based on machine learning. If we cannot see how the network derives its results it produces, we cannot accept the results. The validation of results is very important factor in admissibility of scientific evidence in criminal trials. But predictive policing based on artificial intelligence will impact reasonable suspicion analysis of police stop. Despite that predictive policing based on artificial intelligence lacks reliability and transparency, it provides legitimacy in police stop.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Contrary to traditional data which is typically stored in a relational database, big data varies in terms of volume, velocity, and variety. Big data is typically generated in large volumes. Big data comes from everywhere: social data, machine data and transactional data. Analytics has always involved attempts to improve decision making, and big data contributes that. Large organizations are seeking both faster and better decisions with big data, and Law enforcement also are seeking them. The big data trend promises that harnessing the wealth and volume of information leads to better operational efficiency, and competitive advantage. Traditional analytics tools are not well suited to capturing the full value of big data. Machine learning is ideal for unlocking hidden profits in big data. It fulfills the promise of extracting value from big data with less reliance on human intervention. It is well suited to the complexity of dealing with disparate data sources and the huge variety of variables and amounts of data involved. And unlike traditional analysis, machine learning thrives on growing datasets. The more data fed into a machine learning system, the more it can learn and apply the results to higher quality insights. One of the basic arguments in this article is extended enforcement of the digitalization of the criminal justice procedure. With the execution of Act on promoting the digitalization of the criminal justice procedure and Act on the use of electronic documents in summary procedures, A criminal justice agency shall store and keep decisions, indictments, warrants, records and other documents concerning criminal justice affairs by using their systems. The stored and kept data in this procedure is intrinsically characterized as Big data in terms of volume and variety. Byproducts of all this data are the new insights that can drive judicial decision making in new way. The new insights will contribute to a process of reform of our justice systems to render them more effective. In korea, substantial disparity in criminal sentencing is a critical issue. The Sentencing Guidelines were designed to eliminate this sentencing disparities. This article suggests that big data analytics will help to improve eliminating sentencing disparity and effective law-enforcement. This article presents the actuarial risk assessment instrument used to predict the risk of future dangerousness in United States. Actuarial method of risk assessment is designed to predict specific behaviors within a specific time frame. The stated goal of the actuarial method is to predict future dangerousness in a relative sense, by comparing an individual to a norm-based reference group. Big data analytics will also improve this actuarial risk assessment. This article also suggests Machine learning-based legal expert system that help judges explain why they decided that way. Since machine learning algorithm can be very good at detecting hard to observe relationship between data, it may be possible to detect obscured association between certain variables in criminal case and particular legal outcomes. Probably this expert system outperforms several experts in terms of predicting judicial outcomes.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Revisiting the Regression between Raw Outputs of Image Quality Metrics and Ground Truth Measurements,2016,,,"<P>In this paper, we aim to investigate the potential usefulness of machine learning in image quality assessment (IQA). Most previous studies have focused on designing effective image quality metrics (IQMs), and significant advances have been made in the development of IQMs over the last decade. Here, our goal is to improve prediction outcomes of 'any' given image quality metric. We call this the 'IQM's Outcome Improvement' problem, in order to distinguish the proposed approach from the existing IQA approaches. We propose a method that focuses on the underlying IQM and improves its prediction results by using machine learning techniques. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three different publicly available image databases. Particularly, through both 1) in-database and 2) cross-database validations, the generality and technological feasibility (in real-world applications) of our machine-learning-based algorithm have been evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves prediction outcomes of various existing commonly used IQMs (e.g., MSE, PSNR, SSIM-based IQMs, etc.) in terms of not only prediction accuracy, but also prediction monotonicity.</P>",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
Detection of tropical cyclone genesis via quantitative satellite ocean surface wind pattern and intensity analyses using decision trees,2016,"['Tropical cyclone', 'Microwave sea surface wind', 'Dynamic pattern and intensity recognition', 'Machine learning']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Microwave remote sensing can be used to measure ocean surface winds, which can be used to detect tropical cyclone (TC) formation in an objective and quantitative way. This study develops a new model using WindSat data and a machine learning approach. Dynamic and hydrologic indices are quantified from WindSat wind and rainfall snapshot images over 352 developing and 973 non-developing tropical disturbances from 2005 to 2009. The degree of cyclonic circulation symmetry near the system center is quantified using circular variances, and the degree of strong wind aggregation (heavy rainfall) is defined using a spatial pattern analysis program tool called FRAGSTATS. In addition, the circulation strength and convection are defined based on the areal averages of wind speed and rainfall. An objective TC formation detection model is then developed by applying those indices to a machine-learning decision tree algorithm using calibration data from 2005 to 2007. Results suggest that the circulation symmetry and intensity are the most important parameters that characterize developing tropical disturbances. Despite inherent sampling issues associated with the polar orbiting satellite, a validation from 2008 to 2009 shows that the model produced a positive detection rate of approximately 95.3% and false alarm rate of 28.5%, which is comparable with the pre-existing objective methods based on cloud-pattern recognition. This study suggests that the quantitative microwave-sensed dynamic ocean surface wind pattern and intensity recognition model provides a new method of detecting TC formation.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  A tropical cyclone genesis detection model is developed using remote sensing. </LI> <LI>  Dynamical and hydrologic factors are quantified from WindSat. </LI> <LI>  An objective model is constructed using decision trees algorithm. </LI> <LI>  The model shows the circulation symmetry and intensity are the most important. </LI> <LI>  Validation shows that the model produces high hit rate and low false alarm rate. </LI> </UL> </P>",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Box-office forecasting based on sentiments of movie reviews and Independent subspace method,2016,"['Box-office forecasting', 'Motion pictures', 'Sentiment analysis', 'Movie reviews', 'Independent subspace model']",,"<P>Box-office forecasting is a challenging but important task for movie distributors in their decision making process. Many previous studies have tried to determine a way to accurately predict the box-office, but the results reported have not been satisfactory for two main reasons: (1) lack of variable diversity and (2) simplicity of forecasting algorithms. Although the importance of word-of-mouth (WOM) has consistently emphasized in past studies, only summarized information, such as volume or valence of user ratings is commonly used. In forecasting algorithms, multiple linear regression is the most popular algorithm because it generates not only predicted values but also variable significances. In this study, new box-office forecasting models are presented to enhance the forecasting accuracy by utilizing review sentiments and employing non-linear machine learning algorithms. Viewer sentiments from review texts are used as input variables in addition to conventional predictors, whereas three machine learning-based algorithms, i.e., classification and regression tree (CART), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR), are employed to capture non-linear relationship between the box-office and its predictors. In order to provide variable importance for machine learning-based forecasting algorithms, an independent subspace method (ISM) is applied. Forecasting results from six different forecasting periods show that the presented methods can make accurate and robust forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Process-based approaches have the advantage of representing the atmosphere-vegetation-soil system and associated fluxes as an organic integration, but their sophistication results in a lack of high spatiotemporal resolution continuous products. Targeting this gap, we reported a new set of global 8-day composite 1-km resolution GPP and ET products from 2000 to 2015, using a simplified process-based model, the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). BESS couples atmosphere and canopy radiative transfer, photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and uses MODIS atmosphere and land data and other satellite data sources as inputs. We evaluated BESS products against FLUXNET observations at site scale (total of 113 sites, 742 site years), and against MPI-BGC products at global scale.

Research and development of AI is acceleratingly advanced. Along with the rapid development of AI, a new legal environment has been created that could not be considered in the past. For example, how to legally protect music and novels created by AI is a problem. However, the new legal problems arising from AI are not limited to the domain of such intellectual property law. Due to the increase in the possibility of automatic traveling vehicles due to the development of AI, various problems such as civil liability problems, criminal liability problems and the like at the time of accident occurrence, can only occur. Looking at AI in terms of law and institution, judgment and action of AI are considered to be the subject legal responsibility. For example, such an example is the liability for compensation when an accident occurs in autonomous driving of a self-running vehicle. Designers of artificial intelligence, manufacturers of products with AI and operators are involved, and it is necessary to organize where the legal responsibility lies. However, such a problem does not end with the issue of legislation theory.

It is proposed that in developing robot ethics for the autonomous vehicle an incremental, hybrid approach should be adopted, because driving cars is related to the safety of road traffic and the interests of other people. At first, it should be formed through top-down approach by combining of the two ethical theories: modified Asimov`s Three Laws of Robotics and harm-minimizing algorithm. The former, modified from the Asimov`s Three Laws of Robotics and adjusted to the autonomous vehicle, is partly suitable for the self-driving program due to its straightforwardness, hierarchical structure and emphasis on the rights of humans. And the latter, a program based on the utilitarianism, is also partly acceptable, because it makes the program in self-driving cars possible the calculation of the harms in case of the imminent accident. And then, upon this top-down approach, the information on the situation of roads, driving culture and other technological considerations should be supplemented by bottom-up approach, such as machine learning. In conclusion, the followings are suggested as the legal implications of the robot ethics of the autonomous vehicles: Firstly, the harm-minimizing algorithm should be scrutinized beforehand that it could be approved by the constitutional values, because in some cases it may be construed as the targeting and discriminating choices among human victims. Secondly, the laws, especially traffic laws should make up for the lacunas, that inevitably exist in robot ethics of the autonomous vehicles. Thirdly, the potential social preferences that may be caused through the priorities shown by the self-driving program should be controlled in view of the public interests. Finally, the principle-based regulations would be better than the specific and individual regulations as the laws that govern the autonomous vehicles, in order that they may always keep pace with the development of technologies.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

It refers to an area of computer science related to providing machines the ability to perform their own data analysis, decision making and forecasting. For example, one of the representative machine learning models is artificial neural network, which is a statistical learning algorithm inspired by the neural network structure of biology. In addition, there are other machine learning models such as decision tree model, naive bayes model and SVM(support vector machine) model. Among the machine learning models, we use SVM model in this study because it is mainly used for classification and regression analysis that fits well to our study. The core principle of SVM is to find a reasonable hyperplane that distinguishes different group in the data space. Given information about the data in any two groups, the SVM model judges to which group the new data belongs based on the hyperplane obtained from the given data set. Thus, the more the amount of meaningful data, the better the machine learning ability.  In recent years, many financial experts have focused on machine learning, seeing the possibility of combining with machine learning and the financial field where vast amounts of financial data exist. Machine learning techniques have been proved to be powerful in describing the non-stationary and chaotic stock price dynamics. A lot of researches have been successfully conducted on forecasting of stock prices using machine learning algorithms. Recently, financial companies have begun to provide Robo-Advisor service, a compound word of Robot and Advisor, which can perform various financial tasks through advanced algorithms using rapidly changing huge amount of data. Robo-Advisers main task is to advise the investors about the investors personal investment propensity and to provide the service to manage the portfolio automatically.  In this study, we propose a method of forecasting the Korean volatility index, VKOSPI, using the SVM model, which is one of the machine learning methods, and applying it to real option trading to increase the trading performance. VKOSPI is a measure of the future volatility of the KOSPI 200 index based on KOSPI 200 index option prices. VKOSPI is similar to the VIX index, which is based on S&P 500 option price in the United States. The Korea Exchange(KRX) calculates and announce the real-time VKOSPI index. VKOSPI is the same as the usual volatility and affects the option prices. The direction of VKOSPI and option prices show positive relation regardless of the option type (call and put options with various striking prices). If the volatility increases, all of the call and put option premium increases because the probability of the options exercise possibility increases. The investor can know the rising value of the option price with respect to the volatility rising value in real time through Vega, a Black-Scholess measurement index of an options sensitivity to changes in the volatility. Therefore, accurate forecasting of VKOSPI movements is one of the important factors that can generate profit in option trading.  In this study, we verified through real option data that the accurate forecast of VKOSPI is able to make a big profit in real option trading. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies on the idea of predicting the direction of VKOSPI based on machine learning and introducing the idea of applying it to actual option trading.  In this study predicted daily VKOSPI changes through SVM model and then made intraday option strangle position, which gives profit as option prices reduce, only when VKOSPI is expected to decline during daytime. We analyzed the results and tested whether it is applicable to real option trading based on SVMs prediction. The results showed the prediction accuracy of VKOSPI was 57.83% on average, and the number of position entry times was 43.2 times, which is less than half of the benchma",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Relation extraction based on two-step classification with distant supervision,2016,,,"<P>Supervised machine learning methods have been widely used in relation extraction to find the relation between two named entities in a sentence. However, the disadvantages of supervised machine learning methods are that constructing the training data set is costly and time-consuming, and the machine learning system is ultimately dependent on the specific domain of the training data. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a two-step relation extraction model with distant supervision. The two-step model consists of a one-class model and a multi-class model. The one-class model selects positive sentences from input sentences and the multi-class model classifies the positive sentences into specific classes. In the experiments, the proposed model showed good F1-measures (62.9 % in the auto-labeled test data, 63.8 % in the gold-labeled test data), although it does not use any human-labeled training data.</P>",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

DCCC-MAC: A Dynamic Common-Control-Channel-Based MAC Protocol for Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks,2016,"['support vector machine (SVM)', 'Cognitive radio network (CRN)', 'common control channel (CCC)', 'machine learning', 'medium access control (MAC)']",,"<P>We propose a novel dynamic common-control-channel-based medium access control (DCCC-MAC) protocol for cellular (centralized) cognitive radio (CR) networks. Specifically, unlike the traditional dedicated-control-channel-based medium access control (MAC) protocols, the proposed MAC protocol eliminates the requirement of a dedicated channel for control information exchange. During a given transmission frame, the common control channel (CCC) is selected by a cooperating set of secondary users (SUs) by using a support-vector-machine (SVM)-based learning technique. In the DCCC-MAC protocol, the frame duration is divided into four main phases as follows: spectrum sensing, CCC selection, data transmission, and beaconing. The SUs that participate in the CCC selection process are allocated channels for data transmission during a frame interval using a scheduling process, whereas the other SUs have to contend to access the channels. We present an analytical approach to calculate the minimum required number of minislots in the transmission frame for a given number of SUs in the CCC selection process. The saturation throughput of the proposed MAC protocol is analyzed in closed form. To this end, the numerical and simulation results are presented to quantify the performance of the proposed DCCC-MAC protocol. We also compare the performance of the DCCC-MAC protocol with that of two other state-of-the-art CR MAC protocols that use CCCs.</P>",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

In the present study, we employed a well established machine learning technique of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model in the trend analyses of groundwater level for the long-term change. The major benefit of GPR model is that the model provide not only the future predictions but also the associated uncertainty. In the study, the long-term predictions of groundwater level from the stations of National Groundwater Monitoring Network located within Han River Basin were exemplified as prediction cases based on the GPR model. In addition, a few types of groundwater change patterns were delineated (i.e., increasing, decreasing, and no trend) on the basis of the statistics acquired from GPR analyses. From the study, it was found that the majority of the monitoring stations has decreasing trend while small portion shows increasing or no trend. To further analyze the causes of the trend, the corresponding precipitation data were jointly analyzed by the same method (i.e., GPR).

Methods: 201,849 Health & Welfare related online documents from January 1 to March 31, 2016 from 171 Korean online channels and analyzed such documents using machine learning with random forest and Apriori algorithm association analysis. We used R software (version 3.2.1) for the association analysis data mining and visualization. Results: As for the prediction of future signals of health and welfare policies, policies that were important and supported by the people were welfare payment, health promotion, job, marriage/childbirth, health insurance, and healthcare industry (in this order). Specifically, as support for documents mentioning welfare payment and jobs was high, job creation through building a spontaneous welfare system is thought to be needed. Additionally, similar to the linkage analysis result of policies, as people were against documents that mentioned only {basic pension} policies, but supported documents that included {basic pension, welfare payment, job}, there is a strong demand for the establishment of a welfare system through active self-support and labor of the elderly. Conclusions: Social big data can be utilized in various areas. First, similar to the application in this study, future signals concerning government`s policies and new technologies can be predicted in advance and prepared for. Second, they can be used as a new data collection methods that supplement limitations in survey data collection systems.

Our method detects potential malicious domains from the seed domain information extracted from the TLD Zone files and WHOIS information. The inference process follows the three steps: searching the candidate domains, machine learning, and generating a suspicious domain pool. In the first step, we search the TLD Zone files and build a candidate domain set which has the same name server information with the seed domain. The next step clusters the candidate domains by the similarity of the WHOIS information. The final step in the inference process finds the seed domain’s cluster, and make the cluster as a suspicious domain set. In experiments, we used .COM and .NET TLD Zone files, and tested 10 seed domains selected by our analysts.

Real time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environments,2016,,,"<P>In recent years, the number of people using the Internet and network services is increasing day by day. On a daily basis, a large amount of data is generated over the Internet from zeta byte to petabytes with a very high speed. On the other hand, we see more security threats on the network, the Internet, websites, and the enterprise network. Therefore, detecting intrusion in such ultra-high-speed environment in real time is a challenging task. Many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are proposed for various types of network attacks using machine learning approaches. Most of them are unable to detect recent unknown attacks, whereas the others do not provide a real-time solution to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environment using Hadoop implementation. The proposed system includes four-layered IDS architecture, which consists of the capturing layer, filtration and load balancing layer, processing or Hadoop layer, and the decision-making layer. Furthermore, feature selection scheme is proposed that selects nine parameters for classification using (FSR) and (BER), as well as from the analysis of DARPA datasets. In addition, five major machine learning approaches are used to evaluate the proposed system including J48, REPTree, random forest tree, conjunctive rule, support vector machine, and Na < ve Bayes classifiers. Results show that among all these classifiers, REPTree and J48 are the best classifiers in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency. The proposed system architecture is evaluated with respect to accuracy in terms of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP), with respect to efficiency in terms of processing time and by comparing results with traditional techniques. It has more than 99 % TP and less than 0.001 % FP on REPTree and J48.

In the big data age, there are too many information sources to refer to when making decisions. For example, when considering travel to a city, a person may search reviews from a search engine such as Google or social networking services (SNSs) such as blogs, Twitter, and Facebook. The emotional polarity of positive and negative reviews helps a user decide on whether or not to make a trip. Sentiment analysis of customer reviews has become an important research topic as datamining technology is widely accepted for text mining of the Web. Sentiment analysis has been used to classify documents through machine learning techniques, such as the decision tree, neural networks, and support vector machines (SVMs). is used to determine the attitude, position, and sensibility of people who write articles about various topics that are published on the Web. Regardless of the polarity of customer reviews, emotional reviews are very helpful materials for analyzing the opinions of customers through their reviews. Sentiment analysis helps with understanding what customers really want instantly through the help of automated text mining techniques. Sensitivity analysis utilizes text mining techniques on text on the Web to extract subjective information in the text for text analysis. Sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the attitudes or positions of the person who wrote the article and presented their opinion about a particular topic.  In this study, we developed a model that selects a hot topic from user posts at Chinas online stock forum by using the k-means algorithm and self-organizing map (SOM). In addition, we developed a detecting model to predict a hot topic by using machine learning techniques such as logit, the decision tree, and SVM. We employed sensitivity analysis to develop our model for the selection and detection of hot topics from China’s online stock forum. The sensitivity analysis calculates a sentimental value from a document based on contrast and classification according to the polarity sentimental dictionary (positive or negative).  The online stock forum was an attractive site because of its information about stock investment. Users post numerous texts about stock movement by analyzing the market according to government policy announcements, market reports, reports from research institutes on the economy, and even rumors. We divided the online forum’s topics into 21 categories to utilize sentiment analysis. One hundred forty-four topics were selected among 21 categories at online forums about stock. The posts were crawled to build a positive and negative text database. We ultimately obtained 21,141 posts on 88 topics by preprocessing the text from March 2013 to February 2015. The interest index was defined to select the hot topics, and the k-means algorithm and SOM presented equivalent results with this data. We developed a decision tree model to detect hot topics with three algorithms: CHAID, CART, and C4.5. The results of CHAID were subpar compared to the others. We also employed SVM to detect the hot topics from negative data. The SVM models were trained with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel function by a grid search to detect the hot topics.  The detection of hot topics by using sentiment analysis provides the latest trends and hot topics in the stock forum for investors so that they no longer need to search the vast amounts of information on the Web.

Moreover, It is difficult defining what, exactly, “artificial intelligence” means. Rather than mentioning a particular point of view on the artificial intelligence technology, the primary aim of this paper is to promote awareness of nature of artificial intelligence to encourage lawyers, policy makers, and other relevant stakeholders to consider what may be appropriate legal and regulatory responses to artificial intelligence as they are being developed and deployed. Regulations are divided into two categories, ex ante and ex post regulation. The government should regulate the development and operation of artificial intelligence robot, autonomous vehicles by rulemaking, and permits current development and operation under certain conditions, should impose additional oversight on the development and operation of AI robot. But regulation by government would be difficult because A.I. research and development may be discreet, discrete, diffuse, and opaque. The ex ante regulation uses a judicially imposed liability system of corrective justice that requires wrongdoers to compensate victims for injury caused by a wrongdoing. But the autonomous nature of A.I. creates issues of foreseeability and control that might render ex post regulation ineffective.

The first stage of the method distinguishes between those pedestrian-blob situations that need to be merged and those that require splitting, followed by the use of trained decision trees to separate the pedestrians. The second stage generates the trajectories of each pedestrian by using the point-correspondence method; however, we introduce a new point-correspondence algorithm for which the A* search method has been modified. By using fuzzy membership functions, a heuristic evaluation of the correspondence between the blobs was also conducted.

Multi-view gait recognition using a doubly-kernel approach on the Grassmann manifold,2016,"['Gait recognition', 'Multi-view recognition', 'Kernel learning', 'Grassmann manifold', 'Subspace representation', 'Pattern recognition']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>View variation is one of the greatest challenges faced by the gait recognition research community. Recently, there are studies that model sets of gait features from multiple views as linear subspaces, which are known to form a special manifold called the Grassmann manifold. Conjecturing that modeling via linear subspace representation is not completely sufficient for gait recognition across view change, we take a step forward to consider non-linear subspace representation. A collection of multi-view gait features encapsulated in the form of a linear subspace is projected to the non-linear subspace through the expansion coefficients induced by kernel principal component analysis. Since subspace representation is inherently non-Euclidean, naïve vectorization as input to the vector-based pattern analysis machines is expected to yield suboptimal accuracy performance. We deal with this difficulty by embedding the manifold in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) through a positive definite kernel function defined on the Grassmann manifold. A closer examination reveals that the proposed approach can actually be interpreted as a doubly-kernel method. To be specific, the first kernel maps the linear subspace representation non-linearly to a feature space; while the second kernel permits the application of kernelization-enabled machines established for vector-based data on the manifold-valued multi-view gait features. Experiments on the CASIA gait database shows that the proposed doubly-kernel method is effective against view change in gait recognition.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  A Grassmann doubly-kernel approach is presented for multi-view gait recognition. </LI> <LI>  A collection of multi-view gait samples are represented as linear subspaces. </LI> <LI>  Non-linear variant of original subspaces are constructed via basis induced by KPCA. </LI> <LI>  Kernelized Grassmann kernels are introduced for application of vector-based method. </LI> <LI>  Experiments show promising results for gait recognition with vast view difference. </LI> </UL> </P>",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

The Effect of PCA On Kernel Classifiers For the Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease,2016,"['Alzheimer’s Disease', 'PCA', 'SVM', '알츠하이머병', '주성분분석', '서포트벡터머신']",,"This paper proposes the effect of principal component analysis (PCA) on many kernel classification techniques, such as (i) Single kernel Multi-Class support vector machine (SVM), (ii) Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and (iii) Generalized Multiple Kernel Learning (GMKL). PCA is a sophisticated way to reduce the dimensionality of high dimensional data, specially the high dimensional imaging data, while keeping most of the informative representative dimensions and excluding the least important ones. The aim of this Paper is to figure out whether PCA is actually a good idea in practice with kernel classifiers or not, in order to find a better framework for classification and analysis of brain imaging features in the study of Alzheimer’s disease. For this experiment the data used is FreeSurfer mean cortical thickness dataset downloaded from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu) baseline data. The classification accuracy (in classifying the three classes CN, LMCI, AD) of comparative methods has been evaluated using 3-fold cross validation. As a result of this comparative study, we could observe that applying PCA on different kernel classification methods has improved the classification accuracy.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Intelligence systems for diagnosis proved can be used to support diagnosis of the disease. Unfortunately, most of the data available between the level/type of coronary heart disease is unbalanced. As a result system performance is low. Methods: This paper proposes an intelligence systems for the diagnosis of the level of coronary heart disease taking into account the problem of data imbalance. The first stage of this research was preprocessing, which included resampled non-stratified random sampling (R), the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), clean data out of range attribute (COR), and remove duplicate (RD). The second step was the sharing of data for training and testing using a k-fold cross-validation model and training multiclass classification by the K-star algorithm. The third step was performance evaluation. The proposed system was evaluated using the performance parameters of sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value (PPV), negative prediction value (NPV), area under the curve (AUC) and F-measure. Results: The results showed that the proposed system provides an average performance with sensitivity of 80.1%, specificity of 95%, PPV of 80.1%, NPV of 95%, AUC of 87.5%, and Fmeasure of 80.1%.

No-reference Image Quality Assessment With A Gradient-induced Dictionary,2016,"['Image quality assessment', 'no-reference', 'dictionary', 'K-means clustering', 'SVM']",,"Image distortions are typically characterized by degradations of structures. Dictionaries learned from natural images can capture the underlying structures in images, which are important for image quality assessment (IQA). This paper presents a general-purpose no-reference image quality metric using a GRadient-Induced Dictionary (GRID). A dictionary is first constructed based on gradients of natural images using K-means clustering. Then image features are extracted using the dictionary based on Euclidean-norm coding and max-pooling. A distortion classification model and several distortion-specific quality regression models are trained using the support vector machine (SVM) by combining image features with distortion types and subjective scores, respectively. To evaluate the quality of a test image, the distortion classification model is used to determine the probabilities that the image belongs to different kinds of distortions, while the regression models are used to predict the corresponding distortion-specific quality scores. Finally, an overall quality score is computed as the probability-weighted distortion-specific quality scores. The proposed metric can evaluate image quality accurately and efficiently using a small dictionary. The performance of the proposed method is verified on public image quality databases. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric can generate quality scores highly consistent with human perception, and it outperforms the state-of-the-arts.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Joint components based pedestrian detection in crowded scenes using extended feature descriptors,2016,"['Joint components', 'Haar-like feature', 'Histograms of oriented gradient', 'Boosting machines', 'Support vector machine', 'Multiple scales of block based HOG features']",,"This paper presents a framework for human detection based on the joint component model using extended feature descriptors. This framework provides two contributions for handling the partially occluded problem of pedestrian detection in crowded environments. First, it presents feature descriptors based on extension of two well-known feature descriptors for accommodation in partially occluded pedestrian detection. The feature descriptors, which use multiple scale blocks-based histograms of oriented gradients (MHOG) and parallelogram based Haar-like feature (PHF), are proposed for improving the accuracy of the detection system. As a result of using MHOG, an extensive feature space allows for the obtaining of highly discriminated features, which supports robust detection. On the other hand, the PHF is adaptive for the shape of human limbs in detection of pedestrians. This contribution also presents special data structures to store image intensities and image gradients for using an integral image method, which is helpful for fast computation for both feature descriptors. Second, the joint component model for human detection is proposed for the training and detecting of pedestrians in crowded scenes. The proposed detection method based on fusion of the boosting technique and the support vector machine (SVM) is presented. The SVM is known as one of the most efficient learning models for classification. The advantage of boosting is a strong classifier based on a combination set of weak classifiers. However, the performance of boosting depends on the kernel of element classifier. The method based on the extended feature descriptors and the joint component model is helpful for constructing an efficient classification. The experimental results demonstrate that this method for pedestrian detection outperforms current methods in crowded situations under a variety of outdoor environments.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

These are human-robot interaction (HRI) researchers utilize digital image processing, pattern recognition and machine learning for their studies. Facial feature point detector algorithms are very important for face recognition, gaze tracking, expression, and emotion recognition. In this paper, a cascade facial feature point detector is used for finding facial feature points such as the eyes, nose and mouth. However, the detector has difficulty extracting the feature points from several images, because images have different conditions such as size, color, brightness, etc. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an algorithm using a modified cascade facial feature point detector using a convolutional neural network. The structure of the convolution neural network is based on LeNet-5 of Yann LeCun. For input data of the convolutional neural network, outputs from a cascade facial feature point detector that have color and gray images were used. The images were resized to 32×32 . In addition, the gray images were made into the YUV format. The gray and color images are the basis for the convolution neural network. Then, we classified about 1,200 testing images that show subjects.

Methods: In this study strategies and factors affecting the imputation accuracy of parent-offspring trios compared from lower-density SNP panels (5 K) to high density (10 K) SNP panel using three different Boosting methods namely TotalBoost (TB), LogitBoost (LB) and AdaBoost (AB). The methods employed using simulated data to impute the un-typed SNPs in parent-offspring trios. Four different datasets of G1 (100 trios with 5 k SNPs), G2 (100 trios with 10 k SNPs), G3 (500 trios with 5 k SNPs), and G4 (500 trio with 10 k SNPs) were simulated. In four datasets all parents were genotyped completely, and offspring genotyped with a lower density panel. Results: Comparison of the three methods for imputation showed that the LB outperformed AB and TB for imputation accuracy. The time of computation were different between methods. The AB was the fastest algorithm. The higher SNP densities resulted the increase of the accuracy of imputation. Larger trios (i.e. 500) was better for performance of LB and TB. Conclusions: The conclusion is that the three methods do well in terms of imputation accuracy also the dense chip is recommended for imputation of parent-offspring trios.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

In this paper, based on machine learning, a fast partitioning method is proposed, which can search for the best splitting structures for Intra-Prediction. In view of the video texture characteristics, we choose the entropy of Gray-Scale Difference Statistics (GDS) and the minimum of Sum of Absolute Transformed Difference (SATD) as two important features, which can make a balance between the computation complexity and classification performance. According to the selected features, adaptive decision trees can be built for the Coding Units (CU) with different size by offline training.

Text Steganography Based on Ci-poetry Generation Using Markov Chain Model,2016,"['Steganography', 'Ci-poetry Generation', 'Markov Chain', 'Mutual Information']",,"Steganography based on text generation has become a hot research topic in recent years. However, current text-generation methods which generate texts of normal style have either semantic or syntactic flaws. Note that texts of special genre, such as poem, have much simpler language model, less grammar rules, and lower demand for naturalness. Motivated by this observation, in this paper, we propose a text steganography that utilizes Markov chain model to generate Ci-poetry, a classic Chinese poem style. Since all Ci poems have fixed tone patterns, the generation process is to select proper words based on a chosen tone pattern. Markov chain model can obtain a state transfer matrix which simulates the language model of Ci-poetry by learning from a given corpus. To begin with an initial word, we can hide secret message when we use the state transfer matrix to choose a next word, and iterating until the end of the whole Ci poem. Extensive experiments are conducted and both machine and human evaluation results show that our method can generate Ci-poetry with higher naturalness than former researches and achieve competitive embedding rate.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Various research fields such as computer science and business management can take advantage of this feature to analyze customer-generated opinions.  In previous studies, the star rating of a review is regarded as the same as sentiment embedded in the text. However, it does not always correspond to the sentiment polarity. Due to this supposition, previous studies have some limitations in their accuracy. To solve this issue, the present study uses a supervised sentiment classification model to measure a more accurate sentiment polarity. This study aims to propose an advanced sentiment classifier and to discover the correlation between movie reviews and box-office success.  The advanced sentiment classifier is based on two supervised machine learning techniques, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN). The sentiment scores of the movie reviews are measured by the sentiment classifier and are analyzed by statistical correlations between movie reviews and box-office success. Movie reviews are collected along with a star-rate. The dataset used in this study consists of 1,258,538 reviews from 175 films gathered from Naver Movie website (movie.naver.com).  The results show that the proposed sentiment classifier outperforms Naive Bayes (NB) classifier as its accuracy is about 6% higher than NB. Furthermore, the results indicate that there are positive correlations between the star-rate and the number of audiences, which can be regarded as the box-office success of a movie. The study also shows that there is the mild, positive correlation between the sentiment scores estimated by the classifier and the number of audiences. To verify the applicability of the sentiment scores, an independent sample t-test was conducted. For this, the movies were divided into two groups using the average of sentiment scores.

Detecting Anatomical Landmarks for Fast Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis,2016,,,"<P>Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a very popular and effective technique used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). The success of computer-aided diagnosis methods using structural MRI data is largely dependent on the two time-consuming steps: 1) nonlinear registration across subjects, and 2) brain tissue segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a landmark-based feature extraction method that does not require nonlinear registration and tissue segmentation. In the training stage, in order to distinguish AD subjects from healthy controls (HCs), group comparisons, based on local morphological features, are first performed to identify brain regions that have significant group differences. In general, the centers of the identified regions become landmark locations (or AD landmarks for short) capable of differentiating AD subjects from HCs. In the testing stage, using the learned AD landmarks, the corresponding landmarks are detected in a testing image using an efficient technique based on a shape-constrained regression-forest algorithm. To improve detection accuracy, an additional set of salient and consistent landmarks are also identified to guide the AD landmark detection. Based on the identified AD landmarks, morphological features are extracted to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that is capable of predicting the AD condition. In the experiments, our method is evaluated on landmark detection and AD classification sequentially. Specifically, the landmark detection error (manually annotated versus automatically detected) of the proposed landmark detector is 2.41mm, and our landmark-based AD classification accuracy is 83.7%. Lastly, the AD classification performance of our method is comparable to, or even better than, that achieved by existing region-based and voxel-based methods, while the proposed method is approximately 50 times faster.</P>",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

To predict corporate credit ratings better, various algorithms of machine learning have been proposed and applied. However, the algorithms have some limitations. First of all, they are unable to give a solution for which variables in the dataset should be considered as input variables to effectively predict a dependent variable. Also, they are easily exposed to overfitting and risk being affected by outliers and noise. In addition, they are required to tune their numerous parameters. Under this background, this study proposes the application of Random Forests(RF) to overcome the weakness of the traditional techniques. RF were designed by Leo Breiman, an American statistician and professor, and are an ensemble learning technique. This algorithm has both features originating from bagging algorithm, which is to extend a single decision tree to various decision trees, and from random input selection. The benefit of our proposed algorithm is free from an overfitting issue, and both noise and outliers in the dataset cannot have an effect on it. Thus, our model can yield high accuracy in forecasting corporate credit ratings. To validate the effectiveness of RF in predicting corporate credit ratings, we applied it to a real world dataset of corporate credit rating in Korea. The data that we used for this research consisted of various financial ratios of 1,295 corporations and their corporate credit ratings. To evaluate and compare our model with traditional methods, we used the following methods: MDA(Multiple Discriminant Analysis), ANN(Artificial Neural Network) and MSVM(Multiclass SVM). Each model’s performance was calculated by predictive accuracy based on training and validation.　Empirical results showed that RF outperforms other traditional methods from the perspective of prediction accuracy.",machine_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
Visual Preference Assessment on Ultra-High-Definition Images,2016,,,"<P>With the recent evolution of ultra-high-definition (UHD) display technology, viewers can enjoy high-resolution content more realistically over TVs, virtual reality, portable, and wearable devices. To increase the visual attraction viewers perceive, post-processing of video content has been more powerfully conducted in such commercial devices. In this paper, we define a new terminology visual preference to quantify viewer perceptual preferences in a certain viewing environment with UHD images processed using sharpness and contrast enhancements. Viewers' visual preference for UHD images depends on the spatial resolution afforded by the UHD display, which in turn depends on the viewing geometry of the display resolution, display size, and viewing distance. In addition, viewers can perceive different degrees of quality and sharpness according to the content enhancement type and level, which leads to variation in the statistical dynamics of spatial image information. In this paper, we explore a novel methodology called the visual preference assessment model (VPAM) that accounts for content enhancement features, diverse viewing geometry, and statistical dynamics variation. The VPAM is a no-reference assessment method designed using an elaborate subjective preference assessment with support vector regression as the machine learning algorithm.

For these reasons, many researchers currently mainly focus on the brilliant machine learning-based prediction approaches for traffic prediction systems. This paper primarily addresses the analysis and comparison of prediction accuracy between two machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). Based on the fact that optimized estimation accuracy of these methods mainly depends on a large amount of recounted data and that they require much time to compute the same function heuristically for each action, we propose an approach that applies multi-threading to these heuristic methods. It is obvious that the greater the amount of historical data, the more processing time is necessary. For a real-time system, operational response time is vital, and the proposed system also focuses on the time complexity cost as well as computational complexity. It is experimentally confirmed that K-NN does much better than Naïve Bayes, not only in prediction accuracy but also in processing time. Multithreading- based K-NN could compute four times faster than classical K-NN, whereas multithreading - based Naïve Bayes could process only twice as fast as classical Bayes.",naive_bayes_2016_academic_riss.csv

It refers to an area of computer science related to providing machines the ability to perform their own data analysis, decision making and forecasting. For example, one of the representative machine learning models is artificial neural network, which is a statistical learning algorithm inspired by the neural network structure of biology. In addition, there are other machine learning models such as decision tree model, naive bayes model and SVM(support vector machine) model. Among the machine learning models, we use SVM model in this study because it is mainly used for classification and regression analysis that fits well to our study. The core principle of SVM is to find a reasonable hyperplane that distinguishes different group in the data space. Given information about the data in any two groups, the SVM model judges to which group the new data belongs based on the hyperplane obtained from the given data set. Thus, the more the amount of meaningful data, the better the machine learning ability.  In recent years, many financial experts have focused on machine learning, seeing the possibility of combining with machine learning and the financial field where vast amounts of financial data exist. Machine learning techniques have been proved to be powerful in describing the non-stationary and chaotic stock price dynamics. A lot of researches have been successfully conducted on forecasting of stock prices using machine learning algorithms. Recently, financial companies have begun to provide Robo-Advisor service, a compound word of Robot and Advisor, which can perform various financial tasks through advanced algorithms using rapidly changing huge amount of data. Robo-Advisers main task is to advise the investors about the investors personal investment propensity and to provide the service to manage the portfolio automatically.  In this study, we propose a method of forecasting the Korean volatility index, VKOSPI, using the SVM model, which is one of the machine learning methods, and applying it to real option trading to increase the trading performance. VKOSPI is a measure of the future volatility of the KOSPI 200 index based on KOSPI 200 index option prices. VKOSPI is similar to the VIX index, which is based on S&P 500 option price in the United States. The Korea Exchange(KRX) calculates and announce the real-time VKOSPI index. VKOSPI is the same as the usual volatility and affects the option prices. The direction of VKOSPI and option prices show positive relation regardless of the option type (call and put options with various striking prices). If the volatility increases, all of the call and put option premium increases because the probability of the options exercise possibility increases. The investor can know the rising value of the option price with respect to the volatility rising value in real time through Vega, a Black-Scholess measurement index of an options sensitivity to changes in the volatility. Therefore, accurate forecasting of VKOSPI movements is one of the important factors that can generate profit in option trading.  In this study, we verified through real option data that the accurate forecast of VKOSPI is able to make a big profit in real option trading. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies on the idea of predicting the direction of VKOSPI based on machine learning and introducing the idea of applying it to actual option trading.  In this study predicted daily VKOSPI changes through SVM model and then made intraday option strangle position, which gives profit as option prices reduce, only when VKOSPI is expected to decline during daytime. We analyzed the results and tested whether it is applicable to real option trading based on SVMs prediction. The results showed the prediction accuracy of VKOSPI was 57.83% on average, and the number of position entry times was 43.2 times, which is less than half of the benchma",naive_bayes_2016_academic_riss.csv

In previous studies, the star rating of a review is regarded as the same as sentiment embedded in the text. However, it does not always correspond to the sentiment polarity. Due to this supposition, previous studies have some limitations in their accuracy. To solve this issue, the present study uses a supervised sentiment classification model to measure a more accurate sentiment polarity. This study aims to propose an advanced sentiment classifier and to discover the correlation between movie reviews and box-office success.  The advanced sentiment classifier is based on two supervised machine learning techniques, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN). The sentiment scores of the movie reviews are measured by the sentiment classifier and are analyzed by statistical correlations between movie reviews and box-office success. Movie reviews are collected along with a star-rate. The dataset used in this study consists of 1,258,538 reviews from 175 films gathered from Naver Movie website (movie.naver.com).  The results show that the proposed sentiment classifier outperforms Naive Bayes (NB) classifier as its accuracy is about 6% higher than NB. Furthermore, the results indicate that there are positive correlations between the star-rate and the number of audiences, which can be regarded as the box-office success of a movie. The study also shows that there is the mild, positive correlation between the sentiment scores estimated by the classifier and the number of audiences. To verify the applicability of the sentiment scores, an independent sample t-test was conducted. For this, the movies were divided into two groups using the average of sentiment scores.

Previous research has been thoroughly reviewed for understanding fundamentals of k-NN algorithm that has been widely used for short-term traffic states prediction. The framework of this algorithm commonly includes historical data smoothing, pattern database, similarity measure, k-value, and prediction horizon. The outcomes of this study suggests that: i) historical data smoothing is recommended to reduce random noise of measured traffic data; ii) the historical database should contain traffic state information on both normal and event conditions; and iii) trial and error method can improve the prediction accuracy by better searching for the optimum input time series and k-value. The study results also demonstrates that predicted error increases with the duration of prediction horizon and rapidly changing traffic states.",k-NN_2016_academic_riss.csv

Intelligent Traffic Prediction by Multi-sensor Fusion using Multi-threaded Machine Learning,2016,"['Intelligent transportation system', 'K-nearest neighbor', 'Naive bayes']",,"Estimation and analysis of traffic jams plays a vital role in an intelligent transportation system and advances safety in the transportation system as well as mobility and optimization of environmental impact. For these reasons, many researchers currently mainly focus on the brilliant machine learning-based prediction approaches for traffic prediction systems. This paper primarily addresses the analysis and comparison of prediction accuracy between two machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). Based on the fact that optimized estimation accuracy of these methods mainly depends on a large amount of recounted data and that they require much time to compute the same function heuristically for each action, we propose an approach that applies multi-threading to these heuristic methods. It is obvious that the greater the amount of historical data, the more processing time is necessary. For a real-time system, operational response time is vital, and the proposed system also focuses on the time complexity cost as well as computational complexity. It is experimentally confirmed that K-NN does much better than Naïve Bayes, not only in prediction accuracy but also in processing time. Multithreading- based K-NN could compute four times faster than classical K-NN, whereas multithreading - based Naïve Bayes could process only twice as fast as classical Bayes.",k-NN_2016_academic_riss.csv

A comparison of the ratio of kinetic energy distributions of K- and K+ mesons to the HSD transport model calculations suggests that the inclusion of the in-medium modifications of kaon properties is necessary to reproduce the ratio.

The k-NN retrieval with Euclidean distance similarity measure and the Rocchio relevance feedback algorithm ( RRF) are used. To train the RRF parameters, the similarities of 1891 image pairs from 62 ( 31 malignant and 31 benign) masses are rated by 3 MQSA ( Mammography Quality Standards Act) radiologists using a 9-point scale ( 9= most similar). The best RRF parameters are chosen based on 3 observer experiments. For testing, 100 independent query masses ( 49 malignant and 51 benign) and 121 reference masses on 230 ( 79 malignant and 151 benign) images were collected. Three radiologists rated the similarity between the query masses and the computer-retrieved masses.

Operator decision support system for integrated wastewater management including wastewater treatment plants and receiving water bodies,2016,,,"<P>An operator decision support system (ODSS) is proposed to support operators of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in making appropriate decisions. This system accounts for water quality (WQ) variations in WWTP influent and effluent and in the receiving water body (RWB). The proposed system is comprised of two diagnosis modules, three prediction modules, and a scenario-based supporting module (SSM). In the diagnosis modules, the WQs of the influent and effluent WWTP and of the RWB are assessed via multivariate analysis. Three prediction modules based on the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, activated sludge model no. 2d (ASM2d) model, and QUAL2E model are used to forecast WQs for 3 days in advance. To compare various operating alternatives, SSM is applied to test various predetermined operating conditions in terms of overall oxygen transfer coefficient (Kla), waste sludge flow rate (Qw), return sludge flow rate (Qr), and internal recycle flow rate (Qir). In the case of unacceptable total phosphorus (TP), SSM provides appropriate information for the chemical treatment. The constructed ODSS was tested using data collected from Geumho River, which was the RWB, and S WWTP in Daegu City, South Korea. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed ODSS to provide WWTP operators with more objective qualitative and quantitative assessments of WWTP and RWB WQs. Moreover, the current study shows that ODSS, using data collected from the study area, can be used to identify operational alternatives through SSM at an integrated urban wastewater management level.</P>",k-NN_2016_academic_riss.csv

To achieve the goal, the phrasal words were extracted from the transcribed label scripts of the Seoul Corpus using Praat. Following this, the onsets, peaks, codas and syllable types of the phrasal words were analyzed using an R script. Results revealed that k0 was most frequently used as an onset in both orthographic and pronounced phrasal words. Also, aa was the most favored vowel in the Korean syllable peak with fewer phonological processes in its pronounced form. The total proportion of all diphthongs according to the frequency of the peaks in the orthographic phrasal words was 8.8%, which was almost double those found in the pronounced phrasal words. For the codas, nn accounted for 34.4% of the total pronounced phrasal words and was the varied form. From syllable type classification of the Corpus, CV appeared to be the most frequent type followed by CVC, V, and VC from the orthographic forms. Overall, the onsets were more prevalent in the pronunciation more than the codas.

Structural and dielectric characterization results revealed that a low level of NN addition (x = 0.04) to BT is sufficient to cause a continuous relaxor-to-ferroelectric transition, and the relaxor behavior was consistently observed at compositions with high NN content up to x = 0.7. A number of relaxor parameters including the Curie temperature, Burns temperature, freezing temperature, gamma, diffuseness parameter (delta), and activation energy were determined from the temperature and frequency dependency of the real part of the dielectric permittivity for various BT-NN compositions using the Curie-Weiss law and Vogel-Fulcher relationship.

Beam-energy dependence of charge balance functions from Au + Au collisions at energies available at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider,2016,,,"<P>Balance functions have been measured in terms of relative pseudorapidity (Delta(eta)) for charged particle pairs at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider from Au + Au collisions at root s(NN) = 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV using the STAR detector. These results are compared with balance functions measured at the CERN Large Hadron Collider from Pb + Pb collisions at root s(NN) = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE Collaboration. The width of the balance function decreases as the collisions become more central and as the beam energy is increased. In contrast, the widths of the balance functions calculated using shuffled events show little dependence on centrality or beam energy and are larger than the observed widths. Balance function widths calculated using events generated by UrQMD are wider than the measured widths in central collisions and show little centrality dependence. The measured widths of the balance functions in central collisions are consistent with the delayed hadronization of a deconfined quark gluon plasma (QGP). The narrowing of the balance function in central collisions at root s(NN) = 7.7 GeV implies that a QGP is still being created at this relatively low energy.</P>",k-NN_2016_academic_riss.csv

On-chip micromanipulation using a magnetically driven micromanipulator with an acoustically oscillating bubble,2016,"['Microsurgery', 'Bubble dynamics', 'Cavitational microstreaming', 'Cell manipulation']",,"This paper presents a magnetically driven micromanipulator for biological and microscale (bio/micro-) object manipulation in a microfluidic chip. The proposed micromanipulator mainly consists of a gaseous bubble that functions as a gripping tool and twin permanent magnets allowing for two-dimensional (2D) motion control in an aqueous medium. First, the 2D motion control of the micromanipulator (horizontal, vertical, and rotational motions) was demonstrated by using an external magnetic controller attached to the bottom of the chip, capable of altering the interaction forces induced by twin magnets installed inside both the micromanipulator and controller. Second, the micro-object manipulation was separately tested with glass beads (100μm diameter) and steel balls (600μm diameter) using an acoustically oscillating bubble. When the bubble was acoustically excited around its natural frequency by a piezoactuator, the radiation force generated from it attracted neighboring objects. The capturing force generated from an acoustically excited bubble was indirectly measured using the glass beads in a mini-channel. The maximum capturing force occurring at the natural frequency of the bubble was approximately 390nN. Finally, the manipulation of the steel balls on a chip was achieved with the use of both the magnetic and acoustic actuation.

Additionally, the direct ratio of the invariant yields from U + U and Au + Au collisions within the same centrality class is presented, and used to investigate the role of c (c) over bar coalescence. Two different parametrizations of the deformed Woods-Saxon distribution were used in Glauber calculations to determine the values of the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions in each centrality class, N-coll, and these were found to give significantly different Ncoll values. Results using N-coll values from both deformed Woods-Saxon distributions are presented. The measured ratios show that the J/psi suppression, relative to binary collision scaling, is similar in U + U and Au + Au for peripheral and midcentral collisions, but that J/psi show less suppression for the most central U + U collisions. The results are consistent with a picture in which, for central collisions, increase in the J/psi yield due to c (c) over bar coalescence becomes more important than the decrease in yield due to increased energy density. For midcentral collisions, the conclusions about the balance between c (c) over bar coalescence and suppression depend on which deformed Woods-Saxon distribution is used to determine N-coll.</P>",k-NN_2016_academic_riss.csv
Azimuthally anisotropic emission of low-momentum direct photons in Au + Au collisions at <sub>sNN</sub>=200 GeV,2016,,,"<P>The PHENIX experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured second- and third-order Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal distributions of direct photons emitted at midrapidity in Au + Au collisions at root S-NN = 200 GeV for various collision centralities. Combining two different analysis techniques, results were obtained in the transverse momentum range of 0.4 < p(T) < 4.0 GeV/c. At low p(T) the second-order coefficients, nu(2), are similar to the ones observed in hadrons. Third-order coefficients, nu(3), are nonzero and almost independent of centrality. These new results on nu(2) and nu(3), combined with previously published results on yields, are compared to model calculations that provide yields and asymmetries in the same framework. Those models are challenged to explain simultaneously the observed large yield and large azimuthal anisotropies.</P>",k-NN_2016_academic_riss.csv

The subjects in this study were 212 selected underachievers who were in their first grade in middle school. An experiment was implemented in 18 sessions for six weeks. 72 students participated in a learning motivation program, and a learning strategy program was provided for 70 students. The other 70 students studied on their own. The groups that participated in the learning motivation program and the learning strategy program made better progress than the unsupervised learning group. Therefore the two programs were found to be effective intervention methods for underachievement, and the effects of the programs varied with the variables. The learning strategy program had significant effects on intrinsic motivation, which was a subfactor of learning motivation, and on self-efficacy and science academic achievement. The learning motivation program had significant effects on task value, which was a subfactor of learning motivation, and on academic learning time and social studies academie achievement. There were no significant differences between the effects of the two programs in academic procrastination and language arts academic achievement.

There are various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks. Those have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Among those architectures, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are classified as the supervised learning model. And in recent years, those supervised learning models have gained more popularity than unsupervised learning models such as deep belief networks, because supervised learning models have shown fashionable applications in such fields mentioned above.  Deep learning models can be trained with backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation is an abbreviation for “backward propagation of errors” and a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient of an error function with respect to all the weights in the network. The gradient is fed to the optimization method which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the error function.  Convolutional neural networks use a special architecture which is particularly well-adapted to classify images. Using this architecture makes convolutional networks fast to train. This, in turn, helps us train deep, muti-layer networks, which are very good at classifying images. These days, deep convolutional networks are used in most neural networks for image recognition. Convolutional neural networks use three basic ideas: local receptive fields, shared weights, and pooling. By local receptive fields, we mean that each neuron in the first(or any) hidden layer will be connected to a small region of the input(or previous layer’s) neurons. Shared weights mean that we’re going to use the same weights and bias for each of the local receptive field. This means that all the neurons in the hidden layer detect exactly the same feature, just at different locations in the input image. In addition to the convolutional layers just described, convolutional neural networks also contain pooling layers. Pooling layers are usually used immediately after convolutional layers. What the pooling layers do is to simplify the information in the output from the convolutional layer. Recent convolutional network architectures have 10 to 20 hidden layers and billions of connections between units. Training deep learning networks has taken weeks several years ago, but thanks to progress in GPU and algorithm enhancement, training time has reduced to several hours.  Neural networks with time-varying behavior are known as recurrent neural networks or RNNs. A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Early RNN models turned out to be very difficult to train, harder even than deep feedforward networks. The reason is the unstable gradient problem such as vanishing gradient and exploding gradient. The gradient can get smaller and smaller as it is propagated back through layers. This makes learning in early layers extremely slow. The problem actually gets worse in RNNs, since gradients aren’t just propagated backward through layers, they’re propagated backward through time. If the network runs for a long time, that can make the gradient extremely unstable and hard to learn from. It has been possible to incorporate an idea known as long short-term memory units (LSTMs) into RNNs. LSTMs make it much easier to get good results when traini",unsupervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
시스템 결함 분석을 위한 이벤트 로그 연관성에 관한 연구,2016,"['Correlation Analysis', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'System Fault Detection']",,"To identify the cause of the error and maintain the health of system, an administrator usually analyzes event log data since it contains useful information to infer the cause of the error. However, because today's systems are huge and complex, it is almost impossible for administrators to manually analyze event log files to identify the cause of an error. In particular, as OpenStack, which is being widely used as cloud management system, operates with various service modules being linked to multiple servers, it is hard to access each node and analyze event log messages for each service module in the case of an error. For this, in this paper, we propose a novel message-based log analysis method that enables the administrator to find the cause of an error quickly. Specifically, the proposed method 1) consolidates event log data generated from system level and application service level, 2) clusters the consolidated data based on messages, and 3) analyzes interrelations among message groups in order to promptly identify the cause of a system error. This study has great significance in the following three aspects. First, the root cause of the error can be identified by collecting event logs of both system level and application service level and analyzing interrelations among the logs. Second, administrators do not need to classify messages for training since unsupervised learning of event log messages is applied. Third, using Dynamic Time Warping, an algorithm for measuring similarity of dynamic patterns over time increases accuracy of analysis on patterns generated from distributed system in which time synchronization is not exactly consistent.",unsupervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Deformable MR Prostate Segmentation via Deep Feature Learning and Sparse Patch Matching,2016,,,"<P>Automatic and reliable segmentation of the prostate is an important but difficult task for various clinical applications such as prostate cancer radiotherapy. The main challenges for accurate MR prostate localization lie in two aspects: (1) inhomogeneous and inconsistent appearance around prostate boundary, and (2) the large shape variation across different patients. To tackle these two problems, we propose a new deformable MR prostate segmentation method by unifying deep feature learning with the sparse patch matching. First, instead of directly using handcrafted features, we propose to learn the latent feature representation from prostate MR images by the stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE). Since the deep learning algorithm learns the feature hierarchy from the data, the learned features are often more concise and effective than the handcrafted features in describing the underlying data. To improve the discriminability of learned features, we further refine the feature representation in a supervised fashion. Second, based on the learned features, a sparse patch matching method is proposed to infer a prostate likelihood map by transferring the prostate labels from multiple atlases to the new prostate MR image. Finally, a deformable segmentation is used to integrate a sparse shape model with the prostate likelihood map for achieving the final segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the dataset that contains 66 T2-wighted prostate MR images. Experimental results show that the deep-learned features are more effective than the handcrafted features in guiding MR prostate segmentation. Moreover, our method shows superior performance than other state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Index Terms-Deformable</P>",supervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
What is the Safe Training to Educate the Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy for Surgical Residents in Early Learning Curve?,2016,"['laparoscopic cholecystectomy', 'biliary', 'training', 'surgical resident', 'complication']",,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) performed by surgical residents.Methods: We reviewed the records of patients who underwent LC for chronic cholecystitis and gallbladder polyps between February 2010 and July 2012. All diagnoses were confirmed by biopsy. All procedures performed by surgical residents were carried out under the close supervision of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. A standard four-port method was used, and we achieved the “critical view of safety” in almost all patients.Results: Of 219 LC procedures, 136 were performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon, and 83 by surgical residents. There was no significant difference in postoperative hospital stay (1.1 vs 1.2 days, p=0.337) or complication rates (3.7% vs 2.4%, p=0.712) between the two groups. However the patients operated on by surgical residents had significantly longer operation time (40.7 vs 63.7 min, p<0.05).Conclusions: LC performed by inexperienced surgical residents under the supervision of an experienced surgeon is safe and feasible for chronic cholecystitis and gallbladder polyps. Major bile duct injury is strongly correlated with having performed fewer than 20 LC procedures, so surgical residents must secure the “critical view of safety”, and the supervising surgeon must confirm it before the cystic duct and cystic artery are ligated.",supervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

An automated, robust, and fast method is required to overcome such burdensome processes. These needs are, however, challenging due to various cell shapes, intensity, and incomplete boundaries. A precise cell segmentation will allow to making a pathological diagnosis of tissue samples. A vast body of literature exists on cell segmentation in microscopy images [1]. The majority of existing work is based on input images and predefined feature models only – for example, using a deformable model to extract edge boundaries in the image. Only a handful of recent methods employ data-driven approaches, such as supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven cell segmentation algorithm for bright-field microscopy images. The proposed method minimizes an energy formula defined by two dictionaries – one is for input images and the other is for their manual segmentation results – and a common sparse code, which aims to find the pixel-level classification by deploying the learned dictionaries on new images. In contrast to deformable models, we do not need to know a prior knowledge of objects. We also employed convolutional sparse coding and Alternating Direction of Multiplier Method (ADMM) for fast dictionary learning and energy minimization. Unlike an existing method [1], our method trains both dictionaries concurrently, and is implemented using the GPU device for faster performance.",supervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

To keep up with the systematic progress of the headquarters, there had been various attempts to establish the local diocese in Chung-nam. Cheondoism rapidly gained broad acceptance and expanded the congregation.  Starting with the Seosan and Hongju dioceses in 1906, a total of 25 dioceses had been established in 14 counties, organizing the archdiocese in Seosan and Dangjin respectively.  This rapid expansion was all due to diverse mission activities.  Cheondo-kyo successfully utilized the youth organizations for missionary work. They supervised bishops and local dioceses by themselves.  Consequently, the number of local dioceses in Chung-nam had reached 11, with 16,219 followers.  More dioceses were organized and more temples were built nationwide. These led to rapid growth in congregation in the area.  Cheondo-kyo, originated from Donghak(""Eastern Learning"") in 1905 had evolved and came to be widespread in the country. And its outcome was labed the Cheondoist March First Movement.  The March First Movement, which first started in Seoul, was spread by distributing the Declaration of Independence.   It was Nonsan where the Declaration of Independence was handed out in Chungnam area.  The Nonsan diocese received the Declaration of Independence through the Hamyeol diocese of Iksan, Jeonbuk which is geographically adjacent to Nonsan. Kim Taeho and Lee Baeksoon, Cheondoists in Nonsan, received and distributed the Declaration in the area of Buyeo and Nonsan. And , as a result, the March First Movement in the Chungnam area could develop.  Cheondo-kyo followers took part in the March First Movement, and often very actively. It was their way of expressing their greatest wish for the Independence.  Cheondo-kyo believers in the Gongju area were severely persecuted, implication being they actively participated in the 3.1 Movement. It is extremely significant that the Cheondo-kyo followers took the lead from the beginning to the end of the Movement.  It is also considered very meaningful that Cheondoists in Buyeo joined the 3.1 Movement inspired by the Declaration of Independence from Nonsan whereas Christians and Cheondoists joined forces in Seosan. Kweon Byung-deok led the Movement in A-san.

Such acts will loss the investor’s trust in the market and hindering the development of the capital market. The significance of the civil compensation system of insider trading lies in when the insiders of listed companies use the undisclosed information to buy and sell the financial investment products and caused investors to loss. It is necessary to bear the corresponding civil liability compensation for the loss of the investors and thereby inhibiting such behaviors. This article will be comparing and analyzing the insider trading differences of the legal provisions and judicial practice of the civil compensation system between China and Korea and trying to improve the views of China’s legislative work. Before describing the civil compensation system for insider trading in China and Korea, article Ⅱ will focus on introducing the insider trading evolution of United States as an example, and then discussing its concepts and related theories in order to understand the legal regulation for insider trading better. This article Ⅲ will take the case as the center to introduce insider trading legislation of China and Korea in the elements of responsibility, form and other content and focusing on analysis the “Recovery of Short Swing Profits”. Firstly, introduces the legislative evolution of insider trading in China and Korea. Then then describes the specific content of the two countries legislation. And give the cases to introduce the specific performance of the laws of the two countries. Finally, introduce the United States of the relevant legal provisions of the United States as reference. This article Ⅳ will compares the civil compensation system of insider trading between China and Korea and reference the US experience to improve the Chinese legislative system. In the legislative technology, such as the expression of the Korean Capital Market Act Article 174, paragraph 1 “the outsider exercised his power or perform their duties Know the insider information”, only one clause to cover the need to express the content that worth to learning. On the insider scope of the set how to define the “illegal access to insider information” of Chinese law and it is recognized as insider trading is questionable. On Korean law the “the people of obtain undisclosed important information” and “job-related” joint statement can fully solved how to identify the main problem. On the causal relationship, the securities law of China does not make fundamental provisions on the causal relationship. But the expression as the “other losses associated with the transaction” of Korean law gives the judge a certain discretion. And in the trail practice of Korea, Korea has accumulated a large number of cases, and it played the role of inhibition of insider trading. With regard to avoidance losses, for the “illegal income” of Chinese law should be expanded to explain and including “avoidance losses”. But considering the complexity of judicial practice of china, it seems appropriate to include “avoidance losses” in the articles. On the “Recovery of Short Swing Profits”, legislation of China on the provisions of the object has serious legislative shortcomings. While the short swing exception to consider is not enough. The above-mentioned problems it is necessary to solve. The capital market of China cannot be regarded as a sound investment market. In the regulatory authorities to strengthen supervision, at the same time the insider trading is happening more and more frequently. Although the regulatory and policy of government can influence the development of the securities market, the legislature to develop appropriate legal and regulatory policies, and regulators and the judiciary to strictly enforce the regulation of the market is to save the market.",supervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

There are various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks. Those have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Among those architectures, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are classified as the supervised learning model. And in recent years, those supervised learning models have gained more popularity than unsupervised learning models such as deep belief networks, because supervised learning models have shown fashionable applications in such fields mentioned above.  Deep learning models can be trained with backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation is an abbreviation for “backward propagation of errors” and a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient of an error function with respect to all the weights in the network. The gradient is fed to the optimization method which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the error function.  Convolutional neural networks use a special architecture which is particularly well-adapted to classify images. Using this architecture makes convolutional networks fast to train. This, in turn, helps us train deep, muti-layer networks, which are very good at classifying images. These days, deep convolutional networks are used in most neural networks for image recognition. Convolutional neural networks use three basic ideas: local receptive fields, shared weights, and pooling. By local receptive fields, we mean that each neuron in the first(or any) hidden layer will be connected to a small region of the input(or previous layer’s) neurons. Shared weights mean that we’re going to use the same weights and bias for each of the local receptive field. This means that all the neurons in the hidden layer detect exactly the same feature, just at different locations in the input image. In addition to the convolutional layers just described, convolutional neural networks also contain pooling layers. Pooling layers are usually used immediately after convolutional layers. What the pooling layers do is to simplify the information in the output from the convolutional layer. Recent convolutional network architectures have 10 to 20 hidden layers and billions of connections between units. Training deep learning networks has taken weeks several years ago, but thanks to progress in GPU and algorithm enhancement, training time has reduced to several hours.  Neural networks with time-varying behavior are known as recurrent neural networks or RNNs. A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Early RNN models turned out to be very difficult to train, harder even than deep feedforward networks. The reason is the unstable gradient problem such as vanishing gradient and exploding gradient. The gradient can get smaller and smaller as it is propagated back through layers. This makes learning in early layers extremely slow. The problem actually gets worse in RNNs, since gradients aren’t just propagated backward through layers, they’re propagated backward through time. If the network runs for a long time, that can make the gradient extremely unstable and hard to learn from. It has been possible to incorporate an idea known as long short-term memory units (LSTMs) into RNNs. LSTMs make it much easier to get good results when traini",supervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
텍스트 분석을 통한 이종 매체 카테고리 다중 매핑 방법론,2016,"['Category Mapping', 'Document Classification', 'Text Mining', 'Topic Modeling']",,"In recent years, the proliferation of diverse social networking services has led users to use many mediums simultaneously depending on their individual purpose and taste. Besides, while collecting information about particular themes, they usually employ various mediums such as social networking services, Internet news, and blogs. However, in terms of management, each document circulated through diverse mediums is placed in different categories on the basis of each source’s policy and standards, hindering any attempt to conduct research on a specific category across different kinds of sources. For example, documents containing content on “Application for a foreign travel” can be classified into “Information Technology,” “Travel,” or “Life and Culture” according to the peculiar standard of each source. Likewise, with different viewpoints of definition and levels of specification for each source, similar categories can be named and structured differently in accordance with each source.  To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a plan for conducting category mapping between different sources with various mediums while maintaining the existing category system of the medium as it is. Specifically, by re-classifying individual documents from the viewpoint of diverse sources and storing the result of such a classification as extra attributes, this study proposes a logical layer by which users can search for a specific document from multiple heterogeneous sources with different category names as if they belong to the same source. Besides, by collecting 6,000 articles of news from two Internet news portals, experiments were conducted to compare accuracy among sources, supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, and homogeneous and heterogeneous learning data. It is particularly interesting that in some categories, classifying accuracy of semi-supervised learning using heterogeneous learning data proved to be higher than that of supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, which used homogeneous learning data.  This study has the following significances. First, it proposes a logical plan for establishing a system to integrate and manage all the heterogeneous mediums in different classifying systems while maintaining the existing physical classifying system as it is. This study’s results particularly exhibit very different classifying accuracies in accordance with the heterogeneity of learning data; this is expected to spur further studies for enhancing the performance of the proposed methodology through the analysis of characteristics by category. In addition, with an increasing demand for search, collection, and analysis of documents from diverse mediums, the scope of the Internet search is not restricted to one medium. However, since each medium has a different categorical structure and name, it is actually very difficult to search for a specific category insofar as encompassing heterogeneous mediums. The proposed methodology is also significant for presenting a plan that enquires into all the documents regarding the standards of the relevant sites’ categorical classification when the users select the desired site, while maintaining the existing site’s characteristics and structure as it is.  This study’s proposed methodology needs to be further complemented in the following aspects. First, though only an indirect comparison and evaluation was made on the performance of this proposed methodology, future studies would need to conduct more direct tests on its accuracy. That is, after re-classifying documents of the object source on the basis of the categorical system of the existing source, the extent to which the classification was accurate needs to be verified through evaluation by actual users. In addition, the accuracy in classification needs to be increased by making the methodology more sophisticated. Furthermore, an understanding is required that the characteristics of some categories that showed a",supervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Then this paper will state Toegye`s reasoning why he introduced Seven-Feelings for studying in The Chapter of Rectifying the Mind of The book Great Learning, Gobong`s contention of Not Perfectly-measured of Four-Beginnings as a refutation from Toegye`s logic, and will figure the divergence of two opinions. Toegye emphasizes only Seven-Feelings as a study subject because Purely-Good nature of Four-Beginnings cannot harm inside mind yet there is a possibility of Seven-Feelings might turn into Evil. On the other hand, Gobong focuses both Four-Beginnings and Seven-Feelings for study subjects with his view which Four-Beginnings could involve inside mind with intention and eventually can cause the result of Not Perfectly-measured of Four-Beginnings. In Toegye`s opinion, Not Perfectly-measured of Four-Beginnings is just the result of wrong manifestation interrupted by intention. Toegye insists that Four-Beginnings itself cannot be described as Perfectly-measured or Not Perfectly-measured. For him, the matter of Perfectly-measured or Not Perfectly-measured of Four-Beginnings is not defined as Origins but is on the level of the expansion of the Supervision of Mind.

Various research fields such as computer science and business management can take advantage of this feature to analyze customer-generated opinions.  In previous studies, the star rating of a review is regarded as the same as sentiment embedded in the text. However, it does not always correspond to the sentiment polarity. Due to this supposition, previous studies have some limitations in their accuracy. To solve this issue, the present study uses a supervised sentiment classification model to measure a more accurate sentiment polarity. This study aims to propose an advanced sentiment classifier and to discover the correlation between movie reviews and box-office success.  The advanced sentiment classifier is based on two supervised machine learning techniques, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN). The sentiment scores of the movie reviews are measured by the sentiment classifier and are analyzed by statistical correlations between movie reviews and box-office success. Movie reviews are collected along with a star-rate. The dataset used in this study consists of 1,258,538 reviews from 175 films gathered from Naver Movie website (movie.naver.com).  The results show that the proposed sentiment classifier outperforms Naive Bayes (NB) classifier as its accuracy is about 6% higher than NB. Furthermore, the results indicate that there are positive correlations between the star-rate and the number of audiences, which can be regarded as the box-office success of a movie. The study also shows that there is the mild, positive correlation between the sentiment scores estimated by the classifier and the number of audiences. To verify the applicability of the sentiment scores, an independent sample t-test was conducted. For this, the movies were divided into two groups using the average of sentiment scores.

His activities had goals: the first was to regain the territory and the sovereignty stolen by the Japanese empire and build a autonomic independent nation, and the second was to foil the national division and found a unified nation. He also had another goal to found a civilized nation and serve for the world peace.Baikbum, developing the independent movement centering around the provisional government of Republic of Korea, tried to build an autonomic independent nation. The autonomic independent nation that he tried to build meant a nation governed by our own people without any foreign interference. When he learned that the US and the UK in 1943 agreed to resolve the matter of Korea within international joint supervision, and when he learned that the Moscow Conference of 3 Foreign Ministers in 1945 decided the trusteeship over Korea, he held opposition movement. It was because the international joint supervision and the trusteeship meant another interference of foreign powers succeeding the Japanese empire.As Baikbum experienced the territorial and national division, he tried to establish a unified nation. As the Soviet army and the US army separately occupied the Korean peninsula by the 38th parallel, and as Syngman Rhee propelled the South to establishing separate government, Korea faced the crisis of the territorial and national division. Baikbum in this situation tried to found a unified nation. He thought that if the South established a separate government, the North would do so as well; and then the nation would be divided. He believed that the result of the division would be a nationally disastrous war regardless of our nation’s own will, as the two would become the informants of the Soviet and the US.Baikbum proposed the way for founding a unified nation: the pullout of armies of the Soviet and the US → the South and North key-figure meeting → the South and North unified general election → the establishment of a unified government. Baikbum, with Kim Gyushik, propelled it, and proposed it to the UN committee. And then, he sent Kim Ilsung and Kim Dubong letters suggesting the South and North key-figure meeting to discuss the matter. April of 1948, he went to Pyeongyang, held the South-North negotiation, and achieved an agreement for the way and the steps to establish a unified democratic government: the pullout of armies of the Soviet and the US → the convocation of All-Joseon Political Meeting → building a provisional government → founding a unified legislature → founding a unified democratic government. However, as the South and the North separately established governments, it could not be realized.Baikbum had a dream for building a civilized nation and for world peace. Baikbum’s dream was “all people in the world living together without you-me discrimination”: building a country all people in the world can live peacefully. The way was to build a autonomic independent nation without any foreign interference, to build a nation confirming people’s liberty in order to create high-level culture, and for each people to build a civilized nation with its best culture. It was Baikbum’s dream that each people would build a civilized nation and help each other, and that all people on the earth could experience peace and happiness within the world peace.",supervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

One of the most prominent painters who made a constant effort to defend and revitalise Chinese painting amid Western domination in the early and mid-twentieth century, he was deeply concerned with the issue of how to explore a new creative territory within the Chinese ink and brush tradition. Fu Baoshi was born in the last years of the Qing dynasty(1644-1912) when China was going through unprecedented turmoil and transformation. Despite his humble background, his diverse experiences from an early age, including his frequent visits to the mounting and seal carving shops, his education at the newly established modern school, his teaching experiences, his identity as an artist and his overseas study with the help of Xu Beihong(1895-1953), all combined to play a significant role in his individual artistic pursuit as well as his responsibility as an artist representing his country.  This paper focuses on Fu Baoshi’s studies in Japan from 1932 to 1935 and explores the role this experience played as a catalyst for him to rethink the nature of Chinese art and its tradition, providing him with an opportunity to enlarge his artistic horizons. On 5th September 1932, Fu Baoshi went to Japan under a Chinese government scholarship to carry out research into Japanese arts and crafts with the aim of helping to improve the Jingdezhen ceramic industry. During his first year in Tokyo, his observation of Japan’s promotion of arts and crafts and protection of the country’s artistic heritage motivated him to urge the Chinese government to learn from Japan. By visiting art schools, galleries and museums, Fu Baoshi learnt about the Japanese government’s systemic institutionalisation of art and its promotion of art exhibitions and art associations, in particular the significance of national treasures and the importance of preserving them, at the same time increasing his sense of national mission as an artist.  During his second year as a post-graduate student at the Imperial School of Fine Arts in Tokyo(Teikoku bijutsu gakkō, 帝国美術学校; today Musashino Art University), Fu Baoshi concentrated on training in the history of art under the supervision of his Japanese professor Kinbara Seigo(金原省吾, 1888-1958). As such, this paper also investigates how Fu Baoshi engaged with art historical research on Chinese art through the lens of Japanese scholarship and rediscovered and reinterpreted the Chinese art tradition by analysing his own writings and other related Japanese articles. He developed his knowledge on Chinese painting through the Japanese scholarship, particularly on the Eastern Jin painter Gu Kaizhi, Tang and Song painting, and the later Ming painter Shitao, thus broadening his perspective on Chinese painting traditions as well as exerting an impact on his own individual style of painting which he was able to establish in the 1940s.  First, inspired by Kinbara Seigo’s studies, Fu Baoshi started researching the history of ‘lines; in Chinese painting and developed his scholarly interest in Gu Kaizhi. Taking Gu Kaizhi’s Admonitions Scroll as a technical model, he later established his personal style of figure painting depicting female figures. Second, having studied Tang and Song painting through his Japanese professor, he tried to analyse Chinese painting history from the perspective of the painting substance such as ‘line’, ‘colour’ and ‘ink’ as well as technique, with emphasis on the use of brushwork and ink. As well as realising the importance of the works by Chan monks of the Southern Song in terms of Chinese painting history, he was attracted to the monks’ dramatic treatment of ink and their experimentation with ink tonality which became sources of inspiration for his landscape paintings after he returned from Japan. Third, inspired by the Japanese scholarship on Shitao",supervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
정도전의 헌법 사상에 대한 고찰,2016,"['정도전', '조선경국전', '헌법사상', '민본사상', '재상정치', 'Jung Do-jeon', 'Joseon Gyeonggukjeon', 'Constitutional thought', 'Idea for people', 'Prime minister politics']",,"Sambong Jeong Do-jeon is the one who has achieved the generational change in politics by liquidating the old tradition at the end of Goryeo Dynasty and establishing the new Joseon Dynasty together with Lee Seong-gye. He advocated the democracy and reigning of virtue based on Neo-Confucianism and he also pursued the prime minister politics. And to solidify the foundation of Neo-Confucianism, he insisted the Confucius view of the world by writing the book of ‘Bulssi Japbyeon’. Jeong Do-jeon tried to realize the ideal world of Neo-Confucianism in the real world and suggested the centralism based on the Confucian scripters called ‘Jurye’ and the theory of prime minister politics. The politics and constitutional system of Joseon followed his ‘Joseon Gyeonggukjeon’ and the economic system was established on the basis of his Land distribution system called ‘Gwajeonbup’. ‘Joseon Gyeonggukjeon’ is a kind of a Constitutional draft of Joseon Dynasty. And his Constitutional theory can also be found in the fact that he enacted the Constitutional foundation of new dynasty for himself. First of all, he considered the issue of political power and revolution for the theoretical justification of the power of new dynasty and discussed the political philosophy of Confucius virtue as a new governing principle, and he largely studied on the order and occupation of social classes, the selection of government officials and the education system. Most of all, he seemed to have tried to specify the role of king and the functions of ministers and government officials by discussing about how the government system should be composed basically. Actually, Jeong Do-jeon`s Constitutional theory has an important meaning that he tried to clarify the separation of powers between king and officials under the principle of centralized bureaucratic statism. His Constitutional theory for people is represented consistently also in the reality of power structures and governing bodies. He believes that the power abuse of government officials should be prevented in order to use their power as the measure for their people, and to do that, the political power should be focused on the central government absolutely. Thus, by concentrating all the sovereign power or control over people to the central government, the personal control of aristocrats can be suppressed and the supervision and checks between the government bodies can be conducted on the other hand. In other word, the former is to control the whole country by the central government and the latter is to classify the powers that the small authorities are controlled by the large authorities and the local government is controlled by the central government. This kind of system can be called as the strengthening of centralized system in short, and this idea came from the Chinese system of course. In other words, the national system which he thought was the centralized bureaucratic system which is neither the tyrannical politics nor vassal government. Jeong Do-jeon, as a representative for the power of officials, reminds us of the conflicts between the authority of the king and the power of officials, the power of officials which he insisted, is the power of people at the end. He tried to pursue the checks for the king and the balance of powers. In the East, the expulsion of tyrant by people was called as the dynastic revolution, and though he didn`t use the word of revolution, he thought that the existence of the king`s authority depends on the voluntary agreement of people. Korean`s strong spirit of criticism that anyone can always criticize the king or president’s wrong behaviors because the king with no civil support can be eliminated at any time and people is the root of nation seems to be caused from these historical experiences. Jung Do-jeon`s Revolution theory provided the theoretical basis for Joseon Dynasty. According to his theory, Lee Seong-gye could receive the crown by accepting the recognition of people`s calling rather than occupying the authority for himself. Therefore, when comparing Jung Do-jeon`s Revolution theory with the modern right of revolution, there is a fundamental difference in face. What can we learn from his theory? And the political system centering around the Prime minister, which Jung Do-jeon has insisted, was proper for the reality of Joseon Dynasty at that time? However, what Jo-seon Dynasty needed was to organize the national power through the absolute monarchy to be the modern nation, I think. In addition to this, the high evaluation toward Jung Do-jeon, especially the comparison of his political system centering around the Prime minister to the parliamentary system, seems to be the outcome of exaggeration and ignorance. In a democracy, the civil mind is measured by voting and the one who gets the more public support operates the national politics, and the term is also limited so that the administration is changed frequently. On the contrary, in the Constitutional theory of Jung Do-jeon, there are no voting or the principle of majority rule and the tenure of political power is not recognized. The only thing that can be changed by the revolution is the king with power. So his democracy can be called as a kind of trusteeship. On the other hand, regarding the issue whether the actual revolution or behavior of people against the king who broke the trust can be the right of people or not, though it is difficult to say about this definitely because his Constitutional theory didn`t establish the abstract concept of ‘Rights’, his intention should be interpreted positively I think.",supervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv

Compared with institutional investors and financial institutions, individual investors are in the weak position on information, technology equipment or professional knowledge. In order to overcome various unfavorable factors, it’s necessary to use the power of investment professionals and configure the appropriate portfolio. Thereby comes collective investment and collective investment schemes. But the reality of china’s market and the general theoretical predictions are not unanimous. China’s stock market trading volume mostly comes from retail investors. Their investment approach is generally seeking short-term interests, not valuing the potential value of the company’s growth. But due to the huge trading volume of their transactions, resulting in part of the institutional investors does not fulfill the normal value investment philosophy. Retail investors in china prefer choosing their own investment operations rather than rely on collective investment scheme that have more information, technological equipment and expertise. They must have their reasons. The collective investment scheme is the root cause of mistrust. Reflect on why this result is generated, the first consideration should be the legal institutional reasons. In order to improve the relevant legislation, it is necessary to learn from other countries. Lots of domestic legislative research on development of capital market and regulations in Europe, United States and Japan has been made, but research on Korea’s experience is so limited. This paper will focus on “Capital Market and Financial Investment Act” of Korea regarding to collective investment, try to provide useful information to china’s domestic legislatures and academics. The second part of this paper will introduce the provisions relating to collective investment on Korea’s capital market act and discuss existing problems. In force Korea’s capital market act with “collective investment” instead of the “indirect investment”, it is from the “Indirect investment asset management business act”. Compared with the past “indirect investment”, current capital market act Article 6, paragraph 5 of the collective investment made more abroad regulations. Collective investment by the collection of assets does not accept the daily use instruction, asset management approach, asset allocation using the results of four elements composing. And Korea’s capital market act Article 9, paragraph 18 to 23 set to concept of the collective investment scheme, private collective investment scheme, investment property collections, collective investment securities, collective investment contract and the investor conference. Korea’s capital market act is rich in contents, but still have many problems. This paper will focus on collective investment scheme, review the problems regarding operational structure of scheme, issuance of equity securities, corporate governance. The third part will introduce the general provisions of the UK, US and Japan on collective investment and China’s Law and regulations. We can clearly see that, China has not made unifying legislation on collective investment. Collective investment on China’s capital market presence of the problem is, although there have no unifying legislative provisions, but the competent authority of the relevant legislative acts of the executive is widespread. Trading and regulatory issues exist in collective investment have become increasingly serious. Generally there are the following points: First, provisions on financial instruments are not clear, and the legal system is disordered; Second, the various regulatory agencies operating on the same product in different settings with different rules, that resulting in unfair competition; Third, the private nature of financial products lack effective legal regulation; Fourth, the financial consumer protection problem was unfavorable and growing; Fifth, the economic environment problems resulted from the regulation of private finance. China’s current laws and regulations relating to the collection investment is the “Securities Investment Fund Act”. In order to improve the regulation of collective investment, it is necessary to adapt the method directly into a “Collective Investment Act”. While referring to the experience of other advanced countries financial legislation, it’s necessary to step up integration of financial supervision legislation.",supervised_learning_2016_academic_riss.csv
Fast Algorithm for Intra Prediction of HEVC Using Adaptive Decision Trees,2016,"['fast mode decisions', 'intra prediction', 'decision trees', 'offline training', 'HEVC']",,"High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Standard, as the latest coding standard, introduces satisfying compression structures with respect to its predecessor Advanced Video Coding (H.264/AVC). The new coding standard can offer improved encoding performance compared with H.264/AVC. However, it also leads to enormous computational complexity that makes it considerably difficult to be implemented in real time application. In this paper, based on machine learning, a fast partitioning method is proposed, which can search for the best splitting structures for Intra-Prediction. In view of the video texture characteristics, we choose the entropy of Gray-Scale Difference Statistics (GDS) and the minimum of Sum of Absolute Transformed Difference (SATD) as two important features, which can make a balance between the computation complexity and classification performance. According to the selected features, adaptive decision trees can be built for the Coding Units (CU) with different size by offline training. Furthermore, by this way, the partition of CUs can be resolved as a binary classification problem. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm can save over 34% encoding time on average, with a negligible Bjontegaard Delta (BD)-rate increase.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

The goal of this research is to assess factors linked with the 1-hour ozone exceedance through a decision tree model. Since ozone is a secondary pollutant, lag times between ozone and explanatory variables for ozone formation are taken into account in the model to improve the accuracy of the simulation. Results show that while ozone concentrations of the previous day and NO2 concentrations in the morning are major drivers for ozone exceedances in the early afternoon, meteorology plays more important role for ozone exceedances in the late afternoon. Results also show that a selection of lag times between ozone and explanatory variables affect the accuracy of predicting 1-hour ozone exceedances.

Decision tree-based data mining and rule induction for identifying hydrogeological parameters that influence groundwater pollution sensitivity,2016,"['Data mining', 'Groundwater pollution', 'Groundwater vulnerability', 'Trichloroethylene']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>This study aims to develop a new field-based approach that can estimate patterns of groundwater pollution sensitivity using data mining algorithms. Hydrogeological and pollution sensitivity data were collected from the Woosan Industrial Complex, Korea, which is a site contaminated by trichloroethylene (TCE). The proposed data mining algorithm procedure uses seven hydrogeological properties as input variables: depth to water, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, vadose zone media, and hydraulic conductivity. The observed TCE sensitivity was used as the target data. Initially, four data mining algorithms artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), case-based reasoning (CBR), and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) were tested. We found that the DT-based data mining and rule induction method shows better prediction accuracy and consistency than the other methods. We also used the ordinal pairwise partitioning (OPP) algorithm to improve the accuracy and consistency of the DT model. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis of the OPP-DT model indicated that the net recharge (R), soil media (S), and aquifer media (A) were the major hydrogeological factors that influence groundwater sensitivity to TCE at the site. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed model can provide more accurate and consistent estimates of groundwater vulnerability to TCE compared to the existing models.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  We use data mining method to estimate groundwater pollution vulnerability. </LI> <LI>  Applicability is measured using trichloroethylene and hydrogeological data. </LI> <LI>  Proposed method shows better correlation between input and target variables. </LI> <LI>  Proposed model can be used to predict groundwater vulnerability at unmeasured points. </LI> <LI>  Proposed method could be used in decision making process for environmental projects. </LI> </UL> </P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>   <P>[DISPLAY OMISSION]</P>",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

Detection of tropical cyclone genesis via quantitative satellite ocean surface wind pattern and intensity analyses using decision trees,2016,"['Tropical cyclone', 'Microwave sea surface wind', 'Dynamic pattern and intensity recognition', 'Machine learning']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Microwave remote sensing can be used to measure ocean surface winds, which can be used to detect tropical cyclone (TC) formation in an objective and quantitative way. This study develops a new model using WindSat data and a machine learning approach. Dynamic and hydrologic indices are quantified from WindSat wind and rainfall snapshot images over 352 developing and 973 non-developing tropical disturbances from 2005 to 2009. The degree of cyclonic circulation symmetry near the system center is quantified using circular variances, and the degree of strong wind aggregation (heavy rainfall) is defined using a spatial pattern analysis program tool called FRAGSTATS. In addition, the circulation strength and convection are defined based on the areal averages of wind speed and rainfall. An objective TC formation detection model is then developed by applying those indices to a machine-learning decision tree algorithm using calibration data from 2005 to 2007. Results suggest that the circulation symmetry and intensity are the most important parameters that characterize developing tropical disturbances. Despite inherent sampling issues associated with the polar orbiting satellite, a validation from 2008 to 2009 shows that the model produced a positive detection rate of approximately 95.3% and false alarm rate of 28.5%, which is comparable with the pre-existing objective methods based on cloud-pattern recognition.

Sparse Signal Recovery via Tree Search Matching Pursuit,2016,"['Compressive sensing', 'greedy algorithm', 'sparse recovery', 'tree pruning', 'tree search']",,"Recently, greedy algorithm has received much attention as a cost-effective means to reconstruct the sparse signals from compressed measurements. Much of previous work has focused on the investigation of a single candidate to identify the support (index set of nonzero elements) of the sparse signals. Well-known drawback of the greedy approach is that the chosen candidate is often not the optimal solution due to the myopic decision in each iteration. In this paper, we propose a tree search based sparse signal recovery algorithm referred to as the tree search matching pursuit (TSMP). Two key ingredients of the proposed TSMP algorithm to control the computational complexity are the pre-selection to put a restriction on columns of the sensing matrix to be investigated and the tree pruning to eliminate unpromising paths from the search tree. In numerical simulations of Internet of Things (IoT) environments, it is shown that TSMP outperforms conventional schemes by a large margin.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

We determined which bisphosphonate provides better efficacy in prevention of osteoporotic fractures using a decision analysis tool, in terms of quality of life. Methods: A decision analysis model was constructed containing final outcome score and the probability of vertebral and hip fracture within 1 year. Final outcome was defined as health-related quality of life, and was used as an utility in the decision tree. Probabilities were obtained by literature review, and health-related quality of life was evaluated by consensus committee. A roll back tool was used to determine the best bisphosphonate, and sensitivity analysis was performed to compensate for decision model uncertainty. Results: The decision model favored bisphosphonate with higher compliance in terms of quality of life. In one-way sensitivity analysis, ibandronate was more beneficial than the others, when probability of compliance on ibandronate was above 0.589.

Fast CU Partitioning Algorithm for HEVC Using an Online-Learning-Based Bayesian Decision Rule,2016,"['scene change detection', 'Bayesian decision rule', 'coding unit (CU) partitioning', 'fast mode decision', 'High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)']",,"<P>High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the state-of-the-art video coding standard. It adopts a hierarchical quad-tree-based coding unit (CU) partitioning structure that is flexible in various texture and motion characteristics of a video signal. However, the exhaustive partitioning process for finding optimal CU partitions requires a dramatic increase in computational complexity of the HEVC encoder compared with previous video coding standards. In this paper, a fast CU partitioning algorithm is proposed for HEVC encoder, which early on terminates the CU partitioning process based on the Bayesian decision rule using joint online and offline learning. An online learning method is first presented based on the minimum error Bayesian decision rule using a training picture selection method with scene change detection. Next, a joint online and offline learning method is presented, which additionally trains the loss of decision making of the proposed method based on the minimum risk Bayesian decision rule. The proposed method is implemented on an HEVC test software 15.0. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the computational complexity of HEVC encoder to 53.6% on an average with a 0.71% acceptable Bjontegaard delta bitrate loss in random access configuration. For other configurations, 48.4%, 48.5%, and 54.2% encoding time saving are obtained on an average for low delay, low delay-P, and all intra-configurations, respectively.</P>",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv
Sparse Signal Recovery via Tree Search Matching Pursuit,2016,"['Compressive sensing', 'greedy algorithm', 'sparse re- covery', 'tree pruning', 'tree search']",,"Recently, greedy algorithm has received much attentionas a cost-effective means to reconstruct the sparse signals fromcompressed measurements. Much of previous work has focusedon the investigation of a single candidate to identify the support(index set of nonzero elements) of the sparse signals. Well-knowndrawback of the greedy approach is that the chosen candidate isoften not the optimal solution due to the myopic decision in each it-eration. In this paper, we propose a tree search based sparse signalrecovery algorithm referred to as the tree search matching pursuit(TSMP). Two key ingredients of the proposed TSMP algorithm tocontrol the computational complexity are the pre-selection to put arestriction on columns of the sensing matrix to be investigated andthe tree pruning to eliminate unpromising paths from the searchtree. In numerical simulations of Internet of Things (IoT) environ-ments, it is shown that TSMP outperforms conventional schemesby a large margin.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv
CU Depth Decision Based on FAST Corner Detection for HEVC Intra Prediction,2016,"['video coding', 'HEVC', 'intra prediction', 'FAST corner detection']",,"The High efficiency video coding (HEVC) is the newest video coding standard that achieves coding efficiency higher than previous video coding standards such as H.264/AVC. In intra prediction, the prediction units (PUs) are derived from a large coding unit (LCU) which is partitioned into smaller coding units (CUs) sizing from 8x8 to 64x64 in a quad-tree structure. As they are divided until having the minimum depth, Optimum CU splitting is selected in RDO (Rate Distortion Optimization) process. In this process, HEVC demands high computational complexity. In this paper, to reduce the complexity of HEVC, we propose a fast CU mode decision (FCDD) for intra prediction by using FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) corner detection. The proposed method reduces computational complexity with 53.73% of the computational time for the intra prediction while coding performance degradation with 0.7% BDBR is small compared to conventional HEVC.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

Multiple DTs were constructed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry(DEXA) measured BF% and anthropometrics and demographics variables in training split. A parsimony DT with the lowest risk estimate was selected. The accuracy of the chosen DT was evaluated by R<sup>2</sup> and root mean square error(RMSE) against BF% measured by DEXA in testing split. The best model for estimation of BF% was a DT consisting of 5 levels and 4 predictors(risk estimate = 13.98; # of terminal nodes = 21). BF% estimated by the DT accounted for 73% of the variation in criterion-measured BF% with a RMSE of 4.03%.

And then, the Decision-tree analysis were used to explain the cause of poverty while demographic variables used as control variables. Unlike findings from a logistic regressional analysis, the study results showed a hierarchical order of variables suggested in the hypothetical model. The results showed that economic independence played the key to determine poverty as those who worked and earned wage income from the labor market are much less likely to live out of poverty.

Sort Filter Skyline (SFS) uses this strategy, but reduces the number of comparisons by calculating the entropy score of each tuple in advance. However, for large and high-dimensional database, the number of comparison in SFS significantly increases, which enlarges overall skyline computational time. In this paper, we propose to apply a decision tree approach to reduce the number of comparisons in skyline computation for large and high-dimensional data. More specifically, using decision tree approach, we generate the classification rules that can identify the tuples that are not capable of dominating the current input tuple and hence need not be considered during the comparison operation.

Categorical multivariate input data (40 variables) was used to construct a classification tree, and the target variable was biosecurity level dichotomized into low versus high.In general, the level of biosecurity was lower in the majority of farms studied, mainly due to the limited implementation of on-farm basic biosecurity measures aimed at controlling the potential introduction and transmission of swine diseases.The CHAID model illustrated the relative importance of significant predictors in explaining the level of biosecurity; maintenance of medical records of treatment and vaccination, use of dedicated clothing to enter the farm, installing fence surrounding the farm perimeter, and periodic monitoring of the herd using written biosecurity plan in place.The misclassification risk estimate of the prediction model was 0.145 with the standard error of 0.025, indicating that 85.5% of the cases could be classified correctly by using the decision rule based on the current tree.

의사결정나무를 활용한 업종별 버스 교통사고 특성 연구,2016,"['Decision Tree Method', 'CHAID Algorithm', 'Traffic Accidents', 'Bus Types']",,"PURPOSES: This study was initiated to analyze the characteristics of bus traffic accidents, by bus types, using the decision tree in order to establish customized safety alternatives by bus types, including the intra-city bus, rural area bus, and inter-city bus. METHODS: In this study, the major elements involved in bus traffic accidents were identified using decision trees and CHAID algorithm. The decision tree was used to identify the characteristics of major elements influencing bus traffic accidents. In addition, the CHAID algorithm was applied to branch the decision trees. RESULTS : The number of casualties and severe injuries are high in bus accidents involving pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles, etc. In the case of light injury caused by bus accidents, different results are found. In the case of intra-city bus accidents, the probability of light injury is of 77.2% when boarding a non-owned car and breaching of duty to drive safely are involved. In the case of rural area bus accidents, the elements showing the highest probability of light injury are boarding an owned car, vehicle-to-vehicle accidents, and breaching of duty to drive safely. In the case of intra-city bus accidents, boarding owned car, streets, and vehicle-to-vehicle accidents work as the critical elements. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the bus accident data were categorized by bus types, and then the influential elements were identified using decision trees. As a result, the characteristics of bus accidents were found to be different depending on bus types. The findings in this study are expected to be utilized in establishing effective alternatives to reduce bus accidents.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv
Object Classification Method Using Dynamic Random Forests and Genetic Optimization,2016,"['Object Classification', 'Random Forest', 'Genetic Algorithm', 'Classifier Ensemble']",,"In this paper, we proposed the object classification method using genetic and dynamic random forest consisting of optimal combination of unit tree. The random forest can ensure good generalization performance in combination of large amount of trees by assigning the randomization to the training samples and feature selection, etc. allocated to the decision tree as an ensemble classification model which combines with the unit decision tree based on the bagging. However, the random forest is composed of unit trees randomly, so it can show the excellent classification performance only when the sufficient amounts of trees are combined. There is no quantitative measurement method for the number of trees, and there is no choice but to repeat random tree structure continuously. The proposed algorithm is composed of random forest with a combination of optimal tree while maintaining the generalization performance of random forest. To achieve this, the problem of improving the classification performance was assigned to the optimization problem which found the optimal tree combination. For this end, the genetic algorithm methodology was applied. As a result of experiment, we had found out that the proposed algorithm could improve about 3~5% of classification performance in specific cases like common database and self infrared database compare with the existing random forest. In addition, we had shown that the optimal tree combination was decided at 55~60% level from the maximum trees.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv
Predicting Stock Liquidity by Using Ensemble Data Mining Methods,2016,"['Stock liquidity', 'Data-mining', 'Ensemble methods', 'decision making']",,"In finance literature, stock liquidity showing how stocks can be cashed out in the market has received rich attentions from both academicians and practitioners. The reasons are plenty. First, it is known that stock liquidity affects significantly asset pricing. Second, macroeconomic announcements influence liquidity in the stock market. Therefore, stock liquidity itself affects investors' decision and managers' decision as well. Though there exist a great deal of literature about stock liquidity in finance literature, it is quite clear that there are no studies attempting to investigate the stock liquidity issue as one of decision making problems. In finance literature, most of stock liquidity studies had dealt with limited views such as how much it influences stock price, which variables are associated with describing the stock liquidity significantly, etc. However, this paper posits that stock liquidity issue may become a serious decision-making problem, and then be handled by using data mining techniques to estimate its future extent with statistical validity. In this sense, we collected financial data set from a number of manufacturing companies listed in KRX (Korea Exchange) during the period of 2010 to 2013. The reason why we selected dataset from 2010 was to avoid the after-shocks of financial crisis that occurred in 2008. We used Fn-GuidPro system to gather total 5,700 financial data set. Stock liquidity measure was computed by the procedures proposed by Amihud (2002) which is known to show best metrics for showing relationship with daily return. We applied five data mining techniques (or classifiers) such as Bayesian network, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, neural network, and ensemble method. Bayesian networks include GBN (General Bayesian Network), NBN (Naive BN), TAN (Tree Augmented NBN). Decision tree uses CART and C4.5. Regression result was used as a benchmarking performance. Ensemble method uses two types-integration of two classifiers, and three classifiers. Ensemble method is based on voting for the sake of integrating classifiers. Among the single classifiers, CART showed best performance with 48.2%, compared with 37.18% by regression. Among the ensemble methods, the result from integrating TAN, CART, and SVM was best with 49.25%. Through the additional analysis in individual industries, those relatively stabilized industries like electronic appliances, wholesale & retailing, woods, leather-bags-shoes showed better performance over 50%.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

In psychology, there have been some previous researches studying the factors influencing romantic relationships. However, most of these researches were performed based on statistical analysis; thus they have limitations in analyzing complex non-linear relationships or rules based reasoning.  This research analyzes commitment and persistence in heterosexual involvement according to styles of loving using a datamining technique as well as statistical methods. In this research, we consider six different styles of loving - eros, ludus, stroge, pragma, mania and agape which influence romantic relationships between lovers, besides the factors suggested by the previous researches. These six types of love are defined by Lee (1977) as follows: eros is romantic, passionate love; ludus is a game-playing or uncommitted love; storge is a slow developing, friendship-based love; pragma is a pragmatic, practical, mutually beneficial relationship; mania is an obsessive or possessive love and, lastly, agape is a gentle, caring, giving type of love, brotherly love, not concerned with the self.  In order to do this research, data from 105 heterosexual couples were collected. Using the data, a linear regression method was first performed to find out the important factors associated with a commitment to partners. The result shows that satisfaction, eros and agape are significant factors associated with the commitment level for both male and female. Interestingly, in male cases, agape has a greater effect on commitment than eros. On the other hand, in female cases, eros is a more significant factor than agape to commitment. In addition to that, investment of the male is also crucial factor for male commitment.  Next, decision tree analysis was performed to find out the characteristics of high commitment couples and low commitment couples. In order to build decision tree models in this experiment, decision tree operator in the datamining tool, Rapid Miner was used. The experimental result shows that males having a high satisfaction level in relationship show a high commitment level. However, even though a male may not have a high satisfaction level, if he has made a lot of financial or mental investment in relationship, and his partner shows him a certain amount of agape, then he also shows a high commitment level to the female. In the case of female, a women having a high eros and satisfaction level shows a high commitment level. Otherwise, even though a female may not have a high satisfaction level, if her partner shows a certain amount of mania then the female also shows a high commitment level.  Finally, this research built a prediction model to establish whether the relationship will persist or break up using a decision tree. The result shows that the most important factor influencing to the break up is a narcissistic tendency of the male. In addition to that, satisfaction, investment and mania of both male and female also affect a break up. Interestingly, while the mania level of a male works positively to maintain the relationship, that of a female has a negative influence.  The contribution of this research is adopting a new technique of analysis using a datamining method for psychology. In addition, the results of this research can provide useful advice to couples for building a harmonious relationship with each other.  This research has several limitations. First, the experimental data was sampled based on oversampling technique to balance the size of each classes. Thus, it has a limitation of evaluating performances of the predictive models objectively. Second, the result data, whether the relationship persists of not, was collected relatively in short periods - 6 months after the initial data collection. Lastly, most of the respondents of the survey is in their 20s.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

In the big data age, there are too many information sources to refer to when making decisions. For example, when considering travel to a city, a person may search reviews from a search engine such as Google or social networking services (SNSs) such as blogs, Twitter, and Facebook. The emotional polarity of positive and negative reviews helps a user decide on whether or not to make a trip. Sentiment analysis of customer reviews has become an important research topic as datamining technology is widely accepted for text mining of the Web. Sentiment analysis has been used to classify documents through machine learning techniques, such as the decision tree, neural networks, and support vector machines (SVMs). is used to determine the attitude, position, and sensibility of people who write articles about various topics that are published on the Web. Regardless of the polarity of customer reviews, emotional reviews are very helpful materials for analyzing the opinions of customers through their reviews. Sentiment analysis helps with understanding what customers really want instantly through the help of automated text mining techniques. Sensitivity analysis utilizes text mining techniques on text on the Web to extract subjective information in the text for text analysis. Sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the attitudes or positions of the person who wrote the article and presented their opinion about a particular topic.  In this study, we developed a model that selects a hot topic from user posts at Chinas online stock forum by using the k-means algorithm and self-organizing map (SOM). In addition, we developed a detecting model to predict a hot topic by using machine learning techniques such as logit, the decision tree, and SVM. We employed sensitivity analysis to develop our model for the selection and detection of hot topics from China’s online stock forum. The sensitivity analysis calculates a sentimental value from a document based on contrast and classification according to the polarity sentimental dictionary (positive or negative).  The online stock forum was an attractive site because of its information about stock investment. Users post numerous texts about stock movement by analyzing the market according to government policy announcements, market reports, reports from research institutes on the economy, and even rumors. We divided the online forum’s topics into 21 categories to utilize sentiment analysis. One hundred forty-four topics were selected among 21 categories at online forums about stock. The posts were crawled to build a positive and negative text database. We ultimately obtained 21,141 posts on 88 topics by preprocessing the text from March 2013 to February 2015.

We developed a decision tree model to detect hot topics with three algorithms: CHAID, CART, and C4.5. The results of CHAID were subpar compared to the others. We also employed SVM to detect the hot topics from negative data. The SVM models were trained with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel function by a grid search to detect the hot topics.  The detection of hot topics by using sentiment analysis provides the latest trends and hot topics in the stock forum for investors so that they no longer need to search the vast amounts of information on the Web.

NOVEL LARGE SCALE SIMULATION PROCESS TO SUPPORT DOT’S CAFE MODELING SYSTEM,2016,"['Large scale simulation', 'Hybrid vehicles', 'CAFE', 'High performance computing', 'Autonomie']",,"This paper demonstrates a new process that has been specifically designed for the support of the U.S.Department of Transportation’s (DOT’s) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. In developing the standards, DOT’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration made use of the CAFE Compliance and Effects Modeling System (the “Volpe model” or the “CAFE model”), which was developed by DOT’s Volpe National Transportation Systems Center for the 2005–2007 CAFE rulemaking and has been continuously updated since. The model is the primary tool used by the agency to evaluate potential CAFE stringency levels by applying technologies incrementally to each manufacturer’s fleet until the requirements under consideration are met. The Volpe model relies on numerous technology-related and economic inputs, such as market forecasts, technology costs, and effectiveness estimates; these inputs are categorized by vehicle classification, technology synergies, phase-in rates, cost learning curve adjustments, and technology “decision trees”. Part of the model’s function is to estimate CAFE improvements that a given manufacturer could achieve by applying additional technology to specific vehicles in its product line. A significant number of inputs to the Volpe decision-tree model are related to the effectiveness (fuel consumption reduction) of each fuel-saving technology. Argonne National Laboratory has developed a fullvehicle simulation tool named Autonomie, which has become one of the industry’s standard tools for analyzing vehicle energy consumption and technology effectiveness. Full-vehicle simulation tools use physics-based mathematical equations, engineering characteristics (e.g., engine maps, transmission shift points, and hybrid vehicle control strategies), and explicit drive cycles to predict the effectiveness of individual and combined fuel-saving technologies. The Large-Scale Simulation Process accelerates and facilitates the assessment of individual technological impacts on vehicle fuel economy. This paper will show how Argonne efficiently simulates hundreds of thousands of vehicles to model anticipated future vehicle technologies.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv
Practice of causal inference with the propensity of being zero or one: assessing the effect of arbitrary cutoffs of propensity scores,2016,"['causal inference', 'propensity score', 'positivity assumption', 'classification and regression tree', 'jackknife resampling', 'inverse propensity weighting', 'random forest']",,"Causal inference methodologies have been developed for the past decade to estimate the unconfounded effect of an exposure under several key assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the stable unit treatment value assumption, the strong ignorability of treatment assignment assumption, and the assumption that propensity scores be bounded away from zero and one (the positivity assumption). Of these assumptions, the first two have received much attention in the literature. Yet the positivity assumption has been recently discussed in only a few papers. Propensity scores of zero or one are indicative of deterministic exposure so that causal effects cannot be defined for these subjects. Therefore, these subjects need to be removed because no comparable comparison groups can be found for such subjects. In this paper, using currently available causal inference methods, we evaluate the effect of arbitrary cutoffs in the distribution of propensity scores and the impact of those decisions on bias and efficiency. We propose a tree-based method that performs well in terms of bias reduction when the definition of positivity is based on a single confounder.

The  CVD and SDD models having only measures of percentiles (i.e. P24 and P93) as predictors produced better predictions  than others. However, CVD model produced the overall best predictions, because of the lower RSE and stability in  measuring variability across different stand developments. The results demonstrate the potentials of CVD in modelling  stem diameter variability in relationship with percentiles variables.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

Lack of accuracy and validity of the Korean Diagnosis Related Group and Korean Out-Patient Group for the acute patients as the case-mix and payment tool for rehabilitation inpatients have been problematic issues. The objective of the study was to develop the Korean Rehabilitation Patient Group (KRPG) reflecting the characteristics of rehabilitation inpatients. Methods: As a retrospective medical record survey regarding rehabilitation inpatients, 4,207 episodes were collected through 42 hospitals. Considering the opinions of clinical experts and the decision-tree analysis, the variables for the KRPG system demonstrating the characteristics of rehabilitation inpatients were derived, and the splitting standards of the relevant variables were also set. Using the derived variables, we have drawn the rehabilitation inpatient classification model reflecting the clinical situation of Korea. The performance evaluation was conducted on the KRPG system. Results: The KRPG was targeted at the inpatients with brain or spinal cord injury. The etiologic disease, functional status (cognitive function, activity of daily living, muscle strength, spasticity, level and grade of spinal cord injury), and the patient`s age were the variables in the rehabilitation patients. The algorithm of KRPG system after applying the derived variables and total 204 rehabilitation patient groups were developed. The KRPG explained 11.8% of variance in charge for rehabilitation inpatients. It also explained 13.8% of variance in length of stay for them.

Transarterial chemoembolization versus resection for intermediate-stage (BCLC B) hepatocellular carcinoma,2016,"['Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Intermediate stage', 'Transarterial chemoembolization', 'Resection', 'Survival']",,"Background/Aims: Several studies have suggested that surgical resection (SR) can provide a survival benefit over transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the intermediate stage according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. However, the criteria for SR remain to be determined. This study compared the long-term outcome of intermediate-stage HCC patients treated by either TACE or SR as a primary treatment modality, with the aim of identifying the patient subgroup that gained a survival benefit by either modality. Methods: In total, 277 BCLC intermediate-stage HCC patients treated by either TACE (N=225) or SR (N=52) were analyzed. Results: The overall median survival time was significantly better for SR than TACE (61 vs. 30 months, P=0.002). Decision-tree analysis divided patients into seven nodes based on tumor size and number, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, and Child-Pugh score, and these were then simplified into four subgroups (B1.B4) based on similarities in the overall hazard rate. SR provided a significant survival benefit in subgroup B2, characterized by ‘oligo’ (2.4) nodules of intermediate size (5.10 cm) when the AFP levels was <400 ng/ml, or ‘oligo’ (2.4) nodules of small to intermediate size (<10 cm) plus a Child-Pugh score of 5 when the AFP level was ≥400 ng/mL (median survival 73 vs. 28 months for SR vs. TACE respectively; P=0.014). The survival rate did not differ significantly between SR and TACE in the other subgroups (B1 and B3). Conclusions: SR provided a survival benefit over TACE in intermediate-stage HCC, especially for patients meeting certain criteria. Re-establishing the criteria for optimal treatment modalities in this stage of HCC is needed to improve survival rates. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2016;22:250-258)",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv
Real time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environments,2016,,,"<P>In recent years, the number of people using the Internet and network services is increasing day by day. On a daily basis, a large amount of data is generated over the Internet from zeta byte to petabytes with a very high speed. On the other hand, we see more security threats on the network, the Internet, websites, and the enterprise network. Therefore, detecting intrusion in such ultra-high-speed environment in real time is a challenging task. Many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are proposed for various types of network attacks using machine learning approaches. Most of them are unable to detect recent unknown attacks, whereas the others do not provide a real-time solution to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environment using Hadoop implementation. The proposed system includes four-layered IDS architecture, which consists of the capturing layer, filtration and load balancing layer, processing or Hadoop layer, and the decision-making layer. Furthermore, feature selection scheme is proposed that selects nine parameters for classification using (FSR) and (BER), as well as from the analysis of DARPA datasets. In addition, five major machine learning approaches are used to evaluate the proposed system including J48, REPTree, random forest tree, conjunctive rule, support vector machine, and Na < ve Bayes classifiers. Results show that among all these classifiers, REPTree and J48 are the best classifiers in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency. The proposed system architecture is evaluated with respect to accuracy in terms of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP), with respect to efficiency in terms of processing time and by comparing results with traditional techniques. It has more than 99 % TP and less than 0.001 % FP on REPTree and J48. The system has overall higher accuracy than existing IDSs with the capability to work in real time in ultra-high-speed big data environment.</P>",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

Furthermore, the research aimed to suggest the reason for developing customized solutions to respond properly to the various situation and features of each individuals. As a result of the Decision Tree Analysis, the degree of depression affects the suicidal risk of elderly, and the degree of satisfaction to the housing environment is a important predictive factor following the degree of depression. Also, when the elderly who suffer from the depression with low level of satisfaction to the housing environment is not satisfied with the leisure, the risk of suicide increase. Moreover, the group retaining highest risk of suicide is featured by following factors: high degree of depression, low degree of housing and leisure satisfaction, and low satisfaction of the relation with children. Nextly, according to the result of Logistic Analysis, depression, gender, satisfaction of relationship with spouse, satisfaction of relationship with children and leisure satisfaction affect the elderly suicidal risk significantly. Lastly, as a result of Artificial Neural Network Analysis, one hidden layer and three hidden nodes were identified. The Decision Tree Analysis was identified as a better model for detecting and predicting factors affecting the elderly suicidal risk, because it shows lower misclassification rate compared to the Logistic Analysis and Artificial Neural Network Analysis.

As a result of analyzing decision tree analysis, adopted factors from male middle school and female high school matches were filed goal and free throw among 6 factors, and was field goal in female middle school matches. The adopted factor in male high school matches was rebound, field goal, and assist. The highest winning probability was 94.2% when exceeding 43 rebounds and 5 assists, and this shows the importance of rebound and assist and winning probability when interaction is matched. The lowest winning probability was 10.9% when lowering 26 rebounds, and it indicates the importance of rebound.  In conclusion, there were differences by gender and school type, but field goal, free throw, rebound, assist among 6 factors of middle& high school basketball matches appeared to important factors for victory statistically. Also, differences by school type were shown because growth of middle school players was not perfect compared to high school players. In training middle school players, practices on field goal, free throw, rebound, assist are required, and it is necessary to foster responsibility on ball ownership so as to prevent from intercept. Also it is necessary to teach the importance of assist and defense as the game nears to the final match since ability differences by team are not displayed largely in the final matches of male middle& high school players.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

Typically, the contours for the extraction of pedestrians from the foreground of images are not clear due to factors including brightness and shade; furthermore, pedestrians move in different directions and interact with each other. These issues mean that the identification of pedestrians and the generation of trajectories are somewhat difficult. We propose a new method for trajectory generation regarding multiple pedestrians. The first stage of the method distinguishes between those pedestrian-blob situations that need to be merged and those that require splitting, followed by the use of trained decision trees to separate the pedestrians. The second stage generates the trajectories of each pedestrian by using the point-correspondence method; however, we introduce a new point-correspondence algorithm for which the A* search method has been modified. By using fuzzy membership functions, a heuristic evaluation of the correspondence between the blobs was also conducted.

(2) Class participation, optimism, parent monitoring, number of friends, life satisfaction, parental expectation for children`s study, home economy difficulty, other-acknowledgement of the misdeed were significant determining factors for teacher attachment. And (3) gender, self-believe, other-acknowledgement of the misdeed, class participation, life satisfaction, worrying the other people`s blame, and parent monitoring were significant determining factors for peer attachment. These results suggest that students` diverse conditions and combinations of determining factors depending on the prediction models for the types of adolescent attachment should be considered individually in methods and programs for enhancing students` attachment.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

Where the subsequent production of the item is voluntary, then the connection between the primary violation and the item produced may be regarded as broken or attenuated(an exception to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine). However, the subsequent production could be caused by threatening or actually coerced by the law enforcement agencies. Therefore the 2016 decision required the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the production was conducted voluntarily by the possessor or custodian. Otherwise the item shall not be admissible. In the 2016 decision, the Supreme Court found that the prosecution failed to prove the voluntariness of the production, so the Court regarded the submission of the item as illegal and inadmissible to the trial. This decision is thought to be the first judgment that denies the voluntariness of a production of Art. 218. In addition, the Court put the standard of the proof beyond a reasonable doubt concerning the voluntary character of the production to attenuate or break the connection of the primary illegal seizure. The holding of the decision seems to be appropriate to prevent the possible threat or coercion of the prosecution or the police to the owner, possessor, or custodian of an evidence. In addition, it would be important to differentiate a standard of proof(proof beyond a reasonable doubt, probability proof, etc) and a method of proof.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

This paper applied the learning effect to the repeated activities in a small sized apartment construction project. The result showed that there was about 10 percent of difference in duration (one approach of the total duration with learning effects in 41 days while the other without learning effect in 36.5 days). To make the comparison between the two approaches, a large number of BIM based computer simulations were generated and useful patterns were recognized using machine learning algorithm named Decision Tree (See5).

Three Data Mining models - Artificial Neural Network, Logistic, and Decision Tree - were used to identify determinants to the labor participation among one-member elderly households. The labor participation of one-member elderly households was found to have been mostly affected by their economic needs.

Improvised methods for tackling big data stream mining challenges: case study of human activity recognition,2016,,,"<P>Big data stream is a new hype but a practical computational challenge founded on data streams that are prevalent in applications nowadays. It is quite well known that data streams that are originated and collected from monitoring sensors accumulate continuously to a very huge amount making traditional batch-based model induction algorithms infeasible for real-time data mining or just-in-time data analytics. In this position paper, following a new data stream mining methodology, namely stream-based holistic analytics and reasoning in parallel (SHARP), a list of data analytic challenges as well as improvised methods are looked into. In particular, two types of decision tree algorithms, batch-mode and incremental-mode, are put under test at sensor data that represents a typical big data stream. We investigate whether and to what extent of two improvised methods-outlier removal and balancing imbalanced class distributions-affect the prediction performance in big data stream mining. SHARP is founded on incremental learning which does not require all the training to be loaded into the memory. This important fundamental concept needs to be supported not only by the decision tree algorithms, but by the other improvised methods usually at the preprocessing stage as well. This paper sheds some light into this area which is often overlooked by data analysts when it comes to big data stream mining.</P>",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

However, it gradually has become difficult to collect the demographics of Internet users because their activities are anonymous in many cases. Although the marketing department is able to get the demographics using online or offline surveys, these approaches are very expensive, long processes, and likely to include false statements. Clickstream data is the recording an Internet user leaves behind while visiting websites. As the user clicks anywhere in the webpage, the activity is logged in semi-structured website log files. Such data allows us to see what pages users visited, how long they stayed there, how often they visited, when they usually visited, which site they prefer, what keywords they used to find the site, whether they purchased any, and so forth. For such a reason, some researchers tried to guess the demographics of Internet users by using their clickstream data. They derived various independent variables likely to be correlated to the demographics. The variables include search keyword, frequency and intensity for time, day and month, variety of websites visited, text information for web pages visited, etc. The demographic attributes to predict are also diverse according to the paper, and cover gender, age, job, location, income, education, marital status, presence of children. A variety of data mining methods, such as LSA, SVM, decision tree, neural network, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors, were used for prediction model building. However, this research has not yet identified which data mining method is appropriate to predict each demographic variable. Moreover, it is required to review independent variables studied so far and combine them as needed, and evaluate them for building the best prediction model. The objective of this study is to choose clickstream attributes mostly likely to be correlated to the demographics from the results of previous research, and then to identify which data mining method is fitting to predict each demographic attribute. Among the demographic attributes, this paper focus on predicting gender, age, marital status, residence, and job. And from the results of previous research, 64 clickstream attributes are applied to predict the demographic attributes. The overall process of predictive model building is compose of 4 steps. In the first step, we create user profiles which include 64 clickstream attributes and 5 demographic attributes. The second step performs the dimension reduction of clickstream variables to solve the curse of dimensionality and overfitting problem. We utilize three approaches which are based on decision tree, PCA, and cluster analysis. We build alternative predictive models for each demographic variable in the third step. SVM, neural network, and logistic regression are used for modeling. The last step evaluates the alternative models in view of model accuracy and selects the best model. For the experiments, we used clickstream data which represents 5 demographics and 16,962,705 online activities for 5,000 Internet users. IBM SPSS Modeler 17.0 was used for our prediction process, and the 5-fold cross validation was conducted to enhance the reliability of our experiments. As the experimental results, we can verify that there are a specific data mining method well-suited for each demographic variable. For example, age prediction is best performed when using the decision tree based dimension reduction and neural network whereas the prediction of gender and marital status is the most accurate by applying SVM without dimension reduction. We conclude that the online behaviors of the Internet users, captured from the clickstream data analysis, could be well used to predict their demographics, thereby being utilized to the digital marketing.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv
Mining Based Urban Climate Disaster Index Service According to Potential Risk,2016,,,"<P>As weather observation technology develops, natural disasters such as typhoon, earthquake, and heavy snow can be easily monitored as well as basic weather elements such as temperature, precipitation, wind, and air pressure. Advanced IT enables the statistical analysis of weather information and converged weather service. A variety of studies are being performed to analyze and utilize weather, temperature, humidity, etc. by using these IT convergence technology and weather observation technology. Meteorological Administration develops and provides the weather index to help the daily life of people by using weather elements. Influence of weather on life, industry and health is calculated by using indexes to provide weather index service. The weather index services are classified into life weather index, industry weather index and health weather index according to use. Weather indexes are correlated to each other as they are calculated by using common weather elements and advanced weather index service can be provided by analyzing these association patterns. The conventional service shows difference from the actual weather situation around the user as it is calculated by using weather information measured at the observation points. To improve this, personalized service can be provided by using context information-based ontology modeling and reasoning engine. This paper intends to propose a mining-based urban climate disaster index service according to potential risk. The proposed method constructs XML files provided by Meteorological Administration and Open Data Portal in the form of a tree by using the DOM parser and preprocesses it. Emerging risks are selected among socially important issues by using disaster-related keywords and early detected by using the previously developed WebBot. The collected weather indexes are normalized to construct weather index transactions. FP-Tree for mining is used to construct the weather index frequent pattern tree and extract association sets. Natural disaster risk, social disaster risk, and life safety risk are calculated from the extracted association sets. Urban climate disaster index is calculated by considering common elements among potential risks, weather information, disaster information, and emerging risk. Experimental application is tried to develop and verify its logical validity and effectiveness of urban climate disaster index monitoring.

To predict corporate credit ratings better, various algorithms of machine learning have been proposed and applied. However, the algorithms have some limitations. First of all, they are unable to give a solution for which variables in the dataset should be considered as input variables to effectively predict a dependent variable. Also, they are easily exposed to overfitting and risk being affected by outliers and noise. In addition, they are required to tune their numerous parameters. Under this background, this study proposes the application of Random Forests(RF) to overcome the weakness of the traditional techniques. RF were designed by Leo Breiman, an American statistician and professor, and are an ensemble learning technique. This algorithm has both features originating from bagging algorithm, which is to extend a single decision tree to various decision trees, and from random input selection. The benefit of our proposed algorithm is free from an overfitting issue, and both noise and outliers in the dataset cannot have an effect on it. Thus, our model can yield high accuracy in forecasting corporate credit ratings. To validate the effectiveness of RF in predicting corporate credit ratings, we applied it to a real world dataset of corporate credit rating in Korea. The data that we used for this research consisted of various financial ratios of 1,295 corporations and their corporate credit ratings. To evaluate and compare our model with traditional methods, we used the following methods: MDA(Multiple Discriminant Analysis), ANN(Artificial Neural Network) and MSVM(Multiclass SVM). Each model’s performance was calculated by predictive accuracy based on training and validation.　Empirical results showed that RF outperforms other traditional methods from the perspective of prediction accuracy.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

Variation and Uncertainty in the Predicted Flowering Dates of Cherry Blossoms Using the CMIP5 Climate Change Scenario,2016,"['Plant phenology', 'cherry blossoms', 'global climate models', 'multi-model ensemble', 'uncertainty']",,"In this study, we analyzed changes in the predicted flowering date (PFD) for cherry blossom trees under changing climate conditions by simulating the PFDs for six sites on the Korean Peninsula between 1981 and 2010. The spatial downscaled climate data from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 scenarios of 30 global climate models (GCMs) were used in the analysis. Here, we present the range of uncertainty in the PFDs, which were calculated by comparing the simulated PFDs to the observed flowering dates. We determined that the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of PFDs from individual GCMs, at 7-15 days, were greater in range than those of the mean PFDs from multiple GCMs, at 7-8 days. During three future periods of 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100, the standard deviations (SD), the interquartile ranges (IQRs), and the relative changes in the mean predicted flowering dates (MPFDs) were calculated to quantify the uncertainty levels inherent from the climate scenarios of multiple GCMs. Distinctive changes in the SDs and IQRs of MPFD were found among the analyzed sites. The SDs increased with time between each future period in Seoul, Incheon, and Jeonju, whereas those in Daegu, Busan, and Mokpo decreased with time. In addition, the IQRs increased with time at Seoul, Incheon, Jeonju, and Daegu but not at Busan and Mokpo. The relative changes in the MPFDs at all six sites became greater with time toward the year 2100. Therefore, combining multiple GCM scenarios may not contribute largely to reduce the uncertainty in the PFDs under changing climate conditions, although it may be useful in quantifying the uncertainty in order to make better decisions based on more accurate information.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

Box-office forecasting based on sentiments of movie reviews and Independent subspace method,2016,"['Box-office forecasting', 'Motion pictures', 'Sentiment analysis', 'Movie reviews', 'Independent subspace model']",,"<P>Box-office forecasting is a challenging but important task for movie distributors in their decision making process. Many previous studies have tried to determine a way to accurately predict the box-office, but the results reported have not been satisfactory for two main reasons: (1) lack of variable diversity and (2) simplicity of forecasting algorithms. Although the importance of word-of-mouth (WOM) has consistently emphasized in past studies, only summarized information, such as volume or valence of user ratings is commonly used. In forecasting algorithms, multiple linear regression is the most popular algorithm because it generates not only predicted values but also variable significances. In this study, new box-office forecasting models are presented to enhance the forecasting accuracy by utilizing review sentiments and employing non-linear machine learning algorithms. Viewer sentiments from review texts are used as input variables in addition to conventional predictors, whereas three machine learning-based algorithms, i.e., classification and regression tree (CART), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR), are employed to capture non-linear relationship between the box-office and its predictors. In order to provide variable importance for machine learning-based forecasting algorithms, an independent subspace method (ISM) is applied. Forecasting results from six different forecasting periods show that the presented methods can make accurate and robust forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It refers to an area of computer science related to providing machines the ability to perform their own data analysis, decision making and forecasting. For example, one of the representative machine learning models is artificial neural network, which is a statistical learning algorithm inspired by the neural network structure of biology. In addition, there are other machine learning models such as decision tree model, naive bayes model and SVM(support vector machine) model. Among the machine learning models, we use SVM model in this study because it is mainly used for classification and regression analysis that fits well to our study. The core principle of SVM is to find a reasonable hyperplane that distinguishes different group in the data space. Given information about the data in any two groups, the SVM model judges to which group the new data belongs based on the hyperplane obtained from the given data set. Thus, the more the amount of meaningful data, the better the machine learning ability.  In recent years, many financial experts have focused on machine learning, seeing the possibility of combining with machine learning and the financial field where vast amounts of financial data exist. Machine learning techniques have been proved to be powerful in describing the non-stationary and chaotic stock price dynamics. A lot of researches have been successfully conducted on forecasting of stock prices using machine learning algorithms. Recently, financial companies have begun to provide Robo-Advisor service, a compound word of Robot and Advisor, which can perform various financial tasks through advanced algorithms using rapidly changing huge amount of data. Robo-Advisers main task is to advise the investors about the investors personal investment propensity and to provide the service to manage the portfolio automatically.  In this study, we propose a method of forecasting the Korean volatility index, VKOSPI, using the SVM model, which is one of the machine learning methods, and applying it to real option trading to increase the trading performance. VKOSPI is a measure of the future volatility of the KOSPI 200 index based on KOSPI 200 index option prices. VKOSPI is similar to the VIX index, which is based on S&P 500 option price in the United States. The Korea Exchange(KRX) calculates and announce the real-time VKOSPI index. VKOSPI is the same as the usual volatility and affects the option prices. The direction of VKOSPI and option prices show positive relation regardless of the option type (call and put options with various striking prices). If the volatility increases, all of the call and put option premium increases because the probability of the options exercise possibility increases. The investor can know the rising value of the option price with respect to the volatility rising value in real time through Vega, a Black-Scholess measurement index of an options sensitivity to changes in the volatility. Therefore, accurate forecasting of VKOSPI movements is one of the important factors that can generate profit in option trading.  In this study, we verified through real option data that the accurate forecast of VKOSPI is able to make a big profit in real option trading. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies on the idea of predicting the direction of VKOSPI based on machine learning and introducing the idea of applying it to actual option trading.  In this study predicted daily VKOSPI changes through SVM model and then made intraday option strangle position, which gives profit as option prices reduce, only when VKOSPI is expected to decline during daytime. We analyzed the results and tested whether it is applicable to real option trading based on SVMs prediction. The results showed the prediction accuracy of VKOSPI was 57.83% on average, and the number of position entry times was 43.2 times, which is less than half of the benchma",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

Bankruptcy Prediction Modeling Using Qualitative Information Based on Big Data Analytics,2016,"['Bankruptcy Prediction', 'Big Data Analytics', 'Text Mining', 'Sentiment Analysis', 'Artificial Neural Networks', '부도예측', '빅데이터 분석', '텍스트 마이닝', '감성 분석', '인공신경망']",,"Many researchers have focused on developing bankruptcy prediction models using modeling techniques, such as statistical methods including multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and logit analysis or artificial intelligence techniques containing artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM), to secure enhanced performance. Most of the bankruptcy prediction models in academic studies have used financial ratios as main input variables. The bankruptcy of firms is associated with firm’s financial states and the external economic situation. However, the inclusion of qualitative information, such as the economic atmosphere, has not been actively discussed despite the fact that exploiting only financial ratios has some drawbacks. Accounting information, such as financial ratios, is based on past data, and it is usually determined one year before bankruptcy. Thus, a time lag exists between the point of closing financial statements and the point of credit evaluation. In addition, financial ratios do not contain environmental factors, such as external economic situations. Therefore, using only financial ratios may be insufficient in constructing a bankruptcy prediction model, because they essentially reflect past corporate internal accounting information while neglecting recent information.  Thus, qualitative information must be added to the conventional bankruptcy prediction model to supplement accounting information. Due to the lack of an analytic mechanism for obtaining and processing qualitative information from various information sources, previous studies have only used qualitative information. However, recently, big data analytics, such as text mining techniques, have been drawing much attention in academia and industry, with an increasing amount of unstructured text data available on the web. A few previous studies have sought to adopt big data analytics in business prediction modeling. Nevertheless, the use of qualitative information on the web for business prediction modeling is still deemed to be in the primary stage, restricted to limited applications, such as stock prediction and movie revenue prediction applications. Thus, it is necessary to apply big data analytics techniques, such as text mining, to various business prediction problems, including credit risk evaluation. Analytic methods are required for processing qualitative information represented in unstructured text form due to the complexity of managing and processing unstructured text data.  This study proposes a bankruptcy prediction model for Korean small- and medium-sized construction firms using both quantitative information, such as financial ratios, and qualitative information acquired from economic news articles. The performance of the proposed method depends on how well information types are transformed from qualitative into quantitative information that is suitable for incorporating into the bankruptcy prediction model. We employ big data analytics techniques, especially text mining, as a mechanism for processing qualitative information. The sentiment index is provided at the industry level by extracting from a large amount of text data to quantify the external economic atmosphere represented in the media. The proposed method involves keyword-based sentiment analysis using a domain-specific sentiment lexicon to extract sentiment from economic news articles. The generated sentiment lexicon is designed to represent sentiment for the construction business by considering the relationship between the occurring term and the actual situation with respect to the economic condition of the industry rather than the inherent semantics of the term.  The experimental results proved that incorporating qualitative information based on big data analytics into the traditional bankruptcy prediction model based on accounting information is effective for enhancing the predictive performance.

In this paper, the Hogno Khaan protected area in Mongolia was selected as the study area, and a quantitative method for assessing land cover change and desertification assessment was developed using Landsat TM/ETM+ data on a local scale. In this method, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), TGSI (Topsoil Grain Size Index), and land surface albedo were selected as indicators for representing land surface conditions from vegetation biomass, landscape pattern, and micrometeorology. A Decision Tree (DT) approach was used to assess the land cover change and desertification of the Hogno Khaan protected area in 1990, 2002, and 2011. Our analysis showed no correlation between NDVI and albedo or TGSI but high correlation between TGSI and albedo. Strong correlations (0.77-0.92) between TGSI and albedo were found in the non-desertification areas. The TGSI was less strongly correlated with albedo in the low and non desertification areas, at 0.70 and 0.92; respectively. The desertification of the study area is increasing each year; in the desertification map for 1990-2002, there is a decrease in areas of zero and low desertification, and an increase in areas of high and severe desertification. From 2002 to 2011, areas of non desertification increased significantly, with areas of severe desertification also exhibiting increase, while areas of medium and high desertification demonstrated little change.

The number of patients requiring revascularization was determined based on the severity of coronary stenosis as assessed by CCTA. This was compared to the actual number of revascularization procedures performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.Results: Based on CCTA findings, coronary revascularization was indicated in 877 (48%) and not indicated in 969 (52%) patients. Of the 877 patients indicated for revascularization by CCTA, only 600 (68%) underwent the procedure, whereas 285 (29%) of the 969 patients not indicated for revascularization, as assessed by CCTA, underwent the procedure.

Host-based intrusion detection system for secure human-centric computing,2016,,,"<P>With the advancement of information communication technology, people can access many useful services for human-centric computing. Although this advancement increases work efficiency and provides greater convenience to people, advanced security threats such as the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack have been continuously increasing. Technical measures for protecting against an APT attack are desperately needed because APT attacks, such as the 3.20 Cyber Terror and SK Communications hacking incident, have occurred repeatedly and cause considerable damage, socially and economically. Moreover, there are limitations of the existing security devices designed to cope with APT attacks that continue persistently using zero-day malware. For this reason, we propose a malware detection method based on the behavior information of a process on the host PC. Our proposal overcomes the limitations of the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems. First, we defined 39 characteristics for demarcating malware from benign programs and collected 8.7 million characteristic parameter events when malware and benign programs were executed in a virtual-machine environment. Further, when an executable program is running on a host PC, we present the behavior information as an 83-dimensional vector by reconstructing the frequency of each characteristic parameter's occurrence according to the process ID for the collected characteristic parameter data. It is possible to present more accurate behavior information by including the frequency of characteristic parameter events occurring in child processes.

In the last 6 years, claims of the infringement of human rights when being arrested have increased significantly, resulting in a decrease in the number of arrests made, and an increase in the search and seizure of evidence so as to ensure that any arrests made are just. With technological advances being made every day, and technology becoming an ever more prominent part of everyday life, it is natural that digital evidence and data is more important now than it has ever been in the past.On a number of occasions in recent years, during the search and seizure of digital data, prosecutors have unintentionally identified or discovered evidence of a second crime outside of that being investigated. Following the tenets of substantial truth, the evidence might be argued to be valid in a resulting investigation of the second crime. On the other hand, according to procedural truth, and as has been ruled in the Supreme Court, such evidence has been deemed to be inadmissible in court due to a lack of a warrant for the investigation of that specific crime at the time the evidence was found. In line with the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, the discovery of such evidence during an investigation has the potential to not only hinder an investigation of the second crime, but also derail the original investigation due to an, albeit unintentionally, illegal and unwarranted search.The participation of a lawyer from the company being investigated in the seizure and search procedure of electronic information or information storage devices is an issue worthy of discussion in developing fairer and more effective procedures for both those investigating and being investigated. Having an in-house lawyer present and participating in the seizure of data might ensure that correct procedures are followed, and that searches remain within the boundaries of the warrant issued for the seizure. This paper also argues that such participation is not only necessary for the original seizure of data, but also for the creation of any copies of the data being made throughout the investigation, so as to ensure the legality of any seizure and analysis of data.A previous investigation found that the majority of in-house lawyers in companies were not well-informed of the correct procedure to be followed in the case of the seizure of data from their company; thus, often leading to the absence of participation which lies at the heart of this issue. In South Korea, the issue of urgency in the seizure of data relating to a crime has also been raised as the reason for the regular omission of participation. While urgency may certainly play a factor in the effective seizure of data, a Supreme Court judge declared, last year, that any seizure of data requires a warrant specific to the crime to which the data relates. It should be noted, that the prosecution has decried this decision, arguing that the application for a second warrant would counter the effectiveness of urgent data collection and allow those subject to the seizure of the newly found evidence to cover it up or get rid of it before the new warrant is approved.This paper argues for the need for the development and creation of clear guidelines related to the procedures to be followed by in-house lawyers in the event of a seizure of data, and to expressly inform companies about said guidelines so as to ensure the timely, effective, and legal seizure of data in all cases.",decision_tree_2016_academic_riss.csv

To do this task, the following steps are done. Firstly, an RGB color image of the fish is obtained by the CCD color camera and then converted from RGB to HSI. Secondly, the S channel is extracted from HSI color space. Thirdly, by applying the K-means clustering algorithm to the HSI color space and applying the Otsu’s threshold algorithm to the S channel of HSI color space, the binary images are obtained. Fourthly, morphological processes such as dilation and erosion, etc. are applied to the binary image. Fifthly, to count the number of pixels, the connected-component labeling is adopted and the defined injured rate is gotten by calculating the pixels on the labeled images. Finally, to compare the performances of the proposed two measurement methods based on the K-means clustering algorithm and the Otsu’s threshold algorithm, the edge detection of the final binary image after morphological processing is done and matched with the gray image of the original RGB image obtained by CCD camera. The results show that the detected edge of injured part by the K-means clustering algorithm is more close to real injured edge than that by the Otsu’ threshold algorithm.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Also, as corporate governance has recently become a key component as part of the corporate sustainability management, this study explores whether corporate governance affects foreign investments.  Based on the analysis, first, it shows that foreign investments significantly increase after K-IFRS adoption. This can be attributed to the reduction in both costs for information processing by foreign investors and information asymmetry between managers and foreign investors.  Second, apart from IFRS adoption, foreign investments significantly increase as the quality of corporate governance are higher. All of the governance factors such as protection of shareholders"" rights, board characteristics, disclosure, audit characteristics, and business performance distribution. As the corporate governance efficiently controls the manager, information asymmetry between the management and investors decreases, attracting more foreign investments.  Third, with regard to individual item among corporate governance items companies with more functions of their board of directors are related to more foreign investments after K-IFRS adoption.   Fourth, the effect of a firm size on foreign investments reduces after K-IFRS adoption. This means that the characteristics of IFRS affect SME companies more than large companies, indicating that information asymmetry decreases much more for the former.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

When Korean firms adopt K-IFRS, in order to aid investors in evaluating corporate performance over time, Korean companies must restate their 2010 K-GAAP financial statements applied by K-IFRS. These two sets of financial statements for 2010 are thus based on identical underlying economic activities and are fully specified according to two different accounting system: K-GAAP and K-IFRS. In here, K-IFRS reconciliation is very important issue because they can affect accounting numbers in the first financial statement applied K-IFRS, as well as to have long-term effects on future K-IFRS financial statements. However, K-IFRS reconciliation allows managers to exercise their accounting discretion, suggesting that this reconciliation could be used as a mean to opportunistic accounting choice. In that sense, if K-IFRS reconciliation can be used as a device for managerial pursuit of self-interests, the usefulness of financial statement applied K-IFRS can be diminished.The objective of this study is to investigates the impact of K-IFRS reconciliations on the value relevance of accounting information under the K-IFRS regime. Specifically, we examine whether K-IFRS reconciliation would improve or reduce the value relevance of financial statement information applied K-IFRS during the period from 2011 to 2014. The results of empirical analyses show that the explanatory power of K-IFRS based accounting earnings and net book value for the stock price tend to be reduced by K-IFRS reconciliation. This result indicates that managers are likely to use the adjustments process to reconcile K-GAAP accounting numbers with corresponding K-IFRS as means to realize the various private utility. The evidence obtained herein suggests the need for more rigid screening schemes for the K-IFRS reconciliation process and also for adequate measures to be taken to ensure that the interests of the outside investors are properly protected.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

First, IFRS variable has not significant sign but OVERSEAS1 and OVERSEAS2 variable has significant sign in correlation and regression analysis to RM. It is means K-IFRS adoption has not effect to RM but overseas expansion variable, which is a sort of environment or business characteristic, is important variable to RM.  Second, IFRS×OVERSEAS1 variable has positive sign to RM2, RM3. It implies export firms managers upgrade RM1 and RM2 since K-IFRS adoption. IFRS×OVERSEAS2 variable has negative sign to RM1. It implies managers with overseas assets downgrade RM1 since K-IFRS adoption.  OVERSEAS(overseas expansion) is significant sign to RM, but partially, not in all RM since K-IFRS adoption. Also sign direction is different according to type of OVERSEAS. It is means firms manager select part and direction to RM.

However, Kayo is replaced by “K-Pop” which discards Korea’s musical identity and historical context. This elimination is due to K-Pop’s target of musical globalization. Instead, it took on contents of American popular music and gained musical universality. The proofs of musical universality are individual emotion’s expression regardless of local character and dance oriented music by means of trans- media strategy. These traits maximize economic profit.

K-IFRS 도입 이후 활동분류를 이용한 영업현금흐름 조정: 유인 및 회사채 신용등급에 미친 영향,2016,"['국제회계기준', '영업현금흐름조정', '활동분류', '회사채 신용등급', 'IFRS', 'operating cash flows management', 'classification', 'credit rating']",,"Since 2011 in which the IFRS was first adopted by Korean listed companies, a discretion is granted to managers when classifying cash receipts and payments of interest and dividends on the statement of cash flows. On one hand, this discretion is expected to improve the quality of accounting information by allowing managers to reflect the economic substance of those cash flows in categorizing them. On the other hand, a possibility opens up that managers could employ the discretion as a means of managing operating cash flows(CFOs). The main purpose of this study is to identify those firms who use the discretion in a way to increase CFOs, and investigate their incentives. Unlike prior studies that only examine the firms who classify interest payments as financing activities, this study analyzes not only these firms of the prior studies but also the firms who classify the receipts of interest and dividends as investing activities. Further, the analysis of this study is confined only to those firms who are subject to credit ratings because CFOs are one of the most important factors that the credit-rating agencies consider in determining firms’ ratings. It is well known in the literature that earnings are superior to CFOs as a summary measure of firm performance (Dechow 1994). However, in specific situations CFOs could provide information that earnings can seldom do. For example, the payment of interests and the principal is ensured if the debt-issuing firms can generate a stable stream of cash flows from operations. Bond investors will thus consider CFOs more important than earnings in making decisions. Further, firms’ ability to generate an adequate amount of CFOs is taken into account as one of the most important factors when credit-rating agencies analyze firms’ credit-worthiness and assign ratings (Standard & Poor``s 2008; Nice Rating 2015). This implies that firms who receive credit ratings will be concerned about how to present CFOs on the statement of cash flows. Specifically, we posit that firms with lower ratings will have stronger incentives to inflate CFOs with intent to receive good ratings. We thus first hypothesize that after the initial adoption of the IFRS, Korean firms with lower credit ratings are more likely to classify cash receipts and payments of interest and dividends in a way to boost CFOs. Furthermore, a downgrade below ‘investment grade’ causes severe economic consequences such as a violation of debt covenants or a failure to raise equity capital. Thus, we additionally hypothesize that the management of CFOs would be more pronounced for the firms who are in the proximity of the borderline between ‘investment’ and ‘non-investment’ grade. Out of 960 firms for the period from 2011 to 2014, we find 190 classifying interest payments as financing instead of operating activities. Included in the 190 firms are those that classify interest and dividend receipts as investing rather than operating activities, and it is not conceptually obvious whether these firms intentionally manage CFOs because such classification of interest and dividend receipts is not entirely consistent with maximizing CFOs. However, provided that the amount of interest payments is substantially larger than the interest and dividend received, we could presume that these firms may have intent to manage CFOs because the net effect of such classification works for increasing CFOs. Accordingly, the firms that are deemed to manage CFOs include the following two groups: 1) the firms that classify interest payments as financing, but interest and dividend receipts as operating activities, and 2) the firms that categorize all cash interest and dividend items as non-operating activities and for which the ratio of interest payments to the receipts of cash interest and dividend falls in the top quartile of the full sample (or alternatively the firms for which the ratio is greater than the median). The main results of the study are as follows. First, we find that firms with lower credit ratings are more likely to increase CFOs via the discretionary classification of receipts and payments of interest and dividends. In particular, we document that firms whose ratings fall on the border line between investment and non-investment grade have stronger incentives to increase CFOs. Interestingly, however, such empirical phenomena are not statistically significant for the firms who classify interest payments as financing activities: i.e., the firms that are deemed to manage CFOs in prior studies. Our result suggests that firms with intent to inflate CFOs would consider all cash items, not just cash interest payments, which managers have discretions under the IFRS to categorize on the cash flow statement. Our findings in the main analyses indirectly signify that firms with lower credit ratings manage CFOs in anticipation that they may receive better ratings by doing so than they would otherwise do. So, in an additional analysis, we investigate whether such anticipation is fulfilled ex post. We find to the contrary that the credit-rating agencies discount the ratings of the firms who engage in the management of CFOs. This result suggests that the credit-rating agencies see through the incentives of the firms who manage CFOs and respond negatively. It also indicates that the expectations of the CFOs-managing firms are not rational in light of the rational-expectations theory in which every economic agent’s expectations are fulfilled in equilibrium. We view our empirical result as an off-equilibrium phenomenon, which may be justified by the fact that the adoption of the IFRS is a first-time experience to Korean managers. As learning is gained by the market participants, this transitory off-equilibrium phenomenon will disappear.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

First, we found that cost of capital significantly decrease since IFRS adoption but we couldn`t find evidence compare with non －global firm, cost of capital for global firm decrease significantly. Secondly, this study shows value relevance of BV in global firms have been significantly decrease compare with non－global firms, while value relevance of NI significantly increase since IFRS adoption. It is means information on NI have reliability in global firms than non －global firms with IFRS adoption. Also, global firms have negative sign to firm value(TQ：market value/book value) since IFRS adoption, it can be informed non－global firms have benefit than global firms with IFRS adoption.

Association means not only Socialism as an Idea but also an ideal of Socialism. He persuasively demonstrates his assertion by use of a transcendental critique and Transcendental Philosophy, i.e. Transcritique. His philosophical grounds are from Immanuel Kant`s Critique of pure Reason and K. Marx`s Theory of Capitalism. In other words, it is a self-critique of reason, a contradiction of capital and a relation of them.

However, the Korean Peninsula, including the North Korea remains could not be included at all in the Chinese development policy and framework in terms of the International Logistics. Currently it is raised between Korea-China rail ferry system again and that is when we need to make effective policy development on international multimodal transport system in Northeast Asia. This paper introduces the K-LB (Korea LandBridge) as its execution plan and conducted a feasibility study on this. K-LB consists of a Korea-Russian train ferry system based in Pohang Yeongil New Port(light-wing) and a Korea-China train ferry system based in Saemangeum New Port(left-wing). These two wings are linked to the existing rail system in Korea.  This study is convinced that the K-LB is an effective international logistics system in the current terms and conditions and also demonstrated that it is feasible to introduce th K-LB on the peninsula. More strictly speaking, through a linear programming under objective function that minimize the transport cost quantified prior to demonstrate the feasibility, the available ranges and conditions for the transportation costs that are ensured the effectiveness of the K-LB are presented as results. According to the results, if the transport cost of K-LB is cheaper about 34.5% than that of sea transport such as container transport, the object goods may be transported by K-LB on this route. It means that the K-LB system has a competitive advantage due to more rapid customs clearance as well as omitted loading and unloading procedures over container transportation system. It also noted that the threshold level may not be large. Therefore, K-LB has competitive enough to prove its introduction in the Northeast Asian logistics system.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

A way to increase K-SURE’s export insurance recoveries through arbitration by subrogation,2016,"['Export insurance', 'Subrogation by insurer', 'Arbitration by subrogation', 'Assignment of claim']",,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to utilize the concept of arbitration by subrogation as a means to increase recoveries of indemnities paid out to exporters or any financial institutions by K-SURE, an export credit agency of Korea, against possible non-payment or breach of obligations from the buyer or the buyer’s country. It looks into the possibility of K-SURE and KCAB reactivating its 2004 MOU to give more jurisdictional protection to K-SURE’s indemnities recovery transactions.Design/methodology/approach – This paper first introduces a brief elucidation about export insurance provided by K-SURE and the necessity of arbitration in the export insurance, and a summary of a subrogation arbitration case referred to the KCAB by K-SURE in 2005. Cognizant of the 2004 MOU between K-SURE and KCAB, as well as the foreign and domestic developments in arbitration, the paper then analyzes legal principles of subrogation by insurer, as well as domestic and overseas precedents on the matters of assignment of claim and arbitration by subrogation.Findings – While it appears that there is still no universally recognized authority nor established court precedents applying arbitration by subrogation, the authors discovered that similar to Korea, most of leading courts in the world have consistently held that the assignee can request and be requested for arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement contained in the assigned contract.The paper concludes that the K-SURE now can be admitted as a party having proper standing in the arbitration proceedings so long as the specific claim right under the contract which includes the arbitration agreement is assigned to the K-SURE.Originality/value – This paper suggests a possible plan to increase recoveries in export insurance. The outcome of the research is expected to enhance the arbitration system on the back of increasing numbers of arbitration related to export insurance, to improve the balance sheet of K-SURE and ultimately, to help the Korean economy by collecting export insurance recoveries which will lead to saving Korean people’s tax.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

MTT test results revealed that the viability of MKN-45 and TE-1 cells treated with BCE gradually decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, with significant effects achieved after 12 h of treatment. MKN-45 and TE-1 cells clearly showed characteristics of apoptosis: shrinkage, cytoplasmic condensation, and formation of cytoplasmic filaments, even partial detachment. In addition, these results showed MKN-45 cells showed a higher level of apoptosis than TE-1 cells when treated with BCE. Western blot assays showed that the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased in both MKN-45 and TE-1 cells, indicating that BCE induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. In addition, BCE-induced apoptosis was mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction involving the PI3K/Akt pathway in both MKN-45 and TE-1 cells. However, BCE-induced cell apoptosis was mediated by the Fas receptor pathway in MKN-45 cells but not in TE-1 cells. BCE-induced apoptosis in MKN-45 cells was associated with the MAP-kinase signaling pathway through the activation of p38 and JNK and the inactivation of Erk1/2. However, it was associated with the MAP-kinase signaling pathway only by means of activation of p38 and JNK in TE-1 cells.

Two main research questions are examined in this study. The first question is how the number of titles of account on the statement of financial position has changed after adoption of K-IFRS. The second question is how the number of footnote disclosures on the statement of financial position has changed after adoption of K-IFRS.Main results of this study are summarized as follows. First, the number of asset items presented separately on the statement of financial position were decreased 63.66% on average, from 44.85 to 16.3. The number of liability  items were decreased 30.26% on average, from 19.00 to 13.25.  The number of owner's equity  items were decreased 56.29% on average, from 17.02 to 7.44. Second, the number of footnote disclosures on the statement of financial position were increased significantly after adoption of K-IFRS. The number of footnote disclosures on Asset were decreased from 21.77 to 27.34 on average. The number of footnote disclosures on Liability were increased from 14.56 to 19.12 on average. However, the number of footnote disclosures on Owner’s equity were decreased from 9.10 to 5.09 on average. Third, there are still many items that their meanings are same but their names of title are different after adoption of K-IFRS.Implications from this study are as follows. First, the adoption of K-IFRS made firm's accounting disclosures simplify and  made firm's  quantitative criterion to decide the separate presentation of titles of account more rigid when compared with K-GAAP. Second, it is necessary to standardize the name of titles of account to improve the comparability and understanding of financial statements.This study was based on the individual statement of financial position. In the future research, it is necessary to examine accounting disclosures including consolidated financial statements.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The participants were 509 elementary school children(309 boys and 200 girls) who lived in child welfare institutions. They were assessed using the Korean ADHD Rating Scale(K-ARS) and K-CBCL 6-18. Only five scales of the K-CBCL 6-18 related with attention were used for analysis: syndrom total, externalizing total, aggressive behavior, attention problems and DSM-oriented ADHD scales. The results were as follows. First, K-ARS and K-CBCL 6-18 had significantly positive correlations with all five scales. Second, as a result of a t-test on the ADHD and the non-ADHD groups, which were divided using K-ARS, the mean scores of ADHD group were significantly higher than the non-ADHD group for all five scales of the K-CBCL 6-18. The hit rate of all five scales of the K-CBCL 6-18 was 60 to 70 percent. The syndrom total and externalizing total scales had high sensitivity, whereas the aggressive behavior, attention problems, and the DSM-oriented ADHD scales had high specificity. In addition, all scales had high positive predictive values. Third, as the result of a t-test on the ADHD group and the emotional disorder group, there were significant difference in the mean scores of the attention problems and the DSM-oriented ADHD scales. The attention problems and the DSM-oriented ADHD scales had a similar percentage of hit rate, high specificity and low sensitivity.

The result of this study is as follows. First, for the separate financial statements, the value relevance of net profit was high in the K－IFRS introduction period and the value relevance of BPS was high during post－K－IFRS. In the consolidated financial statements, the value relevance of net profit was relatively high during the K－IFRS introduction period and the value relevance of BPS showed to be relatively higher after introducing the K－IFRS. Second, having analyzed the corporate value explanation ability of performance measurements, IBCTPS and OIPS showed to have high relevance to shares before and after adopting KIFRS, respectively, for separate financial statements. And EPS was analyzed to have the highest relevance to shares in the pre－and post－K－IFRS periods for consolidated financial statements. For separate financial statements, IBCTPS was used as the most significant financial performance measurement in the pre－K－IFRS period, but after K－IFRS was adopted, OIPS was the major financial performance measurement used in decision－making. This can be interpreted to mean that in the post－K－IFRS period, OIPS best explains shares, among various performance measurements, in the separate financial statements of a governing corporation excluding its subordinate companies.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

From literary and filmic depictions as black-caped, coffin-dwelling creatures of the night, in recent years vampires have come to live among us. Rather than being seen as threatening predators, contemporary vampires have found ways to live among humans, and are now students, have jobs, have families, and contribute to society. And yet their difference from mortals and their special capabilities give this “new vampire,” often stronger and immortal, the option to do good or evil within human society. The “K-vampire,” the new vampire with a Korean twist, has largely taken shape in the last decade, borrowing primarily from Western examples but also taking a uniquely Korean phenotype. Some of the recent K-vampires are professionals, indeed doctors, priests, prosecutors, and private detectives. In this essay, I focus on the OCN television series Vampire Prosecutor (Season 1, 2011) to explore the meaning of a vampire in the role of a law-enforcer, of a professional tasked with maintaining law and order in human society. The series operates as an explicit critique of corruption in Korean society, and the character in the title role is an impeccable prosecutor who believes in the absolute rule of law despite the prevailing surroundings. What are the options for rule by law in a society where most legal officials may be corrupt, and what does it mean that a vampire is placed in the title role to fight such corruption?",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The purpose of this study is to investigate the metaphysical characteristics of his nature poems from many other angles. I intended to extend scope of existing research that has been limited to LaoZhuang thoughts(老莊思想) and Buddhism.  Ontic concept of self is highlighted in Lee Seong-Seon""s poems. According to his poem""s statement, the absolute being exists in the inner self and we can reach nirvana via awareness of true self. This character of self is opposed to theory of absence of ego in Buddhism, it is approximation to Atman of Upanishad.  At the same time, the absolute being in his poems have many similarities with Brahman that is regarded as a source of all things, also omnipresent in nature of heaven and earth. These properties of source and omnipresence make him equate nature with the ultimate truth of universe and self. In his poems a oneness with nature has meaning of seeking after truth because of this.  Beomairyeo(梵我一如) thought of Upanishad formed thematic consciousness of his poems, also offered a fundamental vision of nature. These lead us to the conclusion that thought of Upanishad provided a foundation for his unique metaphysical nature poems.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The cumulative percent contribution and cumulative multiple regression coefficients for vitamin K intake from each food were computed. Twenty-five foods items were selected for the FFQ to assess vitamin K intake. The FFQ was validated against intakes derived from a 5-day food record (5DR) (n = 48). To assess the reliability of the FFQ, participants completed the self-administered FFQ (FFQ1) and a second FFQ (FFQ2) after a 6-month period (n = 54). Data were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficients, the cross-classification method, and Bland-Altman plots. Mean intakes were similar for vitamin K between the FFQ and dietary records, with significant correlations observed (r = 0.652), and cross-classification analyses demonstrated no major misclassification of participants into intake quartiles. Bland-Altman plots showed no serious systematic bias between the administrations of the two dietary assessment methods over the range of mean intakes. FFQ reliability was high, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.560.

The quasi-periodicities include Rieger, Rieger type and quasi-biennial. The presence of quasi-periodicities and the mean values of the periods are confirmed by the maximum entropy method (MEM). The temporal spans of the quasi-periodicities during different solar cycles are determined from the complex Morlet-wavelet analyses. The Rieger quasi-periodicity (150-160 days) appeared during cycle 21 and cycle 22. Each of the quasi-periodicities in the studied range lies close to one or more planetary periodicities (orbital, or spring tidal, or heliocentric conjunction frequency). We discuss possible interpretations of our results, and those of similar results obtained earlier by other authors, towards understanding the mechanisms of excitation of various quasi-periodicities detected in solar variability parameters.</P>",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The achievement has laid an institutional foundation for the preservation and transmission of the folk song, including the constant discovery of and support for regional variations. What’s more, in keeping with the nationwide initiative to promote cultural content in recent years, continued efforts have been made to share and spread the values of Arirang. The popularity of the song that is recognized as both a National and a World’s Important Intangible Cultural asset is now expected to help increase the number of the Arirang festivals.The Arirang Festival still has a long way to go. If the festival is to compete on a level playing field with other regional events, there is a need to transform the way it is organized and performed. The oral literature means the oral culture and plays an integral role in creating local culture. In fact, the cultural festival is required to turn itself into something that combines yesterday and today while focusing on its originality, the biggest contributor to its inscription. In other words, the efforts to transform the current festival should be done in such a way that meets the needs of the participants by consistently seeking the distinctive values of Arirang. Changing the criteria for performance evaluation of the festival and encouraging an active, local participation into the content development can be a way. At the same time, the competitiveness of the festival for an amusing community should be further sharpened. Seeking a way to share the oral literature with more people is also required.The popularity of the Arirang festivals that now take the form of a comprehensive theme park has increased notably among regions where the song was originated. The festivals that named after their originating provinces are necessary to discover new killer content based on a certain theme while making multifaceted approach to preservation, restoration and transmission of their original values. The content might include Silgyeong (scenic background) Musical, acoustic holograms, B-boy Madang Nori and Jadam Arirang. Partnering with the Arirang Museum and Arirang training centers will also be helpful in systematically developing the new content. In doing so, the development should focus not only on academic but practical achievements (cultural content and storytelling resources), which can make contributions to the improvement of local communities and quality of their people’s lives. The resources can be found in orally transmitted laugh, emotional fun, shared creativity and a sense of happiness for healing. When it comes to utilizing the oral literature and resources, places and regions are the first thing to consider.The Korean Wave festivals led by K-Arirang is expected to play a critical role in promoting communication and sympathy not only in Korea but countries across the world. Despite the booming K-culture in recent years, most of the participants of numerous Arirang festivals are locals from their respected regions. However, given the increasing popularity of K-pop songs worldwide, the K-Arirang festivals have the potential to gain such popularity. It is also likely that such festivals can be held between the North and the South, Korea and China and even Japan. In fact, the North-South Korea Arirang festival fits exactly the spirit of the Arirang.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The proposed method consists of drawing a sample by Sethi's (1968) balanced systematic sampling, and estimating the population mean by the least squares regression estimation method, in which the sampling unit number is used as the explanatory variable. The proposed method was compared with existing methods under the expected mean square error criterion based on Cochran's (1946) infinite superpopulation model. Being compared with methods which use simple sample means, the proposed method was shown to be more efficient as the variance sigma^2 of the random error term of the superpopulation model is smaller.

Coordinated Cognitive Tethering in Dense Wireless Areas,2016,"['Graph coloring', 'interference management', 'k- means clustering', 'resource allocation', 'white spaces']",,"This paper examines the resource gain that can be obtained from the creation of clusters of nodes in densely populated areas. A single node within each such cluster is designated as a “hotspot”; all other nodes then communicate with a destination node, such as a base station, through such hotspots. We propose a semi-distributed algorithm, referred to as coordinated cognitive tethering (CCT), which clusters all nodes and coordinates hotspots to tether over locally available white spaces. CCT performs the following these steps: (a) groups nodes based on a modified k-means clustering algorithm; (b) assigns white-space spectrum to each cluster based on a distributed graph-coloring approach to maximize spectrum reuse, and (c) allocates physical-layer resources to individual users based on local channel information. Unlike small cells (for example, femtocells and WiFi), this approach does not require any additions to existing infrastructure. In addition to providing parallel service to more users than conventional direct communication in cellular networks, simulation results show that CCT can increase the average battery life of devices by 30%, on average.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

No-reference Image Quality Assessment With A Gradient-induced Dictionary,2016,"['Image quality assessment', 'no-reference', 'dictionary', 'K-means clustering', 'SVM']",,"Image distortions are typically characterized by degradations of structures. Dictionaries learned from natural images can capture the underlying structures in images, which are important for image quality assessment (IQA). This paper presents a general-purpose no-reference image quality metric using a GRadient-Induced Dictionary (GRID). A dictionary is first constructed based on gradients of natural images using K-means clustering. Then image features are extracted using the dictionary based on Euclidean-norm coding and max-pooling. A distortion classification model and several distortion-specific quality regression models are trained using the support vector machine (SVM) by combining image features with distortion types and subjective scores, respectively. To evaluate the quality of a test image, the distortion classification model is used to determine the probabilities that the image belongs to different kinds of distortions, while the regression models are used to predict the corresponding distortion-specific quality scores. Finally, an overall quality score is computed as the probability-weighted distortion-specific quality scores. The proposed metric can evaluate image quality accurately and efficiently using a small dictionary. The performance of the proposed method is verified on public image quality databases. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric can generate quality scores highly consistent with human perception, and it outperforms the state-of-the-arts.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

In the clustering-based method, it is assumed that normal data samples are close to the centers of clusters and those of abnormal are far from the centers. After partitioning training samples collected from normal target systems, fault scores (FSs) are assigned to unseen samples according to the distances between the samples and their closest cluster centroids.Alarm signals are generated if the FSs exceed predefined threshold values. The validity of exponentially weighted moving average to reduce false alarms is also investigated. To verify the performance, the proposed method is applied to failure cases due to boiler tube leakage. The experiment results show that the proposed method can detect the abnormal conditions of the target system successfully.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

InŚlokavārttika, He asserts that the knowledge is not able to have itself as the object of cognition without another means of cognition. In other words, he denies the aspect of knowledge itself (svābhāsa) that is the grasping aspect (grāhakākāra) of knowledge in the two forms (dvirūpatā) of knowledge, the basic theory bringing into self-awareness theory of Yogacāra’s position of Dharmakīrti.In PV II 448-454, Dharmakīrtiexamines the cases that other means of cognition are required to cognize pleasure etc. and points out the irrationalities.According toDharmakīrti’s view, if there is another means of cognition for feeling pleasure, people should feel the feeling as much as what a person feels because each person can cognize personal feelings by another means of cognition. Mīmāṃsā says that though different person’s means of cognition has the same object of cognition, the personal pleasure etc. harmonizes with personal ātman, so that people cannot feelthe other’s feelings. Dharmakīrti also disagrees with this opinion because it is impossible that there are two different cognitions to the one object of cognition. He asserts that regardless of the coordination of the feelings and the personal ātman, there must be the same result: Other people cannot feel the same pleasure etc. thatbelongs to a person.To conclude, Dharmakīrti says another means of cognition to be aware of pleasure etc. is not necessary; that is, cognition itself grasps all psychological phenomenon, a kind of knowledge as the object of cognition.On the other hand, in Mīmāṃsā’s epistemology, the function of manas is a key word in the negation of self-awareness and introduction of the other means of cognition theory. Dharmakīrti, however, does not discuss the manas in the part of the cognition to pleasure etc. I infer it is related to Dharmakīrti limits on mānasapratyakṣaas the pratyakṣa to the cognition of being outside and svasaṃvedana as the pratyakṣa for the cognition of psychological phenomena.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Methods: The keratometry (K), axial length (AXL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured using ultrasound biometry (USB) combined with auto-keratometry (Auto-K), parital coherence interferometry (PCI; IOL master？？) and dual Scheimpflug analyzer (DSA; Galilei？？) in 39 eyes of 39 patients. Predicted refraction was calculated using Auto-K, mean K of PCI, and simK and total corneal power (TCP) of DSA in the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK-T) formula. The SRK-II, SRK-T, Holladay II, Haigis, and Hoffer-Q formula were used to calculate predicted refraction with the simK of DSA and AXL of USB. Manifest refraction, mean numerical error (MNE) and mean absolute error were evaluated 1, 3 and 6 months after cataract surgery. Results: TCP of DSA was lower compared with other keratometric values (p 〈 0.05). The MNE was not different among Auto-K, mean K and simK. The MNE using TCP was larger compared with Auto-K, mean K and simK at 1 month after surgery (p 〈 0.05). There was a difference in MNE between simK and TCP of DSA at 6 months after surgery (p 〈 0.05). The MNE of SRK-T formula was the smallest in the intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation using the simK of DSA. Conclusions: We suggest using IOL power calculations with simK of DSA and SRK-T formula rather than TCP of DSA in cataract patients with normal corneas.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Group 1 was younger than 10 years, group 2 was older than 10 years and younger than 18 years, and group 3 was older than 18 years. Subjects were tested using the Lenstar LS900®, KR-8100®, and Medmont E300®. Comparisons were made for steep K, flat K, mean K, and astigmatism among three groups. Agreement among the 3 devices was examined using the Bland-Altman method. Results: The keratometry measured by Medmont E300® was highest, followed by that of Lenstar LS900® and KR-8100® in all 3 groups. Almost all keratometry was significantly different among the 3 devices except for the flat K measured by LS900® and KR-8100® in all 3 groups and flat K measured by KR-8100® and Medmont E300® in Group 3 (p 〈 0.05).

The agreement between KR-8100® and Medmont E300® was worse than that between the other two pairs in Groups 1 and 3, while the agreement between Lenstar LS900® and Medmont E300® was worse in Group 2. Conclusions: There were significant differences in keratometry among the 3 devices in all 3 groups. In children, Medmont E300® showed relatively less agreement compared with the other two devices. In adults, however, the agreement between 2 devices showed variable results. Consideration of the keratometry measurement from Lenstar LS900®, KR-8100®, and Medmont E300® might be helpful to estimate accurate corneal keratometry in children.

The early stage of Yi’s literature when is from 1928 to 1932 has three different themes; urbanism, socialism, exoticism. Among these three concepts, this essay dealt with urbanism and socialism which contradict each other and tried to figure out what this ambivalence mean.Ryūtanji is a Japanese writer who shares same era and similar literary style with Yi. Both of Yi and Ryūtanji’s early works contain bourgeois modern culture and proletarian context at the same time. This singularity of their literature has been regarded as a contradiction or immaturity. However, when it comes to Shōwa period, it is true that modernist art and socialist art contradicted each other, but they had common ground in their ideological foundation. Artists of Shōwa competed for hegemony sharing perception and subject matter, and this ‘nonsense’ of sharing and coexistence is also applied to works of Ryūtanji and Yi. Therefore, the ambivalence of Ryūtanji and Yi’s works should be understood as a uniqueness reflecting the trend of the time. Furthermore, it was revealed that Yi’s early works are closely related to Japanese Shōwa literature and his literature has a sharp sense of the time.As already known, Yi Hyosŏk kept artistic identity and originality with solid main ideas of his literary world which are aestheticism and cosmopolitanism. Besides, at the same time, his sense of trend created splendid scenes in his stories. This could be counted as a value and significance of Yi Hyosŏk’s literature.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
Centrality dependence of subthresholdϕmeson production in Ni + Ni collisions at1.9AGeV,2016,,,"<P>We analyzed the phi meson production in central Ni + Ni collisions at a beam kinetic energy of 1.93A GeV with the FOPI spectrometer and found a production probability per event of [8.6 +/- 1.6(stat) +/- 1.5(syst)] x 10(-4). This new data point allows us for the first time to inspect the centrality dependence of subthreshold phi meson production in heavy-ion collisions. The rise of phi meson multiplicity per event with mean number of participants can be parametrized by a power function with exponent alpha = 1.8 +/- 0.6. The ratio of phi to K- production yields seems not to depend, within the experimental uncertainties, on the collision centrality, and the average of measured values was found to be 0.36 +/- 0.05.</P>",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

That is, this study is not only a diachronic and synchronic renarration of the long-established ambiguity and hegemony between Korea, Asia, Japan, and the West but also an analysis of the uniqueness and meaning of the ambivalence of hallyu in the dynamics of global and local.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

For this current study, 57 listed companies that revaluated their assets in 2009 were selected and the indices such as return on equity(ROE), return on asset(ROA) and Debt-Equity ratio in 2009 were compared with those after 2009.  It has been observed from empirical study that the indices improved due to the asset revaluation. However, these improvements are not further improved nor maintained at the same level as time elapsed after the asset revaluation. Furthermore, these indices were regressed to the level prior to the asset revaluation. This result indicates that the asset revaluation from fair-valuation option, far from enhancing the quality of accounting information, are exploited as opportunism.  This study suggests that the asset revaluation did not serve the intended improvements expected from the asset revaluation based on K-IFRS and provides evidence that it further degrades the quality of accounting information due to management abuse of the revaluation. Thus the discretion is needed when the fair value accounting system is introduced. Also, another significant finding of the current study is that the improvement as a result of the revaluation is only temporary illusions and the discretion is needed when translating the meaning of the revaluation.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Estimation of Suitable Methodology for Determining Weibull Parameters for the Vortex Shedding Analysis of Synovial Fluid,2016,"['Weibull distribution', 'vortex shedding', 'synovial fluid', 'least square estimation method', 'maximum likelihood estimator', 'method of moment']",,"Weibull distribution with two parameters, shape (k) and scale (s) parameters are used to model the fatigue failure analysis due to periodic vortex shedding of the synovial fluid in knee joints. In order to determine the later parameter, a suitable statistical model is required for velocity distribution of synovial fluid flow. Hence, wide applicability of Weibull distribution in life testing and reliability analysis can be applied to describe the probability distribution of synovial fluid flow velocity. In this work, comparisons of three most widely used methods for estimating Weibull parameters are carried out; i.e. the least square estimation method (LSEM), maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the method of moment (MOM), to study fatigue failure of bone joint due to periodic vortex shedding of synovial fluid. The performances of these methods are compared through the analysis of computer generated synovial fluidflow velocity distribution in the physiological range. Significant values for the (k) and (s) parameters are obtained by comparing these methods. The criterions such as root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination ($R^2$), maximum error between the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) or Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and the chi square tests are used for the comparison of the suitability of these methods. The results show that maximum likelihood method performs well for most of the cases studied and hence recommended.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Our ZF-μSR spectra of CeRu2Ga2B with a Curie temperature at TC = 16.3 K show a well-defined muon procession at temperatures below TC. The extracted critical exponent of  = 0.533 is close to the mean-field value of  = 0.5. On the other hand, the isomorphic CeRu2Al2B exhibits an intriguing evolution of the ZF-μSR spectrum through a spin density wave/ferromagnetic transition at TC = 12.8 K with a subsequent magnetic anomaly at T = 6 K. Strikingly, the muon frequency decreases upon cooling to temperatures below TC and can be no longer resolved at temperatures below T. At the same time, the muon relaxation rate increases continuously at temperatures below TC. These give an indication of the development of an inhomogeneous and dynamic ferromagnetic state. The contrasting ferromagnetism between CeRu2Ga2B and CeRu2Al2B evidences that a certain type of intrinsic/extrinsic perturbation, for example, exchange frustration and defects/impurities, can exert a drastic impact on the local magnetic properties in a family of 4f-localized magnetic materials with frustration.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

If we mix two fuels with variable fractions, combustion characteristics will be represented with dependence on the fraction. We first investigated the change of combustion characteristics and combustion ranges by dimethyl ether (DME)/methanol fraction, IVC temperature and IVC pressure.By increasing methanol fraction, Heat release rate (HRR) showed higher rate than the case containing less methanol after 1250 K. However, it didn't mean that Accumulated heat release (AHR) was also higher than the cases which contained less methanol. AHR of D90/M10 was the first case which surpassed AHR of D100 at about 1808K, and D80/M20 surpassed D100 at about 2318K. The result was caused by change of reaction mechanism and the change was remarkably shown in the Thermal ignition preparation (TIP) range and the Thermal ignition (TI) range. Above all, strengthened H 2 O 2 Loop reactions affected heat production to increase in TIP range, and also one of the loop reactions, CH 2 O + OH = HCO + H 2 O, quickly produced formyl radical with increase of net reaction rate by methanol.Those results naturally led to higher reaction rates of HCO-CO-CO 2 oxidation with higher heat production. As a result, D50/M50 case showed the highest maximum Pressure rise rate (PRR). Furthermore, dispersion rate of PRR was increased by increasing methanol fraction in the range which was from back end of TIP to forepart of TI range.

In the course of metabolite analysis from tyrosinase inhibitory methanol extract (80% inhibition at 20 mu g/ml) of Campylotropis hirtella, we isolated fourteen phenolic compounds, among which neorauflavane 3 emerged as a lead structure for tyrosinase inhibition. Neorauflavane 3 inhibited tyrosinase monophenolase activity with an IC50 of 30 nM. Thus this compound is 400-fold more active than kojic acid. It also inhibited diphenolase (IC50 = 500 nM), significantly. Another potent inhibitor 1 (IC50 = 2.9 mu M) was found to be the most abundant metabolite in C. hirtella. In kinetic studies, compounds 3 showed competitive inhibitory behavior against both monophenolase and diphenolase. It manifested simple reversible slow-binding inhibition against monophenolase with the following kinetic parameters: K-i(app) = 1.48 nM, k(3) = 0.0033 nM (1) min (1) and k(4) = 0.0049 min (1).

Lack of reserve has been suggested as a possible mechanism underlying increased risk for dementia in this population. We believe that the same mechanism, or reserve, would be related to normal cognitive aging. This study was conducted to examine whether illiteracy moderated the patten of age-related cognitive change and was related to increased risk for cognitive decline in follow-up tests in normal Korean elderly subjects. Standardized Regression Based(SRB) Model was utilized to detect cognitive decliner controlling regression to mean, practice effect and measurement error. The main results were as follows. First, the illiterate performed poorly on all area of cognitive function including attention, initiation/perseveration, construction, conceptualization and memory than the literate. Second, age-related cognitive change was faster in the illiterate than the literate in all cognitive areas in cross-sectional analysis. Third, the rate of cognitive decliner was about five times higher in the illiterate than the literate group, and the odds ratio of the illiterate was 3.62. These results suggested that lack of reserve, measured by literacy, may have negative influence on normal cognitive aging as well as dementia.

The value of culture is estimated to be getting higher every year and the overall reputation of Korean culture including K-Drama, K-pop, K-fashion is increasing. The cultural component in the design is also becoming important. Accordingly, a development of product design reinterpreted in a modern way from the traditional cultural ingredient would contribute to the industrialization of Korean culture. The thesis contains the design to make scarves and neckties by applying traditional Jogakbo which was a typical method in Joseon Dynasty. The Jogakbo is a representative Korean culture and has a tremendous potential for expression. It has been used already by Karl Lagerfeld in Chanel Cruise Collection in 2015-16. The artwork mainly includes women s normal square shape scarf for middle aged women, twilly scarf for young customers and neckties for men. These artworks can be used not only as each piece but also a combination set of scarf and necktie. After analyzing the detailed structure of traditional Jogakbo, 3 main components were selected and applied to the design. All artworks were produced with digital printing methods which can express effectively various colors and textures and also are appropriate for small-quantity production. Conversion of hand crafts to digital printing for custom production increases the competitiveness as a cultural product. Fashion products reflecting the traditional culture are important because of the culture’s meaning and value. But a unique and differentiated design by reinterpreting the traditional value in modern way would add to its value more.

藤原定家의 達磨歌에 관한 고찰,2016,"['達磨歌', '本歌取', '余情', '妖艶', '有心', 'darumauta', 'honkadori', 'yozyo', 'yoen', 'ushin']",,"The purpose of this paper is to define Darumauta(Dharma Poetry;達磨歌). Darumauta means that the conservative poetical circles compared the progressive poetry style of Mikohidari Family(御子左家) to a newly-risen religion, Dhrma Order of Buddhism which was harshly criticized. It means a nonsense poem a pejorative term for Zen. It seems that this term was coined in connection with the Zen kōan’s ‘critical phrases’ that seemed like unintelligible riddles to ordinary people and other Buddhist schools. This term was used by conservative waka poets to refer to the innovative style of Fujiwara no Teika. Nevertheless, at that time the conservative poetical circles didn’t understand about Yozyo(余情) and Yoen(妖艶) which compiled in part of aesthetic sense by Teika. So they disparaged Teika’s new thoughts as Darumauta. However Darumauta broke away from the traditional style that kept old way of thinking. Teika’s Darumauta is a device of zeitgeist and made stereotyped phrases express discourse of language. Therefore, the essence of Darumauta is a conversion of poetic language and idea which aims for Ushin(有心). it works a new poetic turn of mind in the whole progress of the second Yozyou(余情) and Yoen(妖艶).",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Intangible asset has a high level of audit risk compared to other asset because intangible asset is invisible and satisfy strict definitions to be recognized in the financial statement.The results of this study are as follow. Intangible asset increases audit hour and audit fee compared to PPE. This results means that auditor increases audit risk of intangible asset because of invisibility of intangible asset and judging of identifiability. Furthermore, intangible asset is more related to audit effort after the adoption of K-IFRS. It is because K-IFRS requires the different accounting treatment of intangible asset such as no depreciation but testing impairment of goodwill while K-GAAP requires depreciation under 20 years. Finally, big accounting firm who has a more interest in reputation effect than local accounting firm put more effort in auditing intangible asset.This study finds the auditor’s respond to the audit risk by employing intangible asset. This results contributes that audit risk related to intangible asset is offset by auditor’s effort that auditor’s due care increases the reliability of the financial statement.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

It was named “first nature” and assessed as a living space unable to provide adequate living conditions for people. This attitude created a pre-requisite for forming a radical technocratic stand with a focal demand to create a “second nature”,that is the nature that would be constructed by people by means of science and technology. Based on that stand, there emerged a number of projects, utopian in character, seeking to change man’s natural living environment. Their authors perceived the structure of the earth and outer space as a simple mechanical arrangement thatcould be improved by man.Writers of various ideological and artistic platforms took part in the discussion on improvement of people’s natural living environment. Leaders of the discussion were writers of the proletarian and later industrial subjects (in particular, M. Gorky, A.Platonov, proletarian poets) and representatives of “scientific poetry”. Even peasant writers sympathized with the idea of radical change of nature.Projects on the rebuild of nature were proposed in works of fiction, scientific treatise and publicist essays. A desire to overcome hunger, poverty, inconveniencies of landscape and climate was the driving motivation for authors of such projects.

He borrows a considerable number of terms from other science without entering into a discussion about their precise meanings, thus leaving us to formulate the concepts behind these terms. Wordclass categories are usually defined by enumeration. Other grammatical categories may be defined on purely formal grounds, or again by enumeration.  Patan͂jali’s Mahābhāṣya on P 1.3.1 “bhūvadayo dhātavaḥ” discusses definitional, practical, and philosophical issues raised by the notion of a verbal root (dhātu). Already before Patanjali, Kātyāyana’s Vārttikas indicate that this rule and the notion of a verbal root had become a subject of debates and disputes, and one sees reflections of some of these debates also in Yāska’s Nirukta. This study presents a detailed account of these early debates and disputes, mostly as seen in Patan͂jali’s Mahābhāṣya, but also as seen in Bhartṛhari’s and Kaiyaṭa’s work.  Among the important topics covered in this study are the various alternative definitions proposed for the notion of a verbal root, namely a list-based definition as seen in P. 1.3.1, a kriyā-based definition, and a bhāva-based definition. If a root is defined as a signifier of kriyā, then how does one deal with roots like √bhū and √as, that seem to denote a state? If a root is defined as a signifier of bhāva, then how does one deal with roots like √kṛ that denote a kriyā? Patan͂jali argues that even the root √as denotes a kriyā. For that reason Patan͂jali introduces the notion of bhāva “becoming” recited in the Nirukta. that embraces genesis, existence, alteration, growth, decay, and destruction. However, he rewrites bhāva vs. sattva into kriyā vs. dravya, because the meaning of bhāva of the time has been changed from ‘becoming’ to ‘being.’ This strategy resulted in the unintended consequences, that is, the metaphysical turning point from the becoming-dominant to the being-dominant.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Kirchlichkeit is the religious normativity of european culture. This concept is a event of intertextual understanding of religious and historical theology by semler, schleiermacher und of church dogmatics by k. barth. With this concept explains he, that his social ethics comes from hermeneutical theology and refers to the hermeneutical dogmatics and ethics. He tries to explain practical “kirchlichkeit”. What is practical “kirchlichkeit”? First, he regards “Kirchlichkeit” as identity. Man expresses with freedom identity and develops faith community. “Setting in Life” of christian faith is a historical and modern kontext, where church and theology the whole life of christian form. Rendtorff regards interpretation of “Setting in Life” of religious life the task of theology. Second, he defines “Kirchlichkeit” as individuality of christian faith in the european religious history and european culture. Theology is hermeneutics as localization in relation to churches dogmatics by karl barth. Here is church a room, where Gott appears as trinity. The subject of church is not mensch, but god. If god appears in the church, understands christian god as the basis of identity of christian faith. Church is a dogmatic form of freedom in society. Third is “Kirchlichkeit” the basis of social ethics. Because social ethics makes religious society with various forms to social body. It is a matter of political theology. Trutz Rendtorff emphasizes living together, mutual cognition, compromise, dissent care in public life, in order to reach consensus. Rendtorff emphasizes the interpretation of religious text and traditions and dialogue with other religions. This is a meaning of social ethics as perform of life. Finally has social ethics the formation of identity and Kirchlichkeit as task of korean theology.

It was named “first nature” and assessed as a living space unable to provide adequate living conditions for people. This attitude created a pre-requisite for forming a radical technocratic stand with a focal demand to create a “second nature”, that is the nature that would be constructed by people by means of science and technology. Based on that stand, there emerged a number of projects, utopian in character, seeking to change man’s natural living environment. Their authors perceived the structure of the earth and outer space as a simple mechanical arrangement that could be improved by man.Writers of various ideological and artistic platforms took part in the discussion on improvement of people’s natural living environment. Leaders of the discussion were writers of the proletarian and later industrial subjects (in particular, M. Gorky, A. Platonov, proletarian poets) and representatives of “scientific poetry”. Even peasant writers sympathized with the idea of radical change of nature.Projects on the rebuild of nature were proposed in works of fiction, scientific treatise and publicist essays.

The findings were summarized as follows: For the nutritional knowledge level, health-oriented group showed the highest mean score, whereas the lowest score was detected in the convenience-oriented group. The convenienceoriented group showed higher preferences for fish, meat, eggs, fruits, milk/dairy products, seaweed, grains, etc. among natural food than the other groups. Meanwhile, the rational and diversity-oriented group preferred legumes, and green vegetables, whereas the health-oriented group showed preferences for other vegetables. However, the convenience-oriented group reported more preferences for breads, noodles, pancakes, fried/stir-fried food, and processed food such as sausage, ham, and fast food, This study found that nutritional knowledge level and food preferences were significantly different according to food-related lifestyles of married women living in Seoul and Gyonggie areas. Thus, it is suggested that nutritional education targeting married women needs to be carefully designed by considering their food-related lifestyle.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Is there a stratospheric radiative feedback in global warming simulations?,2016,,,"<P>The radiative impacts of the stratosphere in global warming simulations are investigated using abrupt CO2 quadrupling experiments of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), with a focus on stratospheric temperature and water vapor. It is found that the stratospheric temperature change has a robust bullhorn-like zonal-mean pattern due to a strengthening of the stratospheric overturning circulation. This temperature change modifies the zonal mean top-of-the-atmosphere energy balance, but the compensation of the regional effects leads to an insignificant global-mean radiative feedback (-0.02 +/- 0.04 W m(-2) K-1). The stratospheric water vapor concentration generally increases, which leads to a weak positive global-mean radiative feedback (0.02 +/- 0.01 W m(-2) K-1). The stratospheric moistening is related to mixing of elevated upper-tropospheric humidity, and, to a lesser extent, to change in tropical tropopause temperature. Our results indicate that the strength of the stratospheric water vapor feedback is noticeably larger in high-top models than in low-top ones. The results here indicate that although its radiative impact as a forcing adjustment is significant, the stratosphere makes a minor contribution to the overall climate feedback in CMIP5 models.</P>",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

METHODS: Seventy-eight subjects (14 men, 64 women) with KOA, between the ages of 41 and 83 years (mean age, 61.29 years), were included. All the subjects diagnosed with KOA were scored for severity of radiographic KOA according to the Kellgren-Lawrence (K/L) grade, visual analogue scale (VAS), knee joint range of motion (ROM), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), maximum muscle power (MMP), and sit-to-stand (STS) and one-leg standing (OLS) tests. Associations among the K/L grade, diagnosis, pain, and function were examined by correlation analysis. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the K/L grade, and the VAS, STS test time, and WOMAC scores (p>.05). There were no significant differences between the K/L grade, bilateral ROM, MMP, and left OLS test time (p>.05). However, there was a significant difference between the K/L grade and right OLS test time (p<.05). The K/L grade was negatively correlated with the left OLS test time(r=-.24, p<.05) and with the right OLS test time (r=-.307, p<.01).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility and validity of the Korean version of the FRAIL (K-FRAIL) scale. Methods: Questionnaire items were translated and administered to 103 patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. In this cross-sectional study, the K-FRAIL scale was compared with the domains and the multidimensional frailty index of the comprehensive geriatric assessment. We also assessed the time required to complete the scale. Results: The participants’ mean age was 76.8 years (standard deviation [SD], 6.1), and 55 (53.4%) were males. The mean overall frailty index was 0.19 (SD, 0.17). For K-FRAIL-robust, prefrail, and frail patients, the mean frailty indices were 0.09, 0.18, and 0.34, respectively (p for trend < 0.001). A higher degree of impairment in the K-FRAIL scale was associated with worse nutritional status, poor physical performance, functional dependence, and polypharmacy. The number of items with impairment in the K-FRAIL scale was positively associated with the frailty index (B = 3.73, p < 0.001). The K-FRAIL scale could differentiate vulnerability from robustness with a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.33. Of all patients, 75 (72.8%) completed the K-FRAIL scale within < 3 minutes. Conclusions: The K-FRAIL scale is correlated with the frailty index and is a simple tool to screen for frailty in a clinical setting.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Influence of Pb Doping on the Magnetocaloric Effect and Critical Behavior of (La0.9Dy0.1)0.8Pb0.2MnO3,2016,,,"<P>We used the modified Arrott plot method to analyze the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization, M(H), for a perovskite-type manganite (La0.9Dy0.1)(0.8)Pb0.2MnO3, and determined the critical parameter values T (C) = 248.4 K, beta = 0.484 +/- A 0.002, gamma = 0.961 +/- A 0.012, and delta = 2.90 +/- A 0.01. With these exponent values, the M(H) data around T (C) fall on two universal branches of a scaling function M(H,epsilon) = |epsilon| (beta) f (+/-)(H/|epsilon| (beta + gamma) ), where epsilon = (T - T (C))/T (C) is the reduced temperature, f (+) for T > T (C) and f (-) for T < T (C). Comparing with theoretical models, the exponent values obtained in our work are quite close to those expected from mean-field theory (with beta = 0.5, gamma = 1, and delta = 3). This reveals nearly long-range ferromagnetic order existing in (La0.9Dy0.1)(0.8) Pb0.2MnO3. From the M(H) data, we also found that, around the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase-transition temperature (T (C)), the magnetic entropy change reaches a maximum value (|delta S (max)|) of about 1.1 J kg(-1) K-1 for H = 10 kOe, corresponding to relative cooling power (RCP) of 50 J/kg.

For the study, issue leadership was selected as the verification subject for its field-centric and result driven tendencies and SMEs as research subjects, as they are more easily influenced by CEO leadership.  In order to verify the research hypothesis, 220 SMEs, all customers of K bank, were selected and conducted surveys on the CEO and 3 employees for each of them. Total of 175 SMEs responded, and the responses were then screened for completeness and validity. As a result, 153 SMEs qualified as subjects for further analysis. The survey was structured to prevent common method bias meaning that overlap in addressing independent variable, moderating variable and dependent variable within the survey was not allowed between participants. In short, dependent variable (subjective financial performance) were addressed by the CEO, independent variable (CEO issue leadership) and moderating variable (CEO competency) by participating employees.  In conclusion, the positive corelation between CEO issue leadership and corporate performance and the role of CEO competency as the moderating facto were verified for the first time (〈Table 1〉).  Practical and theoretical implications derived from this research are as follows. Firstly, effect of the CEO leadership on subjective corporate performance was verified, and the fact that his/her issue leadership was required for SMEs to enhance its performance. Secondly, the relationship between the CEO issue leadership and corporate performance was strengthened upon employees recognizing the his/her competency.

영국의 핀테크산업 규제에 관한 법적 고찰 - 인터넷전문은행과 P2P거래를 중심으로 -,2016,"['FinTech start-ups', 'FinTech industry', 'digital-only bank', 'P2P lending', 'internet-only bank', 'FinTech', '핀테크', '인터넷전문은행', 'P2P대출', '핀테크 창업기업', '핀테크 산업']","핀테크(Fintech)는 금융(Finance)와 기술(Technology)을 조합하여 만든 조어라고 할 수 있는데, 핀테크 산업이란 일반적으로 금융서비스를 제공하기 위한 소프트웨어의 활용에 기초한 사업의 분야라고 할 수 있다. 달리 표현하면, 금융시스템을 보다 효율적으로 만들기 위한 기술(technology)을 사용하는 회사로 구성된 산업이라고 할 수 있다.핀테크 산업은 송금, 결제, 금융데이터분석, 크라우드펀딩, P2P대출(Peer-to-peer Lending), 디지털 화폐, 사이버 보안, 자산관리, 신용평가 등을 포괄한다고 할 수 있다. 그리고 이러한 핀테크 산업을 선도하는 회사는 창업기업(startups)인 경우가 일반적이다.핀테크 산업에 대한 글로벌 투자 규모는 2008년 약 9억 달러에서 2013년 약 40억 달러로 세 배 이상 증가하였다. 더욱이 해가 갈수록 핀테크 산업에 대한 투자는 급증하고 있는 추세에 있다.핀테크 산업에 대한 투자를 선도하고 있는 대표적인 국가가 영국이라고 할 수 있는데, 영국 정부는 체계적인 핀테크 산업 육성정책을 수립하여 추진해 오고 있다. 런던에 소재하고 있는 유명한 핀테크 회사로는 FundingCircle, Nutmeg, TransferWise가 있는데, FundingCircle은 P2P대출업무, TransferWise는 국제송금업무, Nutmeg는 자산관리업무에 특화되어 있다.우리나라의 경우에도 최근 언론을 통해 핀테크 산업이 집중적인 조명을 받고 있을 뿐만 아니라 핀테크 산업이 우리의 일상생활에까지 큰 영향을 주고 있다. 예를 들면, 삼성페이, 카카오페이, 페이나우 등과 같이 휴대폰을 통해 소액결제가 이루어지는 방송광고가 눈에 띄게 증가하고 있다. 8퍼센트, 머니옥션 등과 같은 P2P 대출업체도 운영되고 있으며, 카카오 뱅크, 케이뱅크와 같은 인터넷전문은행이 설립되어 그 서비스 개시를 목전에 두고 있다.첫째, 영국의 인터넷전문은행은 기본적으로 기존 은행제도의 파괴적 혁신과 금융소비자의 편익 제고라는 관점에서 도입되어 운영되고 있다고 평가할 수 있다. 이러한 흐름을 고려하면 규제완화와 금융혁신의 관점에서 인터넷전문은행의 도입을 적극적으로 검토할 필요성이 있다고 생각된다. 다만 법적 논란을 잠재우기 위해서라도 은행법의 개정을 통해 인터넷전문은행을 도입하는 것이 바람직하다고 생각된다. 이와 함께 금융소비자보호방안이 마련되어야 한다. 인터넷전문은행은 향후 밀레니엄세대 내지 모바일세대의 은행으로 발전할 가능성이 높다고 본다.둘째, P2P대출의 경우 영국은 대부업법과 자본시장법의 양자의 적용을 통해 규제를 하고 있는 것처럼 보인다. P2P대출 분야 역시 핀테크 창업기업의 주요 활동무대라고 할 수 있다. 금융혁신을 고려하면 P2P대출의 활성화를 위한 규제완화입법이 필요하다고 생각된다. 이를 위한 방안으로는 자본시장법 개정 방안과 새로운 입법 방안을 검토할 수 있다고 본다.","Today financial services are largely provided through some form of technology. This technology makes financial services much more efficient and convenient. Financial services technology can, therefore, facilitate transactions without regard to the complex regulatory structure governing financial services. FinTech simply means financial technology. In addition, FinTech has already made huge inroads into many aspects of our daily lives.The birth and rise of FinTech is deeply rooted in the financial crisis. Since the financial crisis of 2008, FinTech has greatly increased and developed. The FinTech industry includes P2P(peer-to-peer) lending, a digital-only bank, big data, payments, personal finance, retail investment, remittance, equity financing and so on. Furthermore, start-ups have played an important role in the FinTech industry. FinTech start-ups have offered new and fresh services at lower costs through well-designated platforms or mobile apps. Specifically, London becomes a FinTech hub in the world and there are lots of FinTech start-ups in UK.Recently, the Korean government has tried to assist and encourage the FinTech industry through legislation. Many FinTech start-ups have already operated in Korea. For example, P2P lending platforms like 8percent and Moneyaution have operated, but legislation for P2P lending business has been unclear and insufficient. In addition, internet-only banks like Kakao-bank and K-Bank have started, but complicated legal arguments have still continued under the Banking Act.In this connection, this paper explores regulation of the FinTech industry in UK. First, the FinTech industry in UK is examined specifically in respect of P2P lending and a digital-only bank. Second, regulation of P2P lending and a digital-only bank is deeply analyzed in UK.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
Bayesian case influence analysis for GARCH models based on Kullback–Leibler divergence,2016,"['Bayesian case influence', 'GARCH models', 'Kullback–Leibler divergence']",,"Influence analysis has become an important tool for statistical analysis. This paper is concerned with Bayesian case influence analysis for generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model. Case influence analysis is developed for both the joint and marginal posterior distributions based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence (K–L divergence).A simplified expression is presented for computing the K–L divergence between the full data posterior distribution and the case-deleted posterior distributions. The related computations can be done numerically by Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples from posterior distribution with full data. Some simulation studies are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed methods and show the relations between case-deletion model (CDM) and mean-shift outlier model (MSOM) for the GARCH models. Meanwhile, the methods are also illustrated by a real data.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

During four months, the author observed and interviewed to students working as a supplementary teacher at the K middle school and found three unique collective mentalities as a result. The first thing was named as ‘master mentality’ which implied that it was man who master the playground at the school.Constructing based on meritocracy, this mentality was legitimated by the collective consensus which was about persons who have capabilities on physical activity should occupy the place. The second thing was ‘norm mentality’ which was about there are somethings made persons suitable for the playground. For male students, these characteristics were listed as ability to play the soccer and to sweat much without any consideration about next class. In contrast, for female students these norms are mostly characterized with some avoidance from competition, sunshine, and others’ evaluative gaze. Last thing was drawn as ‘tolerance mentality’ which means that male students as a master of the playground had to have tolerant mindset to let the girls play on the ground. This mentality also connoted that it is definitely a man who is able to give a permission to girls to use the playground, because the man is a master of the playground.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

During 12 year’s monitoring, mean soil pH was increased by 0.7 and 0.8 pH unit from pH 5.7 in upland and orchard, respectively, 0.5 pH unit from pH 6.5 in plastic film house. About 50% of all the field samples occupied within the recommended pH range (pH 6-7). Although soil organic matter (SOM) was gradually increased by about 10 g ㎏<SUP>-1</SUP> for 12 years, 40% of orchard, 49% of plastic film house, and 77% of upland soil samples were still below the 3% SOM. The mean concentration of available phosphate for 12 years in upland, orchard, and plastic film house were 530, 600, and 760 mg ㎏<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. The relative frequencies exceeding the recommended available phosphate range (300-550 ㎎ ㎏<SUP>-1</SUP>) were 43%, 53%, and 66% at upland, orchard, and plastic film house soils, respectively. NH₄OAc exchangeable K⁺ of upland, orchard, and plastic film house in the last soil test were 0.8, 0.9, and 1.6 cmolc ㎏<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. The relative frequencies above the recommended K level were 56% and 70% of orchard and plastic film house soil samples, respectively. The levels of crop nutrients except exchangeable Ca and Mg in upland soil were tended to increase gradually in the three fields. Exchangeable Mg, EC, available phosphate, organic matter and soil pH could be used as principle components to differentiate the chemical properties of three land fields. This analysis revealed that the soil fertility was affected by cropping method and field management, although additional research is needed to assess the importance of management on soil chemical properties and many fields indicate an opportunity for improvement in fertilizer management.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

In MS, Asaṅga simply quotes the cittamātra passage and does not offer any explanation. On the contrary, In Viṃś, Vasubandhu the kośakāra adds a short but exquisite commentary.After Viṃś, the cittamātra passage with Vasubandhu’s commentary is quoted until the time of Ratnākaraśānti. It is quoted as a typical āgama to prove the theory of ‘Mind-only’.In Viṃś, Vasubandhu the kośakāra considers “citta” and “vijñapti” as synonyms and interprets the meaning of “mātra” as a negation of external objects. Therefore, he interprets “cittamātra” as “vijñaptimātra”.On the other hand, Mādhyamikas, such as Bhāviveka, criticizes Yogācāras for misunderstanding the cittamātra passage. Mādhyamikas interprets the passage as not a negation of external objects but as a negation of kārtṛ and bhoktṛ viz. the ātman.Yogācāras, however, does not acknowledge their criticism. Not only Dharmapāla and Sthiramati, who would have known of Bhāviveka’s criticism, but also Asvabhāva and Vinītadeva, who commented on the cittamātra passage in the MS and Viṃś respectively, just paraphrased Vasubandhu’s explanation and didn’t respond to Bhāviveka’s criticism.The same is true of Ratnātnākaraśānti.Lastly, I examined the original meaning of the cittamātra passage in the DśBh and Vasubandhu’s commentary on it (十地經論), and it is confirmed that the original meaning of the cittamātra passage is a negation of kārtṛ and the bhoktṛ viz. the ātman. Vasubandhu’s commentary on the DśBh, though unobvious, seems to interpret the cittamātra passage as a negation of ātman. Therefore, it is certain that the Yogācāras’ interpretation of cittamātra passage is different from its original meaning.This could allude that the author of the commentary of DśBh (十地經論) and the author of Viṃś might be different.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Subjects were 20 ADHD boys and girls of 4th and 5th grade, and the same number of general children. Intelligence was measured by K-WISC-Ⅲ, and each of three components of working memory(central executive, phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad) was measured by two subtests. The data were analysed with t-test, ANCOVA, and Pearson correlation coefficients. The results showed the difference between the two groups only in the central executive of working memory, not in the phonological loop or visuospatial sketchpad. This implies that the impairments of ADHD children are not in the perception of information but in the storage, regulation, and processing of information. The difference in the capacity of central executive between the two groups disappeared when the effects of intelligence was mediated statistically in the ANCOVA analysis. It means that the intelligence and working memory may share some common cognitive processes. The analysis of correlation coefficients revealed that the central executive and the memory of static matrices had high correlations with intelligence both in the ADHD and the whole group. This made it possible to presume that the ADHD children may rely heavily on the visual information in their cognitive processes in spite of their inefficiency of visual information processing.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The confirmative factor analysis, test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity were assessed. The study group consisted of 71 males (59.7%) and 48 females (40.3%). Their mean age was 42.15 years (SD = 12.2).The K-CAINS was confirmed to be divided into two subscales of 9 items related to “motivation/pleasure” and 4 items related to “expression” in concordance with the original version of the CAINS. The results showed that the K-CAINS had a good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.84-0.94), test-retest reliability (r = 0.90, P < 0.001). Convergent validity was proven by demonstrating a significant correlation with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative subscale, and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Discriminant validity was proven by the lack of a significant correlation with the PANSS positive subscale, the Korean version of the Beck depression inventory (BDI), the Korean version of the Calgary depression scale for schizophrenia (K-CDSS), and the Modified Simpson Angus scale (MSAS).

P-wave durations were obtained using surface electrocardiography and sizes of the left atrium were determined using echocardiography. Cardiac inward rectifier K+ currents (Ik1), Na+ currents (INa), and action potentials were recorded from isolated left atrial myocytes using patch clamp techniques. Left atrial tissue specimens were analyzed for total connexin-40 (Cx40) and connexin-43 (Cx43) expression levels on western-blots. Specimens were also analyzed for Cx40 and Cx43 distribution and interstitial fibrosis by immunofluorescent and Masson trichrome staining, respectively. The mean P-wave duration was longer in T2DM rats than in controls; however, the mean left atrial sizes of each group of rats were similar. The densities of Ik1 and INa were unchanged in T2DM rats compared to controls. The action potential duration was longer in T2DM rats, but there was no significant difference in resting membrane potential or action potential amplitude compared to controls. The expression level of Cx40 protein was significantly lower, but Cx43 was unaltered in T2DM rats. However, immunofluorescent labeling of Cx43 showed a significantly enhanced lateralization. Staining showed interstitial fibrosis was greater in T2DM atrial tissue.Prolonged P-wave duration is not dependent on the left atrial size in rats with T2DM.Dysregulation of Cx40 and Cx43 protein expression, as well as fibrosis, might partly account for the prolongation of P-wave duration in T2DM.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The main results of this study are like below. First, the sense of beauty is the statistical rate showing that Chinese women start having it later than Korean women, which means that China is still influenced by Korea. Second, regarding the perception of herbal cosmetics, Korean women focus on the differentiation of ingredients while Chinese women focus on the safety for skin. Third, Chinese women show greater favorable feelings toward herbal cosmetics than Korean women while they are also willing to invest more money in the consumption of herbal cosmetics. Due to the influence of the recent K-wave, there have been active researches on herbal cosmetics using herbal ingredients as raw materials. However, there are not many comparative researches on differences in the concrete perception of herbal cosmetics, targeting Korean and Chinese women. Thus, this study is expected to contribute to active research activities in the future, and also to provide basic data such as education related to herbal cosmetics and marketing strategies in case when Korean herbal cosmetics enter the Chinese market.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Influence of Ti Doping on the Critical Behavior and Magnetocaloric Effect in Disordered Ferromagnets La0.7Ba0.3Mn1−x Ti x O3,2016,,,"<P>The Ti-substitution influence on the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of La0.7Ba0.3Mn1-x Ti (x) O-3 (x = 0.05 and 0.1) was investigated. Based on Banerjee's criteria and Franco's universal curves, we proved the existence of a second-order magnetic phase transition in the samples. Using the modified Arrott plot method, we determined the critical parameters T (C) a parts per thousand 245 K, beta = 0.374 +/- A 0.013, gamma = 1.228 +/- A 0.045, and delta = 4.26 +/- A 0.03 for x = 0.05, and T (C) a parts per thousand 169 K, beta = 0.339 +/- A 0.001, gamma = 1.307 +/- A 0.003, and delta = 4.78 +/- A 0.02 for x = 0.1. With these critical values, the predictable scaling behavior of the M(H) data above and below T (C) proves that the calculated exponents are unambiguous and intrinsic. The values beta = 0.374 for x = 0.05 and beta = 0.339 for x = 0.1 suggest that the magnetic phase transition of the samples falls into the three-dimensional (3D) Heisenberg and 3D Ising universality classes, respectively, corresponding to short-range ferromagnetic (FM) order due to FM clusters in a wide temperature range even above T (C), as confirmed by electron spin resonance studies. In reference to the magnetocaloric effect around T (C), the magnetic entropy change reaches maximum values (|Delta S-max|) of about 4 and 3 J kg(-1) K-1 for x = 0.05 and 0.1, respectively, for a magnetic field change 50 kOe. Magnetic field dependencies of |Delta S-max| obey a power function |Delta S-max(H)| ae H (n) , where exponent values n = 0.59 and 0.61 for x = 0.05 and 0.1, respectively, were determined from the relation n = 1 + (beta-1)/(beta + gamma). The difference between the experimental n values and the theoretical value n = 2/3 of the mean field model is due to the presence of short-range FM order in the samples.</P>",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Here scientism insists that social sciences should follow the methodology of natural science in the context that the subjects to be discussed are objective. Scientism in Public Administration covers Logical Positivism, Post-positivism and Behaviorism, which have influenced Public Administration. Human studies in Public Administration insist that social sciences have some aspects which can never be reduced to natural sciences, which means that social sciences have inherent elements distinguishablefrom natural sciences. They covers Phenomenology, Hermeneutics, Critical Theory. This paper analyzes the two above-mentioned streams through keyword review in the representative journals on Public Administration. The result shows us that human studies’ voices in Public Administration have been weak in comparison with the scientism.But nowadays scientism needs human studies and the latter needs the former as well. This paper accepts this trend and makes an effort for the harmony the two camps that have shown the antagonistic attitudes in Public Administration. For example, Thomas Kuhn’s paradigm theory has been identified as the effort to human studies from scientism, while T-G Model is recognizable to scientism from human studies.

Measurements were carried out during the daytime in autumn, a transient season that exhibits human thermal environments ranging from neutral to very hot. The mean air temperature and absolute humidity of the houses were 14.6-16.8℃ (max. 22. 3℃) and 7.0-12.0 g·m<sup>-3</sup> higher than those of the outdoor area, respectively. Solar (K) and terrestrial (L) radiation were compared directionally from the sky hemisphere (↓) and the ground hemisphere (↑). The mean K↓ and K↑ values for the houses were respectively 232.5-367.8 W·m<sup>-2</sup> and 44.9-55.7 W·m<sup>-2</sup> lower than those in the outdoor area; the mean L↓ and L↑ values were respectively 150.4-182.3 W·m<sup>-2</sup> and 30.5-33.9 W·m<sup>-2</sup> higher than those in the outdoor area. Thus, L was revealed to be more influential on the greenhouse effect in the houses than K. Consequently, mean radiant temperature in the houses was higher than the outdoor area during the daytime from 10:45 to 14:15. As a result, mean human thermal sensation values in the PMV, PET, and UTCI of the houses were respectively 3.2-3.4℃ (max. 4.7℃), 15.2-16.4℃ (max. 23.7℃) and 13.6-15.4℃ (max. 22.3℃) higher than those in the outdoor area. The heat stress levels that were influenced by human thermal sensation were much higher in the houses (between hot and very hot) than in the outdoor (between neutral and warm). Further, the microclimatic component that most affected the human thermal sensation in the houses was air temperature that was primarily influenced by L↓.

A Corpus-Based Analysis of Kasum ‘Chest/Breast’ in Korean,2016,,,"In recent years, much research has been carried out on body-part terms in expressing metonymic and metaphorical notions in terms of embodiment in cognitive linguistics. Among the terms, heart-centered expressions have been widely explored in English and other languages to show the significance of our bodily experiences in expressing our emotions as well as interpersonal or social relationships. However, little research has been carried out on the metaphoric expressions of chest or breast (cf. Kövecses 2002, Lakoff & Johnson 1980). The purpose of this research is to explore literal and metaphoric meanings of kasum ‘chest/ breast’ in a Korean written corpus in terms of corpus linguistics and conceptual metaphor (Perez 2008, Berendt, et al. n.d.). This research analyzes 2,373 tokens of kasum, 114 ces-kasum ‘milk-breast’ and 355 simcang ‘heart’ from the Sejong Project Corpus. Cognitive linguistic research has shown that the head is usually related to mind/reason but the heart to emotion/feelings in many languages. However, examination of the Korean data shows that simcang is used literally in most cases as a technical term in medical contexts, and that ces-kasum is used literally in most cases to refer to a woman’s breast. Unlike these two body-part terms, kasum is used as a cover term to express not only the upper body part literally but also an entity as a locus and perceiver of emotion/ feelings metaphorically. Examination of the corpus data shows the following major findings: (i) 819 tokens (34.5%) are used to refer to the body part chest literally, 1,512 tokens (63.7%) metaphorically (Deignan 2005), (ii) 921 tokens (38.8%) are used to show physiological responses in expressing emotion/feelings, using such terms as “the chest is aching, pounding, choking/being blocked, trembling, sinking, etc.”, (iii) 412 tokens (17.4%) are used to show kasum is a locus for emotion. As these findings show, in Korean, as folk knowledge contrary to the scientific knowledge about the roles of the brain, kasum is viewed as a locus or perceiver for emotional feelings in response to physical/ physiological stimuli. The findings show that the folk knowledge forms the basis for conceptual metaphor for kasum: (i) a locus for feelings, (ii) a container of emotions, (iii) an entity/a material, (iv) a storage/hiding place, etc. Finally, this research shows that in Korean, unlike in English and some other languages, kasum plays an important role in expressing emotional feelings, displaying conceptual metaphorical meanings derived from folk knowledge.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Although there are many prior studies examining the effects of the IFRS, the results are not consistent. The reason is because most prior studies focuses on short pre-adoption period(2009 and/or 2010 year). Because there are many different characteristics in IFRS compared to K-GAAP, it necessarily takes time for the stakeholders to understand and apply IFRS. Therefore, this study focus on the long period to examine the effect of IFRS adoption on value-relevance of accounting number. To do this, my research period is from 2000 to 2015.The empirical results are as follows. First, the combined(income and equity) value-relevance of post-adoption period is higher than that of pre-adoption period when the pre-adoption period is set long(from 2000 to 2010). However, the opposite result is found when the pre-adoption period is set short(from 2006 to 2010). These findings mean that the adoption of IFRS does not guarantee unconditional increase of value-relevance of accounting information. Second, the result shows that the incremental value-relevance of equity is significantly improved after IFRS adoption except for the firms with intensive intangible assets. Third, I find that the incremental value-relevance of income significantly decreases after IFRS　adoption except for loss firms. This paper analyzes the value-relevance effect of IFRS by comparing post-adoption period and two pre-adoption period(long and short) and implies the possible reason why prior literature finds mixed results about IFRS effects. In addition, this study has additional contribution to the IFRS literature by controlling the factors such as intangible-intensity, loss, Big 4 auditors, and difference in listing market(KOSPI vs KOSDAQ) that could have impact on the value-relevance of accounting information. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to have implication to accounting standards setter and users of accounting information.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

However, the quality of the IR image is often degraded by low resolution and noise corruption. This paper addresses target segmentation with the IR image. Multiple regions of interest (ROI) are extracted by the multi-level segmentation and targets are segmented from the individual ROI. Each level of the multi-level segmentation is composed of a k-means clustering algorithm an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and a decision process. The k-means clustering algorithm initializes the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the EM algorithm iteratively estimates those parameters. Each pixel is assigned to one of clusters during the decision. This paper proposes the selection and the merging of the extracted ROIs. ROI regions are selectively merged in order to include the overlapped ROI windows. In the experiments, the proposed method is tested on an IR image capturing two pedestrians at night. The performance is compared with conventional methods showing that the proposed method outperforms others.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Methods: To do this, we first applied five types of semi-automatic segmentation methods (i.e., level-set-based active contour model, localized region-based active contour model, seeded region growing, K-means clustering, and fuzzy C-means clustering) to preprocessed GGN images, respectively. Then, to measure the similarities, we calculated the Dice coefficient of the segmented area using each semiautomatic method with the result of the manually segmented area by two radiologists. Results: Comparison experiments were performed using 40 persistent GGNs. In our experiment, the mean Dice coefficient for each semiautomatic segmentation tool with manually segmented area was 0.808 for the level-set-based active contour model, 0.8001 for the localized region-based active contour model, 0.629 for seeded region growing, 0.7953 for K-means clustering, and 0.7999 for fuzzy C-means clustering, respectively. Conclusions: The level-set-based active contour model algorithm showed the best performance, which was most similar to the result of manual segmentation by two radiologists. From the differentiation between the normal parenchyma and the nodule, it was also the most efficient.

The effects of Nd/Yb double filling and Co substitution for Fe (charge compensation) on the microstructure, the charge transport, and the thermoelectric properties of the skutterudite specimens were investigated. All specimens were transformed to the skutterudite phase by the annealing process, and a few secondary phases such as marcasite FeSb2 were formed together with the skutterudite phase, although their formation was suppressed with increasing Co content. The lattice constant changed with the filling ratio of Nd/Yb and Fe/Co substitution, which meant that the double filling of Nd/Yb and the substitution of Co for Fe were successfully performed. All specimens showed p-type conduction at temperatures ranging from 323 K to 823 K and exhibited degenerate semiconductor characteristics, in which the electrical conductivity decreased and the Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing temperature. The Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing Nd and Co contents due to the decreased carrier concentration while the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity decreased. The maximum Seebeck coefficient was obtained at temperatures in the range from 723 K to 823 K, and the thermal conductivity significantly increased at temperatures above 623 K due to bipolar conduction. The dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, showed maximum values at temperatures ranging from 723 K to 823 K due to the decrease in the Seebeck coefficient (or the decrease in the power factor) and the increase in the thermal conductivity at high temperatures. The maximum ZT = 0.81 was obtained for Nd0.75Yb0.25Fe4Sb12 at 823 K and for Nd0.75Yb0.25Fe3CoSb12 at 723 K.</P>",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Prevalence of Frailty and Aging-Related Health Conditions in Older Koreans in Rural Communities: a Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Aging Study of Pyeongchang Rural Area,2016,"['Frailty', 'Sarcopenia', 'Disability', 'Geriatrics', 'Population Health', 'Aged']",,"<P>Frailty has been previously studied in Western countries and the urban Korean population; however, the burden of frailty and geriatric conditions in the aging populations of rural Korean communities had not yet been determined. Thus, we established a population-based prospective study of adults aged ≥ 65 years residing in rural communities of Korea between October 2014 and December 2014. All participants underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment that encompassed the assessment of cognitive and physical function, depression, nutrition, and body composition using bioimpedance analysis. We determined the prevalence of frailty based on the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Korean version of FRAIL (K-FRAIL) criteria, as well as geriatric conditions. We recruited 382 adults (98% of eligible adults; mean age: 74 years; 56% women). Generally, sociodemographic characteristics were similar to those of the general rural Korean population. Common geriatric conditions included instrumental activity of daily living disability (39%), malnutrition risk (38%), cognitive dysfunction (33%), multimorbidity (32%), and sarcopenia (28%), while dismobility (8%), incontinence (8%), and polypharmacy (3%) were less common conditions. While more individuals were classified as frail according to the K-FRAIL criteria (27%) than the CHS criteria (17%), the CHS criteria were more strongly associated with prevalent geriatric conditions. Older Koreans living in rural communities have a significant burden of frailty and geriatric conditions that increase the risk of functional decline, poor quality of life, and mortality. The current study provides a basis to guide public health professionals and policy-makers in prioritizing certain areas of care and designing effective public health interventions to promote healthy aging of this vulnerable population.</P>",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
프로젝트 파이낸스 사업의 투자타당성 분석기법 재검토 -유한한 사업수명과 시간가변적 자본비용을 반영하는 사례연구-,2016,"['프로젝트 파이낸스', '유한한 사업수명의 투자안', '투자타당성 분석', 'Project Finance', 'Finite Project Life', 'Capital Budgeting', 'NPV', 'IRR']","유한한 사업수명을 가진 투자안에 대한 투자타당성 분석기법으로서 순현가법(NPV) 및 내부수익율법(IRR)이 전통적인 기법으로서 널리 인정받고 있다. 전통적인 투자타당성 분석기법을 재검토하게 된 배경은 프로젝트 파이낸스(이하 “PF”) 사업의 특징은 사업수명이 유한할뿐만 아니라 사업주체인 특수목적회사(이하 “SPC”)의 부채조달액에 대한 상환소구권이 제한되는 사업특성이 투자타당성 과정에 반영되어야하기 때문이다. 사업수명이 유한하면 PF가 향유하는 절세액의 지속기간도 유한하고, 자금조달도 SPC의 현금흐름을 거의 유일한 담보로 이루어지기 때문에 자본비용이 상대적으로 더 높을 것으로 예상되기 때문이다. PF 투자안의 평가에 있어 유한한 사업수명과 절세효과, 시간가변적 자본구조와 자본비용등 PF의 특성을 적절하게 반영하여 NPV 및 IRR기법을 적용하는 투자타당성 분석사례를 제시하고자 한다. 본 사례연구에 적용하는 시간가변적 자본비용으로서 투자안의 세후 가중평균자본비용(Ko), 세전 가중평균자본비용(K<sub>BT</sub>) 및 자기자본비용(Ke) 모형은 Campani(2015), 이원흠(2015)을 응용하여 도출한다. 또한 동일한 투자타당성 분석결과를 보이는 PF 투자안의 가치평가 모형으로서 APV(Ku)모형, FCF(Ko)모형, CCF(K<sub>BT</sub>)모형 및 CFE(Ke)모형을 도출하고 사례연구에 적용한다. 본 연구의 사례분석 결과를 통해 살펴보면 PF 투자안의 사업수명이 유한하면 투자안의 자본비용은 유한한 절세효과의 지속기간 차이 때문에 계속기업에 비해 자본비용이 크게 추정된다. 자본구조가 사업기간 중 변화하므로 투자안의 자본비용도 매기 변하게 된다. 따라서 시간가변적 자본비용을 적용해 NPV기법을 적용하는데 문제가 없으나, IRR기법을 적용하는데에는 문제가 야기된다, 본 연구에서는 시간불변적인 무부채조달 사업의 자본비용 Ku를 투자거부율로 활용하면 PF 투자안에 대한 분석기법으로서 IRR기법을 올바로 적용할 수 있다는 것도 보였다.","It is considered to be the proper techniques for evaluating investment projects, which apply both the NPV and IRR rules. These traditional capital budgeting methods are established ingeneral for the infinite-life project, which is usually assumed to have a constant leverage ratio and then a constant cost of capital. This is the reason why for capital budgeting of the finite time-horizon project finance(hereafter PF) we have to take into considerations the proper adjustments in the traditional techniques. In this study I develop time-varying valuation models such as APV(K<sub>U</sub>), FCF(K<sub>O</sub>, and CCF(K<sub>BT</sub> for capital budgeting of the finite-life PF projects, taking into account both the finite tax benefits during the project life and also time-varying aspects in the cost of capital. And I can show all the PF valuation models to have the same project values for capital budgeting purpose. It means that the proposed valuation models taking into account the time-varying cost of capital can conclude that the newly proposed NPV rule can be applied consistently for the finite life PF projects. Based on the case study addressing the newly proposed valuation models to adjust the time-varying cost of capital, I can conclude that the traditional evaluation techniques for the infinite-life project have to be revised in case of evaluating the finite-life PF projects.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
Stabilization of metastable ɛ-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin films using a GaFeO<sub>3</sub> buffer,2016,,,"<P>This paper reports a simple and robust route to stabilize metastable epsilon-Fe2O3 as an epitaxial thin film using a GaFeO3 (GFO) buffer in pulsed laser deposition. The use of an isostructural GFO buffer widens the range of film growth, allowing for stabilization on a range of substrates even with different surface symmetries, such as Al2O3 (0001), SrTiO3 (111), and Y:ZrO2 (100). All films grown on these substrates were c-axis oriented with the characteristic in-plane domain structures. Magnetization of these buffered thin films showed considerable magnetic anisotropy at 350 K. In particular, in-plane magnetization was found to be relatively larger in the films grown on the Y: ZrO2 (100) compared to the other cases. Heterostructuring epsilon-Fe2O3 on GFO is promising in the applications of epsilon-Fe2O3 for magnetic and multiferroic devices in that it provides a larger growth window and an effective means to optimize the film properties beyond the simple substitution of Fe with Ga.

Multi-Level Segmentation of Infrared Images with Region of Interest Extraction,2016,"['Infrared image segmentation', 'Region of interest extraction', 'Multilevel segmentation', 'Gaussian mixture modeling', 'Statistical image processing']",,"Infrared (IR) imaging has been researched for various applications such as surveillance.IR radiation has the capability to detect thermal characteristics of objects under low-light conditions. However, automatic segmentation for finding the object of interest would be challenging since the IR detector often provides the low spatial and contrast resolution image without color and texture information. Another hindrance is that the image can be degraded by noise and clutters. This paper proposes multi-level segmentation for extracting regions of interest (ROIs) and objects of interest (OOIs) in the IR scene. Each level of the multi-level segmentation is composed of a k-means clustering algorithm, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and a decision process. The k-means clustering initializes the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and the EM algorithm estimates those parameters iteratively. During the multi-level segmentation, the area extracted at one level becomes the input to the next level segmentation. Thus, the segmentation is consecutively performed narrowing the area to be processed. The foreground objects are individually extracted from the final ROI windows. In the experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using several IR images, in which human subjects are captured at a long distance.The average probability of error is shown to be lower than that obtained from other conventional methods such as Gonzalez, Otsu, k-means, and EM methods",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Analysis of Molecular Variance and Population Structure in Southern Indian Finger Millet Genotypes Using Three Different Molecular Markers,2016,"['AMOVA', 'population structure', 'finger millet', 'molecular marker']",,"The genetic relationship among 42 genotypes of finger millet collected from different geographical regions of southern India was investigated using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR), and simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. Ten RAPD primers produced 111 polymorphic bands. Five ISSR primers produced a total of 61 bands. Of these, 23 bands were polymorphic. The RAPD and ISSR fingerprints revealed 71.3 and 37.4% polymorphic banding patterns, respectively. Thirty-six SSR primers yielded 83 scorable alleles in which 62 were found to be polymorphic.Out of 36 SSR primers used, 14 primers (46.6%) produced polymorphic bands. The SSR primer UGEP7 produced a maximum number of six alleles. Mean polymorphic information content (PIC) of RAPD, ISSR and SSR were 0.44, 0.28, and 0.14, respectively. Molecular variances among the population were 2, 11, and 1% for RAPD, ISSR, and SSR markers, respectively. SSR produced 99% molecular variance within individuals. RAPD and ISSR markers produced a low level of molecular variance within individuals. The STRUCTURE (model-based program) analysis revealed that the 42 finger millet genotypes could be divided into a maximum of four subpopulations. Based on the Bayesian statistics, each RAPD and SSR marker produced three subpopulations (K=3), while ISSR marker showed four subpopulations (K=4). This study revealed that RAPD and SSR markers could narrow down the analysis of population structure and it may form the basis for finger millet breeding and improvement programs in the future.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

In general, long-term forecasting of power demand has been studied from both the consumer’s perspective and an econometrics model in the form of a generalized linear model with predictors. Time series techniques are used for short-term forecasting with no predictors as predictors must be predicted prior to forecasting response variables and containing estimation errors during this process is inevitable. In previous researches, seasonal exponential smoothing method, SARMA (Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average) with consideration to weekly pattern Neuron-Fuzzy model, SVR (Support Vector Regression) model with predictors explored through machine learning, and K-means clustering technique in the various approaches have been applied to short-term power supply forecasting.

A Relationship between Depression and Wandering in Community-Dwelling Elders with Dementia,2016,"['wandering', 'dementia', 'depression.']",,"Background and PurposeWandering is one of the most common behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and associated with some of the adverse outcomes in dementia, such as getting lost or even death. The etiology of wandering is not yet clearly known. As depression and wandering are both very common among the patients with dementia, this study examined the relationship between the depression and wandering among the community dwelling patients with dementia.MethodsFifty community dwelling patients diagnosed with dementia were included in this study if they had primary family caregiver, older than age 18 in Seoul, South Korea. The Geriatric Depression Scale, Korean Version (GDS-K), Korean Version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) and Korean Version of Revised Algase Wandering Scale-Community Version (K-RAWS-CV) were used to measure the severity of depression, cognitive function and wandering.ResultsThirty percents of the patients showed wandering. Mean score of GDS-K was significantly higher in wanderers than non-wanderers. Severity of depression was significantly correlated with the total score of K-RAWS-CV and subscales of persistent walking, repetitive walking, eloping behavior, and mealtime impulsivity in whole sample. K-MMSE score also was related to wandering behavior. The prevalence odds ratio for wandering in depressed patients compared with undepressed group was 8.386 (95% confidence interval: 1.978–35.561).ConclusionsThis study implicates that not only cognitive impairment but also psychosocial aspects should be considered in wandering patients with dementia and suggests assessing the depression in patients would be helpful in identifying the causes of wandering.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Discrimination of <i>Polygonatum</i> species and identification of novel markers using <sup>1</sup>H NMR‐ and UPLC/Q‐TOF MS‐based metabolite profiling,2016,"['Polygonatum', 'species discrimination', 'herbal medicine', 'metabolite profiling', '1H NMR', 'UPLC/Q&#x2010']",,"<P>BACKGROUNDRhizomes of Polygonatum species are commonly used as herbal supplements in Asia. They have different medicinal effects by species but have been misused and mixed owing to their similar taste and smell. Therefore accurate and reliable analytical methods to discriminate between Polygonatum species are required. RESULTSIn this study, global and targeted metabolite profiling using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) was applied to discriminate between different Polygonatum species. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were used to classify and predict species of Polygonatum. Cross-validation derived from PLS-DA revealed good predictive accuracy. Polygonatum species were classified into unique patterns based on K-means clustering analysis. 4-Hydrobenzoic acid and trigonelline were identified as novel marker compounds and quantified accurately. CONCLUSIONThe results demonstrate that metabolite profiling approaches coupled with chemometric analysis can be used to classify and discriminate between different species of various herbal medicines.

Charge Transport and Thermoelectric Properties of Double-filled Nd1−zYbzFe4−xCoxSb12 Skutterudites,2016,"['Thermoelectric', 'Skutterudite', 'Double filling', 'Charge compensation']",,"p-Type Nd1−zYbzFe4−xCoxSb12 (z = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and x = 0, 0.5, 1.0) skutterudites were synthesized by using encapsulated melting and hot pressing. The effects of Nd/Yb double filling and Co substitution for Fe (charge compensation) on the microstructure, the charge transport, and the thermoelectric properties of the skutterudite specimens were investigated. All specimens were transformed to the skutterudite phase by the annealing process, and a few secondary phases such as marcasite FeSb2 were formed together with the skutterudite phase, although their formation was suppressed with increasing Co content. The lattice constant changed with the filling ratio of Nd/Yb and Fe/Co substitution, which meant that the double filling of Nd/Yb and the substitution of Co for Fe were successfully performed. All specimens showed p-type conduction at temperatures ranging from 323 K to 823 K and exhibited degenerate semiconductor characteristics, in which the electrical conductivity decreased and the Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing temperature.The Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing Nd and Co contents due to the decreased carrier concentration while the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity decreased. The maximum Seebeck coefficient was obtained at temperatures in the range from 723 K to 823 K, and the thermal conductivity significantly increased at temperatures above 623 K due to bipolar conduction.The dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, showed maximum values at temperatures ranging from 723 K to 823 K due to the decrease in the Seebeck coefficient (or the decrease in the power factor) and the increase in the thermal conductivity at high temperatures.

Thus, we established a populationbased prospective study of adults aged ≥ 65 years residing in rural communities of Korea between October 2014 and December 2014. All participants underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment that encompassed the assessment of cognitive and physical function, depression, nutrition, and body composition using bioimpedance analysis. We determined the prevalence of frailty based on the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Korean version of FRAIL (K-FRAIL) criteria, as well as geriatric conditions. We recruited 382 adults (98% of eligible adults; mean age: 74 years; 56% women). Generally, sociodemographic characteristics were similar to those of the general rural Korean population. Common geriatric conditions included instrumental activity of daily living disability (39%), malnutrition risk (38%), cognitive dysfunction (33%), multimorbidity (32%), and sarcopenia (28%), while dismobility (8%), incontinence (8%), and polypharmacy (3%) were less common conditions. While more individuals were classified as frail according to the K-FRAIL criteria (27%) than the CHS criteria (17%), the CHS criteria were more strongly associated with prevalent geriatric conditions. Older Koreans living in rural communities have a significant burden of frailty and geriatric conditions that increase the risk of functional decline, poor quality of life, and mortality. The current study provides a basis to guide public health professionals and policy-makers in prioritizing certain areas of care and designing effective public health interventions to promote healthy aging of this vulnerable population.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
Multi-Level Segmentation of Infrared Images with Region of Interest Extraction,2016,"['Infrared image segmentation', 'Region of interest extraction', 'Multilevel segmentation', 'Gaussian mixture modeling', 'Statistical image processing']",,"Infrared (IR) imaging has been researched for various applications such as surveillance. IR radiation has the capability to detect thermal characteristics of objects under low-light conditions. However, automatic segmentation for finding the object of interest would be challenging since the IR detector often provides the low spatial and contrast resolution image without color and texture information. Another hindrance is that the image can be degraded by noise and clutters. This paper proposes multi-level segmentation for extracting regions of interest (ROIs) and objects of interest (OOIs) in the IR scene. Each level of the multi-level segmentation is composed of a k-means clustering algorithm, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and a decision process. The k-means clustering initializes the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and the EM algorithm estimates those parameters iteratively. During the multi-level segmentation, the area extracted at one level becomes the input to the next level segmentation. Thus, the segmentation is consecutively performed narrowing the area to be processed. The foreground objects are individually extracted from the final ROI windows. In the experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using several IR images, in which human subjects are captured at a long distance. The average probability of error is shown to be lower than that obtained from other conventional methods such as Gonzalez, Otsu, k-means, and EM methods.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Soil samples were collected from 190 fields and assessed the effects of management practices on soil chemical properties at wild edible plant fields under no-till system. The strong acidic soils of pH 5.4 or less were detected in 45% of the soil samples. The level of soil organic matter was being held at mean 63±28 g kg-1, 2.7 times higher than upland soils in Korea. Available phosphate and exchangeable potassium showed more than recommended levels of upland crops as 680±489 mg kg-1 and 1.94±1.7 cmolc kg-1, respectively. The fields of Solidago and Aster showing strong soil acidity and high level of available phosphate and water soluble NO3- were distinguished from other crops in analysis of variance and principal component analysis of soil chemicals. These results suggested that high frequency of acidic soil and high levels of available P2O5, exchangeable K2O and water soluble NO3- were accompanied with the use of urea and NPK-fertilizer based on nitrogen in the field.

The Buddha images with the right shoulder exposed have two types in expression of their drapery. As this form and iconography of the standing Buddha image has no precedents, it seems to have newly introduced after 7<SUP>th</SUP> century.

The standing Buddha image with no drapery, which has twisted waist from Suksusa-ji temple site, looks like the style of Buddha image at Ajanta Caves in Western India. It means this type of Buddha image came from western India to Silla via Southeast Asia.

Inferring tweet location inference for twitter mining,2016,"['Twitter mining', 'SNS', 'Stream data', 'Location inference', 'City monitoring']",,"A tweet, possessing various facets, is created at the speed of thought, propagated in real time and produces social interchange on an international scale. As a result, users demand the analysis of twitter mining with a map to search for trendy topics or ﬁnd what is being talked about among users. Due to the sparsity of location information, however, there are real difﬁculties in analysis related to position information. To run Twitter mining on all Korean users, this study used ﬁrehose level, which is massive 100 % twitter data, while utilizing a new spatial indicator to overcome the sparsity of location information. Furthermore, the study suggested an algorithm to process ﬁrehose data and solutions to overcome the study’s limit. The conventional method of using spritzer level data and the supervised method resulted in 44 times more positions inferred on a tweet than the method using geotag, whereas the method used in this study saw inferences rise 680 fold. In the case of the clustering algorithm, the method of K-Center Clustering was found to have inferred the most number of user residential locations. The ultimate goal of the study is for the twitter data, including the massive volume of location information inferred and created in real time, to serve as a means of city monitoring by overcoming the study’s limit, which is automated reﬁning of unnecessary words for proﬁle location information and twitter mining.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Participants of the study were the patients with chronic schizophrenia who being diagnosed by DSM-IV, the primary participants were eight patients who had difficulty in self-expression and interpersonal relationships due to lack of interactions while they were residing in a rehabilitation facility after discharging from a mental hospital. The period of the study was June to September of 2013, and the study were conducted with a total of 18 sessions for 60 minutes, and twice a week. The process of the study focused on improvement of self-expression and interactions by helping the patients who had difficulty in personal relationships and psychological problems through the process of the early, middle, late and termination stage. Evaluation method of the study used mixed methods of quantitative research and qualitative research. Self-Directed Assertiveness Scale (SDAS) and Relationship Change Scale (RCS) of examination of the interpersonal change were used for quantitative research by an analysis of before and after sessions. For the study of qualitative analysis, the researcher recoded 200 coding of expressive languages and behaviors through the relationships between group members during the process of the study. Through the process of recording, a research found three themes of ‘self-expression’ such as expression of feelings, expression of opinion, and self-disclosure, ‘interaction’ such as intimacy and confidence, and ‘awareness of reality’ such as awareness of situation and plan. The researcher analyzed an individual's psychological dynamics and changes of interactions with others through pretest and posttest of K-HTP (Kinetic-House, Tree, Person) drawings. The results of this study were as the following. First, according to the results of the differences between pre and posttest of self-expression through expressive group arts psychotherapy, a mean score of the pretest was 2.83 (SD = .83), and the mean score of the posttest was 3.63 (SD = .47). The result statistically showed significant difference (t = -3.97, p < .05). The results suggested that the expressive group arts psychotherapy helped the patients with chronic schizophrenia who have problems with self-expression by expressing their thoughts, desires and feelings appropriately through movement of body and media of arts. The expressive group arts psychotherapy provided positive effects on self-expression and interactions. Second, according to the results of the interpersonal differences between pre and posttest, a mean score of pretest was 3.23 (SD = .61), the mean score of posttest was 3.61 (SD = .41). The results statistically showed significant difference (t = -3.00, p < .05). The results suggested that the expressive group arts psychotherapy gave the patient a positive impact on mental health by providing positive interactions, supports, experiences and accomplishment. Third, the results of K-HTP drawing tests, an emotional state, desire, an individual psychological dynamics, and interactions with others showed positive changes on the results of pre and posttest. The results of the pretest of K-HTP drawings, the patients showed a negative themes such as an emotional anxiety, inner conflict, social disconnection and avoidance with interpersonal relationships, pathological fantasies and aggressive self-fulfillment. On the other hand, the results of the posttest, the patients showed an improvement of interpersonal relationships and the changes of self by awareness of the reality from delusion and fantasy by having an emotional stability and interaction. This results showed that the patients experienced positive effects on the expression and awareness of self through the expressive group arts psychotherapy. Finally, the results of the qualitative analysis through the process of expressive group arts psychotherapy, the study found three themes of ‘self-expression’ through expression of feelings, expression of opinion, and self-disclosure, ‘interaction’ through intimacy and confidence, and ‘awareness of reality’ through awareness of situation and plan. These results of expressive group arts psychotherapy coincided with Yalom’s therapeutic factors of group psychotherapy, which ‘self-expression’ coincide with ‘catharsis’, ‘interaction’ coincide with ‘installation of hope’ and ‘group cohesiveness’, and ‘awareness of reality’ coincide with ‘development of socializing techniques’ and interpersonal learning’. herefore, the results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis found that the expressive group arts psychotherapy showed positive effects on self expression and interaction of the patients with chronic schizophrenia who stayed in rehabilitation facility by providing an emotional stability for the patients who had difficulty in anxiety and psychological problems.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The PRIDE model is constructed by combining the PRISM module, the Regional Climate Model (RCM) anomaly, and quantile mapping (QM) to produce high-resolution (1 km) grid data at a daily time scale. The results show that the systematic bias of the RCM was significantly reduced by simply substituting the climatological observational seasonal cycle at a daily timescale for each grid point obtained from the PRISM. QM was then applied to correct additional systematic bias by constructing the transfer functions under the cumulative density function framework between the model and observation using six types of transfer functions. K-fold cross-validation of the PRIDE model shows that the number of modeled precipitation days is approximately 90~121% of the number of observed precipitation days for the five daily precipitation classes, indicating that the PRIDE model reasonably estimates the observational frequency of daily precipitation under a quantile framework. The relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is also discussed in the framework of the intensity of daily precipitation.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

One of the major purposes of public pension system is to reduce economic inequalities across population groups that have been mainly defined by a single variable such as age, income, sex, etc in the literature. This paper aims to evaluate how well the population groups are practically and clearly designed in the literature so as to specify economic inequalities across different groups.For this purpose, we investigate the retired household sample obtained from KLIPS (Korean Labor and Income Panel Study) and conduct the clustering analysis to organize population groups. The clustering analysis consists of four steps: variable selection, hierarchical clustering analysis to determine the number of clusters and centroid, non-hierarchical clustering analysis (we use K-means clustering analysis) and define population groups, and describing the characteristics of population groups. The clustering analysis divides the population into six subgroups that have similar characteristics.We compare the characteristics of the population groups obtained from the clustering analysis with those designed in the literature with respect to household, income, consumption and asset. From the comparison, we observe that the assumptions on population groups in the literature are somewhat different from the findings from the clustering analysis. In particular, the period of employment and the full-time period are significantly different from the literature. The clustering analysis reveals that the period of employment is approximately 31-45 years, which is shorter than the period of employment assumed in the literature. Furthermore, few research has clearly considered the full-time period, which accounts for 14%-45% of the total period of employment. We believe that the findings in this study provides meaningful information on how to practically organize population groups as a part of designing public pension system. For example, researchers are encouraged to consider the employment periods and full-time periods obtained from the data analysis when considering the significant impact of working periods on pension payment and benefits.Population should be well grouped so as to specify the difference in economic inequalities across groups. In general, various variables are jointly involved in determining the economic inequalities, but populations have been simply grouped by a single variable such as age, gender, education level, household size, etc. in the literature. This paper employs the Generalized Entropy (GE) measure of economic inequality and its decomposition to evaluate the contributions of several variables on the overall economic inequality. For this analysis, populations are first grouped by several variables such as clusters obtained from the analysis, sex, education level, period of employment and household size. Then, we measure the inequaltiy index and its decomposition for monthly income, monthly consumption and asset.Grouping populations using the clustering analysis specifies the economic inequality more precisely provides better measure of similarity within a group and difference between groups. This result supports the effectiveness of the clustering analysis in grouping populations.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

"Toward A Reconciliation of Two Old Testament Disciplines, ‘History of Ancient Israel’ and ‘Old Testament Theology’",2016,"['Old Testament Theology', 'Normative Task', 'History of Ancient Israel']",,"This paper suggests a way of reconciliating two Old Testament disciplines, 'history of ancient Israel' and 'Old Testament theology,' considering a debate of minimalist and maximalist on the history of ancient Israel. Since J. P. Gabler, the historical discipline and the theological discipline have grown to separate enterprises in the field of Old Testament interpretation. Eichrodt and von Rad are good samples for this. The key lies in the concept of history and its assumptions.To reconcile these two Old Testament disciplines, I suggest to take some conceptual procedures. 1) A dichotomy of history versus theology as well as fact versus fiction should be overcome. For history is a kind of literature and a result of interpretation. Both history and theology are interpreted constructs. Also fiction has elements of the reality elements in it. That’s why fiction can be construed as a reality. 2) ""What it meant"" and ""what it means"" could be bridged with the help of hermeneutics, as K. Standahl pointed out. As a Korean, I suggest that Gadamer's hermeneutics of integration may be efficient. Ancient Israel and Korean experienced advanced agrarian society, which is a common ground. 3) Through the lens of dynamics of agrarian society, historical approaches to the Old Testament can be appropriated as theological interpretations for Korean faith community, in terms of ""dynamics of historical analogy."" 4) Biblical accounts may be read like a ""virtual reality"" of the computer game. Elements of fiction come from the reality. Without the real, no fiction can be construed at all. So let the Korean Old Testament theologians play with deadly seriousness the game of the Bible.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Superpixel-based Vehicle Detection using Plane Normal Vector in Dispar ity Space,2016,"['Normal Vector Computation', 'Stereo Matching', 'Superpixel Segmentation', 'Free Space Estimation', 'Vehicle Detection']",,"This paper proposes a framework of superpixel-based vehicle detection method using plane normal vector in disparity space. We utilize two common factors for detecting vehicles: Hypothesis Generation (HG) and Hypothesis Verification (HV). At the stage of HG, we set the regions of interest (ROI) by estimating the lane, and track them to reduce computational cost of the overall processes. The image is then divided into compact superpixels, each of which is viewed as a plane composed of the normal vector in disparity space. After that, the representative normal vector is computed at a superpixel-level, which alleviates the well-known problems of conventional color-based and depth-based approaches.Based on the assumption that the central-bottom of the input image is always on the navigable region, the road and obstacle candidates are simultaneously extracted by the plane normal vectors obtained from K-means algorithm. At the stage of HV, the separated obstacle candidates are verified by employing HOG and SVM as for a feature and classifying function, respectively. To achieve this, we trained SVM classifier by HOG features of KITTI training dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle detection system outperforms the conventional HOG-based methods qualitatively and quantitatively.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Superpixel-based Vehicle Detection using Plane Normal Vector in Dispar ity Space,2016,"['Normal Vector Computation', 'Stereo Matching', 'Superpixel Segmentation', 'Free Space Estimation', 'Vehicle Detection']",,"This paper proposes a framework of superpixel-based vehicle detection method using plane normal vector in disparity space. We utilize two common factors for detecting vehicles: Hypothesis Generation (HG) and Hypothesis Verification (HV). At the stage of HG, we set the regions of interest (ROI) by estimating the lane, and track them to reduce computational cost of the overall processes. The image is then divided into compact superpixels, each of which is viewed as a plane composed of the normal vector in disparity space. After that, the representative normal vector is computed at a superpixel-level, which alleviates the well-known problems of conventional color-based and depth-based approaches. Based on the assumption that the central-bottom of the input image is always on the navigable region, the road and obstacle candidates are simultaneously extracted by the plane normal vectors obtained from K-means algorithm. At the stage of HV, the separated obstacle candidates are verified by employing HOG and SVM as for a feature and classifying function, respectively. To achieve this, we trained SVM classifier by HOG features of KITTI training dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle detection system outperforms the conventional HOG-based methods qualitatively and quantitatively.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

It is considered consumption characteristics as a significant analysis subject in terms of social welfare because it could be understood as an expressed need which was a reflection of desire. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the consumption characteristics of the elderly households by stereotyping the consumption pattern of the elderly households, and find the determining factors for consumption patterns and thus contribute to the establishment of related policies through the expressed needs of the elderly households. K-means of cluster analysis was performed by putting the consumption expenditure of the elderly households to investigate inherent structural type of consumption pattern of the elderly households, which were the investigation subjects. As a result, four groups were stereotyped and named as below: ‘health care-centered type’, ‘saving-centered type’, ‘livelihood-centered type’, and ‘food expenses-centered type’ Binary Logistic Regression analysis was used to identify the factors that influence the decision of consumption pattern of the elderly households. The result of study showed that the elderly households faced all different needs and problems and thus there is a need for various approach plans to solve this situation. In particular, although the elderly have been viewed as economically poor people so far, the study showed that there were also kind of prepared households through saving. Overall, livelihood- centered type accounted for the highest portion and, as a factor that influenced this, marital state and household income played an important role. Therefore, it is considered that more active efforts to increase the income of the elderly households are needed. In addition, age, owning of house and subjective health state were found to also have significant influence. Through these results of the study, the elderly’s own improvement of awareness on health, presentation of overall standard for health state of the elderly, securement of the elderly’s access to cultural life, and financial management coordination for improvement of quality of life, development and dissemination of jobs suitable for the elderly, and dissemination of communal life household, which is a cooperation residential type, were presented as institutional task in the conclusion.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Āyurveda seeks not only physical health and longevity, but also complete health of body and soul (mokṣa). In this sense, Āyurveda embraces health-views accumulated from the modern and contemporary times. Āyurvedic understanding of human body is different from mechanistic views of human body based on Newtonian physics. It does not define human body as a material just oriented by time and space, rather as a continuing flow and process. This kind of understanding on human body adopts the same stance as quantum physics to understand material particles as a process made up of constantly changing waves as elements of the world. According to Āyurveda, it is agni that leads each element of human body to preserve dynamic constancy as a changing process. In this regard, it is within bounds to say that agni is a core concept of medical science system of Āyurveda. Agni is an essence of health (svāthya). Agni is a root(mūla) and the most significant supporting factor of all living things. The internal medicine (kāya-cikitsā), a core element of Āyurveda is identical to preserving agni, which directly shows the importance of agni in Āyurveda.  The purpose of this paper is to define the meaning of agni in Āyurveda. Many kinds of therapy and mechanism of Āyurveda are already being employed in various ways in domestic markets related to yoga, beauty, oriental medicine, psychical cure, etc. Despite this fact, the concept of agni in Āyurveda has not been studied in a detailed and systematic fashion.

In the third chapter, the paper deals with the concept of agni in Caraka-saṃhitā, Suśuruta-saṃhitā and Aṣṭāṅga Hṛdayam, the major scriptures of Āyurveda.

독일 낭만주의 문학과 사상에서 나타난 ‘밤’의 상징적 의미 - 노발리스의 「밤의 찬가」와 니체의 「밤의 노래」를 중심으로,2016,"['니체', '노발리스', '밤', '낭만주의', '예술', 'Nietzsche', 'Novalis', 'Night', 'Romanticism', 'Art..']","이 글은 본 논문은 18세기말경에 활동한 독일의 초기 낭만주의자인 노발리스와 19세기의 독일철학자 프리드리히 니체의 작품에 공통적으로 내재된 ‘밤’의 분위기와 그 상징적 의미에 대한 비교연구이다. 두 사람의 활동기간이 길게는 거의 1세기 가까이 차이가 남에도 불구하고, 그들의 문체와 사상에는 다양한 유사성이 발견된다. 그들은 예술의 중요성을 강조하고, 자신들의 작품을 통해 예술과 사상의 결합을 시도하였다. 노발리스가 철학적 예술가였다면, 니체는 예술적 철학자였다. 경계를 넘어서려는 이들의 시도는 독일적인 사유의 지평을 확대하였음은 물론이고, 예술가적 창조의 전형을 보여주었다. ‘밤’은 예술적 직관이 가장 왕성하게 작용하도록 하는 상상과 꿈의 시간이다. 노발리스에게 신성한 ‘밤’은 모든 시공간의 구분이 사라지고 태초의 시간으로 되돌아가는 순간이며, 니체에게 깊은 ‘밤’인 자정은 위대한 정오로도 통하는 ‘영원회귀’의 시간이기도 하다. 이러한 신비주의적 시간인 ‘밤’의 관점에서 볼 때 낭만주의자로서의 니체의 모습이 드러난다. 디오니소스적 시간인 ‘밤’은 어둡지만, 인간의 상상력을 최대한 자극시키는 가장 창조인 시간이기 때문이다.","This paper explores the meaning and atmosphere of ‘Night’ in Novalis(autonym: Friedrich von Hardenberg,1772-1801) and Nietzsche(1844-1900). Novalis had a very short literary career in the late 18th century, and Nietzsche published his writings from 1872 to 1889. Although they lived and wrote in different periods, they had many affinities in style and thought. Both stressed the importance of art, therefore, tried to produce a combination of art and philosophy. If Novalis was an philosophical artist(poet), Nietzsche was artistic philosopher. They attempted to overcome the limits of separate and individual disciplines, expanding the horizon of German thought and literature. ‘Night’ is a German motive that was commonly discovered in their writings. In German thought and Romantic literature, ‘Night’ is the time of dream and imagination. In Novalis’s “The Hymn of the Night”, the holy ‘Night’ is the moment that makes a division of time and space disappear. According to his diary, he saw a phantasm of his dead fiancee, Sophie von Kühn and composed a poem about this experience. He sang ‘Night’ as a time of ‘eros’ and salvation. His poems seem to be Christian on the surface, but have German mystical tradition behind the text. This trend served as a basis for Jena Romanticism. In Nietzsche’s Thus spoke Zarathustra, the ‘mid-night’ connects with noon. Nietzsche as a Dionysian thinker had a special interest in the ‘night’ that Dionysus became to prevail over Apollo. In Zarathustra’s “the Night-Song”, Nietzsche sang of an innermost psychological state. He described his own loneliness in seeking a wisdom. Here, he thought of himself as a singer of Dithyramb. In “the Sleepwalker’s Song”, Zarathustra expressed the disappearance of distinctions in time and space. At Dionysian night, all opposition disappears and the riddle of “eternal recurrence” is solved. This mysterious ‘Night’ made Nietzsche a kind of romanticist who dreamed of an artistic illusion.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Regardless of the fact that the three episodes of “sharing the seat”, “picking up a flower”, and “displaying both legs” originated from India or China, each episode was connected to the Chan (K. Seon, 禪) claim of separation from and even of superiority to Jiao(敎, doctrines) in medieval China. However, “Samcheojeonsim” was first used in Korean Seon texts as an umbrella term for those three episodes. It was also in Korea that the religious meaning of the existence of multiple mind-transmission episodes was sought for the first time in Chan and Seon history. In particular, the 19th century JoseonSeon master BaekpaGeungseon (白坡亘璇) justified the superiority of the Linji (K. Imje臨濟) school, which the Korean Seon community of the time claimed to be affiliated with, through his hierarchical interpretation of the term. His interpretation has generated various discussions and controversies on the origin and meaning of the term. Such pre-modern figures as ChouiUisun(草衣意恂), KimJeong-hui(金正喜), and SeolduYuhyeong(雪竇有炯), as well as modern scholars, including NukariyaKaiten(忽滑谷快天), Bak Han-yeong(朴漢永), and Kim Dong-hwa(金東華) also joined the discussions.

In the big data age, there are too many information sources to refer to when making decisions. For example, when considering travel to a city, a person may search reviews from a search engine such as Google or social networking services (SNSs) such as blogs, Twitter, and Facebook. The emotional polarity of positive and negative reviews helps a user decide on whether or not to make a trip. Sentiment analysis of customer reviews has become an important research topic as datamining technology is widely accepted for text mining of the Web. Sentiment analysis has been used to classify documents through machine learning techniques, such as the decision tree, neural networks, and support vector machines (SVMs). is used to determine the attitude, position, and sensibility of people who write articles about various topics that are published on the Web. Regardless of the polarity of customer reviews, emotional reviews are very helpful materials for analyzing the opinions of customers through their reviews. Sentiment analysis helps with understanding what customers really want instantly through the help of automated text mining techniques. Sensitivity analysis utilizes text mining techniques on text on the Web to extract subjective information in the text for text analysis. Sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the attitudes or positions of the person who wrote the article and presented their opinion about a particular topic.  In this study, we developed a model that selects a hot topic from user posts at Chinas online stock forum by using the k-means algorithm and self-organizing map (SOM). In addition, we developed a detecting model to predict a hot topic by using machine learning techniques such as logit, the decision tree, and SVM. We employed sensitivity analysis to develop our model for the selection and detection of hot topics from China’s online stock forum. The sensitivity analysis calculates a sentimental value from a document based on contrast and classification according to the polarity sentimental dictionary (positive or negative).  The online stock forum was an attractive site because of its information about stock investment. Users post numerous texts about stock movement by analyzing the market according to government policy announcements, market reports, reports from research institutes on the economy, and even rumors. We divided the online forum’s topics into 21 categories to utilize sentiment analysis. One hundred forty-four topics were selected among 21 categories at online forums about stock. The posts were crawled to build a positive and negative text database. We ultimately obtained 21,141 posts on 88 topics by preprocessing the text from March 2013 to February 2015. The interest index was defined to select the hot topics, and the k-means algorithm and SOM presented equivalent results with this data. We developed a decision tree model to detect hot topics with three algorithms: CHAID, CART, and C4.5. The results of CHAID were subpar compared to the others. We also employed SVM to detect the hot topics from negative data. The SVM models were trained with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel function by a grid search to detect the hot topics.  The detection of hot topics by using sentiment analysis provides the latest trends and hot topics in the stock forum for investors so that they no longer need to search the vast amounts of information on the Web. Our proposed model is also helpful to rapidly determine customers’ signals or attitudes towards government policy and firms’ products and services.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

MORAL SUCCESS AND FAILURE IN THE ETHICAL THEORY OF TASAN CHŎNG YAGYONG,2016,"['Moral success', 'moral agency', 'kwŏnhyŏng', 'cogitative mechanism of the spiritual body', 'inference of others’ minds from one’s own']",,"This study analyzes factors associated with moral success and failure in the ethical theory of Chŏng Yagyong (1762–1836), better known as Tasan. According to researchers who emphasize the cognitive and conative role of moral sentiments, moral success is ultimately driven by Tasan’s “moral mind” or “innate moral inclination.” According to them, moral sentiments are not blind, capricious feelings, but are able to intuitively perceive and discern good and evil; only by faithfully following one’s innate inclination toward good, is one well on the road to moral success.Tasan, however, in analyzing criminal acts in Hŭmhŭm sinsŏ (欽欽 新書; A new book on criminal law), notices a curious kind of moral failure caused by a strong moral emotion or passion toward socially endorsed moral virtues such as loyalty, filial piety and fidelity. Without much reflection on one’s inner mind or consideration on the proper method of one’s action, people fall prey to their “moral” emotions and commit crimes like taking revenge on the wrong person or committing suicide for the wrong reason. In his ethical theory, naturally, Tasan emphasizes not only moral sentiments and willpower but also the judging and weighing function of the mind, i.e., the cogitative mechanism of the spirit called kwŏnhyŏng (C. quanheng 權衡), literally meaning weighing and balancing.In this article, I attempt to describe the cogitative function of kwŏnhyŏng as judgment and decision and conclude that it is the actual and essential moral agency in Tasan’s ethical theory. Kwŏnhyŏng estimates and judges the issue at hand by inferring principles (K. ch’uri; C. tuili 推理), which is reminiscent of the rational and intellectual inference in Thomism. Although Tasan’s ethical theory was much influenced by Thomistic tradition, Tasan uniquely interprets “inferring the principle” as “inferring others’ minds from one’s own” (K. ch’usŏ; C. tuishu 推恕), which is a purely Confucian notion distinct from that presumed by Jesuit missionaries.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

An academic university major in cartoons and animation studies established in late 20th century however, did not satisfactorily meet the needs in academic research and development and the free expression of artistic creation was limited. In order to systematize the major in cartoons and animation studies, an convergent approach to establish and clarify following are in demand : the terms and definitions, the historical developments, the research areas and methods, the major education and related jobs and start-ups.  New culture and arts industries including cartoons, animation, moving images, and games contents are not yet listed in the industries listing service jointly provided online by the portal site Naver.com and Hyung-Seol publishing company. Above all, cartoons and animation are inseparably related to each other that even if one uses the term separately and independently, the meaning may not be complete. So a new combined term ""Animatoon"" can be established for the major in cartoons and animation studies and also used for its degree with concentrations of cartoons, animation, moving images, games, and etc.  In the Introduction, a new combined term Animatoon is defined and explained the use of this term as the name of the major and degree in cartoons and animation studies.  In the body, first, the Historical Developments classified Animatoon in the ancient times, the medieval times, and the modern times and they are analyzed with the help of esthetics and arts using examples of mural frescos, animal painting, religion cartoons, caricatures, cartoons, satire cartoons, comics, animation, 2 or 3 dimensional webtoons, and K-toons.  Second, the Research Areas of Animatoon reviewed the theories, genres, artworks, and artists and the Research Methods of Animatoon presented the curriculum that integrated the courses in humanities, science technologies, culture and arts, and etc.  Third, the Major Education considered Animatoon education in children, young adults, students of the major and the Related Jobs and Start-Ups explored various jobs relating to personal creation of artwork and collective production of business-oriented artwork.  In the Conclusion, the current challenges of Animatoon considered personalization of the artists, specialization of the contents, diversification of the types, and liberalization of the art creation. And the direction of improvement advocated Animatoon to be an academic field of study, to be an art, to be a culture, and to be an industry. The importance of cartoons and animation along with videos and games rose in the 21st century.

Seon) master Jewoldang Gyeongheon(霽月堂 敬軒 1544～1633) was a disciple of Cheongheo Hyujeong(淸虛 休靜) who entered the Buddhist priesthood at the age of fifteen and immersed himself in Buddhist practice for 75 years until he died at 91. He was well versed in Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism and was also so thorough about keeping Buddhist commandments that he practiced ‘silence asceticism’ for many years. He distinguished himself at the Imjin War and received a letter of appointment to the governmental office from King Seonjo. However, he refused to take the post and devoted himself on Buddhist practice and edification of his students. He was an exemplary priest who practiced both Zen and Doctrinal (K. Gyo) Buddhism, a practice perception of Joseon Buddhism, and played an important role on establishing the tradition of Buddhist education that is called ‘Enter Zen via Gyo(由敎入禪)’.  After his death, Gyeongheon’s disciples collected the ashes of his body after cremation ceremony and erected a pagoda and stupa. In 1636(the 14th year of King Injo’s reign), his student named Seolhyeon(雪玄) installed, to pay a tribute to Gyeongheon’s charitable deeds, ‘the Epitaph of Grand Master Jewoldang (K. Jewoldangdaesabi)’ in Simwon Temple on Mt. Bogae. Dragons and clouds are engraved beautifully on the head of the stele. The epitaph was composed by Commandant of Dongyang Sin Ikseong and written by King Seonjo’s fourth prince Lord of Uichang Lee Gwang. His epitaph was shipped to Jingpa Port from Hongseong, South Chungcheong Province and then transferred by 5,600 soldiers, monks and people on land. In the following year (the 15th year of King Injo’s reign), his disciples published the Literary Collection of Grand Master Jewoldang (K. Jewoldangdaesajip) as well.  In the early 17th century, it was said that there were three religious traditions of Zen Buddhism in Joseon. The disciples of Gyeongheon, the School of Jewol(霽月派) asserted the religious tradition of Imje-Naong which means that they received the mantle handed down through Naong(懶翁), Younggwan(靈觀), Hyujeong(休靜), and Gyeongheon. Because it was the recognition of one school’s religious tradition by the Buddhist society that determines the status of the school, Buddhists at the time engrossed in establishing the identity and authenticity of their schools via erecting a stone stele and publishing an anthology of their masters. The fact that Gyeongheon’s disciples such as Doil(道一) visited Sin Ikseong, who was renowned as a fine prose writer, several times to ask him to compose the epitaph, erected Jewoldangdaesabi, and compiled Jewoldangdaesajip can be understood as an effort to secure the School of Jewol’s legitimacy by highly praising Gyeongheon’s.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

A total of 145 Buddhist temples, hermitages, and other venues for practicing Buddhism on Jiri Mountain are mentioned in the Beomcheon Chongpyo chapter of the book. Brief sketches of the history of those Buddhist venues found in the chapter are important historical sources for relevant research. These sketches suggest the existence of Buddhist monasteries in the area during the 19th century. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a detailed analysis of the narrating attitude and features of the author and to elucidate the books' Buddhist historical significance and cultural meaning. Five theories of the narrating attitude and features of the author are derived during the course of this analysis. First, simple historical facts of Buddhism on Jiri Mountain are written in an encyclopedic style. Second, most of the entries in the Beomcheon Chongpyo chapter are quoted from records which existed at the time. These include the Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea (K. Sinjeung Dongkuk Yeoji Seungnam), local gazettes, and private literary collections. Third, several quotations are cited without explaining the author's intention or indicating the source of the sentence. Fourth, historic sites that had not been dealt with in the Beomcheon Chongpyo chapter are described in the following chapter titled Gojeokcha. Fifth, the author did not thoroughly review the contents and consequently there are mistakes in the book. Three accounts of the Buddhist historical significance of the book are also derived during the course of analysis. First, it can be regarded as an encyclopedia of Buddhist monasteries on Jiri Mountain during the 19th century. Second, the Confucian scholars' perception of Buddhism at that time is evident in the book. Third, the fact that the first entry of the of the Beomcheon Chongpyo chapter describes the Shrine of the Mountain Spirit (K.

Bhabha) 이론의 좋은 범례다. 김환기는 이미 오래 전에 바바의 이론을 그림을 통해 예시한 셈이다. 그의 그림은 동양과 서양의 사이뿐 아니라 동양주의와 옥시덴탈리즘의 사이를 드러낸다. 이 둘 사이에서 나름의 해결책을 찾아 온 과정을 그의 그림에서 추적할 수 있는 것이다. 그에게 동양주의는 옥시덴탈리즘에 대한 하나의 반응이고 옥시덴탈리즘 또한 동양주의의 다른 얼굴인 셈이다.","The first half (1948-1963) of Kim Whanki’s (1913-1974) artistic career marks the beginning of what is called “Korean Modernism.” For Kim’s work of this period is the idiosyncratic output that brings to light the particular cultural geopolitical location of Korea at that time. That location is revealed via Dongyang-ism, Oxidentalism, and the relation between them. In other words, two different aspects overlap in his art: the will to continue the identity of traditional culture and the demand for the reception of the mainstream art from the West which led modernization. This is fully demonstrated through his use of subjects and forms. To elaborate, his art can be characterized by the coexistence of the signs of identity such as traditional crafts and nature and those of modernity including modernist and artificial forms. And as for formal aspect, it is defined by the mutual compatibility among figurative images and abstract composition, geometric structure and spontaneous brushworks and textures. That is, Kim’s painting is an index of the cultural geopolitical location of the Third-World painters who were simultaneously exposed both to their own traditional cultures and the artistic practices prevailed in developed countries. While encompassing different elements, his painting also reveals the principle of “inclusion”, which differs from dichotomic logic of the Western modernity. In the respect that this is rooted in the cultural traditions of Eastern Asia, Kim’s art is a paragon of the active acceptance of other cultures-that is the reinterpretation of foreign cultures through the filter of one’s own tradition. Showing differences and the relationships between them, his paintings become paradigmatic examples of Homi K. Bhabha’s theoretical formulation, which locates the meaning of culture in “the third space”, namely in “the in-between”, and thereby underlines the hybridity of culture. It is fair to say that Kim’s pictorial endeavors already illustrated Bhabha’s theory long ago. His paintings articulate “the in-between” of Dongyang-ism and Oxidentalism as well as that of the East and the West. One can trace in his paintings the process of his search for solutions in that “in-between” space as Kim Whanki Dongyang-ism is a response to Oxidentalism and the latter is the other side of the former.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

It refers not only to refined writing in Literary Chinese, but also to more utilitarian public and private writings in Literary Chinese composed in the context of daily life. Thus, “Sino-Korean literature” includes not only literary writings but also historical records, scholarly essays, public documents such as diplomatic correspondence, and private texts such as correspondence in Literary Chinese. Works in Literary Chinese with interspersed vernacular expressions as well as works using Chinese characters phonetically to inscribe the Korean language. Korean literary Chinse prose includes all forms of prose of narrative genre except novel and its main stream is ancient-style prose (古文). However, from the early stage of Korean history of literature, Koreanstyle Chinese (including “clerical reading” [吏讀]) and parallel prose (四六文) developed in addition to literary Chinese namely ancient-style prose, and it was since mid Koryeo period that ancient-style prose has been mainstreamed. In late Joseon literati developed literary Chinese prose appropriating classicist prose based on Qin and Han models (秦漢古文, 擬古文) and essays (小品). Studies of literary Chinse prose had been long focused on Park Jiwon`s works until 1980`s when studies on criticism theories on literary Chinse prose, essays in late Joseon, classicist prose based on Qin and Han models, main ideas of literary Chinse prose, historical changes of criticism and its methodology etc. began to be paid attention. In the Joseon Dynasty the majority of authors belonged to the yangban elite : accordingly, their literary works focused on supporting the successful governance of the dynasty (經國文章). However, In the late Joseon Dynasty, as the hierarchy of Confucian scholars diversified, poor scholars who shared living space with the middle and lower classes of society created their own new literary world that they found a deeper meaning to his literary activities in a daily life where scholars and ordinary people coexisted in harmony. Late Joseon literati were also affected by Yuan Hongdao`s that they emphasized the immediacy of true feelings in literary expression.

The research subjects for the quantitative analysis were 56 gifted children with ADHD, those with an IQ of 125 or higher amongst children who were diagnosed with ADHD and the 56 mothers of these children. In order to supplement the results of quantitative research, qualitative research was held through in-depth interviews with eight of the mothers of the gifted children with ADHD.First, the factor analysis shows that gifted children with ADHD showed significantly higher performance in verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, freedom from distractibility, processing speed indexes amongst the K-WISC-Ⅲ. However, they didn’t show significant differences in shape pairing tests. This suggests that gifted children with ADHD lacks alacrity, spontaneity, cognitive flexibility, and show consistent effort in ambiguous contexts.Second, in the subdivision of creativity, gifted children with ADHD showed significantly higher performance in fluency, elaboration, abstractness of title, and resistance to premature closure. However, they did not show significant differences in originality. The intellectual capacity of gifted children with ADHD were rather discouraged connection to new methods. Furthermore, the criterion of counting the number of responses within a given time period has affected the originality of the gifted children with ADHD who tend to show in-depth attention to their interest.Third, gifted children with ADHD showed dominant attention deficit. Furthermore, this suggests a possibility of this problem not being recognized by parents or teachers in comparison to those ordinary children with ADHD who externalize this problem.Fourth, in comparison to ordinary children with ADHD, gifted children with ADHD showed significantly higher anxiety, depression, and delinquency. This means gifted children with ADHD experience difficulty in conducting emotional behaviour.Fifth, there were no significant differences in the result of quantitative research in parenting efficacy between mothers of ordinary children with ADHD and mothers of gifted children with ADHD, and it was also confirmed that mothers of gifted children with ADHD feel difficulties in parenting as well. The reasoning was analyzed by qualitative research methods and the results are as follows: mothers of gifted children accept and admit the child’s twice exceptionality, then experience misbehavior which leads to the perception that they lack parenting skills and knowledge required to nurture such child.Sixth, quantitative research was carried out on parenting stress i	n mothers of gifted children with ADHD and mothers of ordinary children with ADHD. Results showed that there are significantly higher stress in mothers of gifted children with ADHD related to their child, child’s temperament, and expectation in academics. Qualitative research results also support that mothers of gifted children with ADHD suffers with various types of stress.Seventh, the results of the quantitative research on the attitude in parenting of mothers of gifted children with ADHD and mothers of ordinary children with ADHD show that mothers of gifted children with ADHD have significantly low aggression, hostility, and coercive parenting attitude. Qualitative research showed this positive parenting attitude is derived from the mothers’ effort to appropriately react and fight the stress by understanding and accommodating the child’s twice exceptionality.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Fast all of states encourage and support exporting companies. The large sized company can export by pulling up himself. But the small and medium-sized businesses have problem. Therefore, the nation should support the export of small and medium-sized companies. In this meaning, the small and medium-sized business plus insurance is very important for the export increase of Korea. Korea has grown up through export. The natural resources are in Korea very few. But the man power and educational enthusiasm are very high. The trade insurance is industrial policy insurance. It is done by Korea Trade Insurance Corporation(K-Sure). The small and medium-sized business plus insurance gives the insurance guarantee about importer risk, letter of credit risk, importing nation risk etc. on the payment of premium. The small and medium-sized business plus insurance is distinct from the general Short-term Export Insurance. In the general Short-term Export Insurance, the insurance contract is concluded by each exporting matter. But in the small and medium-sized business plus insurance, the liability limit is settled for the total export trade. The small and medium-sized business plus insurance gives insurance guarantee for the company that have over F credit rating of the K-Sure. The small and medium-sized companies that have under 5 million US dollars export result in the last year can get this insurance service. The standard terms of small and medium-sized business plus insurance regulates the duty of disclosure, notice duty on double insurance, subrogation etc like general insurance. But the standard terms of the small and medium-sized business plus insurance is a little bit different from that of general insurance. We should analyse the reason rationally. And when the difference has no rational reason, then the contract terms should be reformed. We should promote the small and medium-sized business plus insurance. Through the wide inflection of this insurance, we can promote export volume, competitive power of small sized companies and the strength of our nation.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The films that are analysed in this research are the following: 〈Sonnenallee〉(1999), 〈Good Bye, Lenin!〉(2003) and 〈The Lives of Others〉(2006). These three films show the prototypical aspects of the East German society, with excellent cinematic quality and high popularity.  These films overturn the widely spread prejudices of the Western world about the East German society rather than recognizing them. 〈Sonnenallee〉 shows the unexpected similarity of values and lifestyle between the young people of the East and West. 〈The Lives of Others〉 alludes to the cherished ideals of socialism in the mind of East German intellectuals even under the rigorously controlled system and severe oppression. Lastly, 〈Good Bye, Lenin!〉 captures the destructive influence of the German reunification on a mediocre East German family, and it questions the historical meaning of the reunification from below.  Furthermore, the three films have the common feature of not ‘demonizing’ the East German society from the perspective of ‘Anti-Communism’. For example, 〈Sonnenallee〉 depicts the East German society as a community of friendship and goodwill, although the virtue has faded away after the reunification. Hence the film evokes ‘ostalgie’, nostalgia for the East. 〈The Lives of Others〉 describes an idealistic socialist in a positive way even under the overwhelming atmosphere of criticism against the Stalinistic oppressive system. In 〈Good Bye, Lenin!〉, the destruction of humanity and socialistic utopia, a result from the rapid capitalization after the reunification, is portrayed from the perspective of irony and melancholy.  In sum, these films can be characterized as ‘a dignified farewell’ to ‘the nation that has once stretched its hands to utopia’(Helga Königsdorf).",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Vernacular has been regarded as the marginal and the lowbrow that could not obtain universality in the confrontational structures between tradition and modernity, between the center and the periphery, and between system and everyday life along with the birth of modern culture.  However, vernacular returned to new elements of design along with the appearance of postmodernism, and furthermore, in the geography of glocalism, attention is paid to that, along with the rise of ‘local culture.’ Yet, this phenomenon does not mean the changed phase of vernacular. It may rather function as a device to restrict and limit the difference, constructing a relativist frame of ‘cultural diversity’.  For this discussion, I applied post-colonial theory as a theoretical background. Especially, Homi K. Bhabha’s concept of ‘cultural difference’ was discussed in comparison with the frame ‘diversity,’ a keyword of post-modern culture, to set up a new phase of the vernacular.  The term, ‘cultural diversity’ contains an ideal ideology that reflects numerous cultures, but it is possible only in the grid that mainstream society or governance culture allows. On the other hand, the ‘cultural difference’ makes the strategy of identification reset by making meanings and values collide, which cannot be combined into one, in the process of cultural understanding and judgment.  In addition, the discussion of the vernacular in the post-modern era was conducted through architectural theorists like Robert Venturi or Hal Foster etc. and studies by design writer Ellen Lupton from a critical position. Through this process, this study would discuss that the vernacular should be reconsidered in our present life escaping from the existing viewpoint.  We can recognize the vernacular as a ‘cultural difference’ inherent in contemporary life, it will be subdivided into something that creates a ‘new gap’ not one of various strategies that solidify the dominant culture, and through such a process, vernacular may act as a cognitive framework by which we can critically think the space or relation of power.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

In the cases whose final diagnosis were autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental language disorder (DLD), we performed this study to investigate the predictive factors of these diseases that can be discriminated in advance in order to provide appropriate early intervention.Methods: From August 2007 to July 2013, 168 patients who visited the NHIS Ilsan Hospital (total 733 patients) more than 2 times were included. All patients visited three departments (Pediatric Neurology, Rehabilitation & Psychiatry) at the same time according to a multidisciplinary approach. Speech evaluation, development & IQ test, social and emotional evaluation and hearing test were performed routinely. K-CARS, MRI, EEG, chromosome, and metabolic study were selected according to the patients. Review of medical records of children was performed retrospectively. Results: 1) The mean age of children at 1st and follow-up visit was 2.78 years (4-97 months) and 4.81 years (24-136 months) each. The mean follow-up period was 4.81 years (24-136 months). 2) The most common chief complaints of patients was language delay (71.5%). 3) The difference between the tentative diagnosis and the final diagnosis was mainly observed in the GDD and DLD patients. Eventually, the final diagnosis ID was diagnosed more in the GDD than in the DLD (65.3% vs 42.3%), but the diagnosis ASD was diagnosed similarly (16.3 vs 19.2%). 4) Long-term prognosis was better for patients with DLD who has higher nonverbal cognitive developmental quotient (C-DQ >70) at initial visit. 5) Result of the canonical coefficients by discrimination analysis showed that C-DQ (0.7436) was the strongest discriminating factor that predict the three groups, followed by SMS (0.6239), M_Q (0.6070), and eye Contact (0.4743), CARS (-0.3148), Rec_Q (0.2984), and P_Q (0.2629).Conclusion: Regular follow-up of experienced doctor is very important when a patient is delayed. If language delay is prominent compared to other areas & if discriminating factors of ASD are detected, it is advisable to initiate intensive early intervention with long-term periodic follow-up even if it does not meet the diagnostic criteria of ASD with long-term periodic follow-up.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Thus, this paper first aims to translate/interpret Genesis 2:5-6 more correctly through a terminological study on ś￮aḥ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; x;yfi) and 'ēśeḇ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; bf,[e) in verse 5 and 'ēḏ (dae) in verse 6, a close study on the text of Genesis 2:5-6 itself, and an inter-textual interpretation of the text done in association with other related texts. Further, most studies have provided little or no help in understanding the function of Genesis 2:5-6. Therefore, the second goal of this study is to perceive the function that Genesis 2:5-6 has in the broader context, as well as in its immediate context. Keeping these two goals in mind, we proceeded with this research from a synchronic/ literary perspective, paying close attention to the Hebrew text in the BHS (Biblia hebraica stuttgartensia).Taking Genesis 21:15 and Job 30:4, 7, where ś￮aḥ (x;yfi) occurs, into account, even though ś￮aḥ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; x;yfi) in Genesis 2:5 is used only once in the Old Testament, we identified the meaning of ś￮aḥ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; x;yfi) through the parallelisms in Genesis 2:5a and 3:18, and in Genesis 3:17bα-bβ, 18a, and 19aα. We identified the meaning of 'ēśeḇ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; bf,[e) in Genesis 2:5 in relation to Psalm 104:14, first taking into account its usage in Genesis 3:18, Exodus 9:22, 25[2x], and 10:15. Attention was then paid to the significant expression la'abōd 'et-hā'adāmāh (hm'd'a]h'-ta, dbo[]l;), where the Hebrew verb 'ābaḏ (db;[', ""till"") is first used (in Gen 2:5). It appears once more, in 3:23, these two verses being its only occurrences in the Old Testament. In addtion, we took notice of the parallelism which Genesis 3:18, where 'ēśeḇ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; bf,[e) occurs right after 2:5, forms with 3:17b, 19aα. The term 'ēḏ (dae) in Genesis 2:6 occurs once more (in Job 36:27) in the Old Testament, but its translation/interpretation there is nothing but a deduction from its context. Thus, the information for the exact translation/interpretation of 'ēḏ (dae) in Genesis 2:6 seemed to have to be obtained from the predicate which corresponds to 'ēḏ (dae), the subject ofGenesis2:6,andfromcomparativelinguistics. However,theexisting views, based on comparative linguistics, were proven to be unconvincing by Gerhard F. Hasel and Michael G. Hasel, and even the view that they newly highlighted and reinforced is not clearly persuasive. The reason is that they neither meticulously read Genesis 2:6 itself, nor carefully did inter-textual interpretation of it in association with other related texts. The Hebrew verb 'ālāh (hl'[', ""go up""), which is one of the two Hebrew verbs in the predicate of Genesis 2:6, is used for the going up of a well in Numbers 21:17, and the other Hebrew verb ﾚāqāh (hq'v' Hiphil: ""cause to drink water, give to drink"") is also used for the water supply of a spring in Joel 4:18[H 3:18]. A much more decisive fact is that, in the context corresponding to the third day of the Creation week in the so-called ""Creation epic"" (Ps 104), God's activity separating the dry land from the waters and the situation in which the separation is completely done is vividly portrayed in verses 9-10 (ESV): ""You [God] set a boundary that they [the waters] may not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth. You make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills."" In regard to the text of Genesis 2:5-6 itself, verse 5a is differentiated by the conjunction k￮ (yKi) from verses 5b-6, but verse 6 is a clause which is dominated by the conjunction just as verse 5b is. And it is logically proper to regard the clause of Genesis 2:5b, which starts with the conjunction k￮ (yKi), not as a causal clause but as a tempora...",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

So, The workplace harassment questionnaire for Korean finace and service workers has been developed to assess the level of personal harassment at work. This study aims to develop a tool to assess the level of personal harassment at work and to test its validity and reliability while examining specific characteristics of workplace harassment against finance and service workers in Korea.  Methods: The framework of survey was established based on literature review, focused-group interview for the Korean finance and service workers. To verify its reliability, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was calculated; and to verify its validity, items and factors of the tool were analyzed. The correlation matrix analysis was examined to verify the tool’s convergent validity and discriminant validity. Structural validity was verified by checking statistical significance in relation to the BDI-K.  Results: Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of this survey was 0.93, which indicates a quite high level of reliability. To verify the appropriateness of this survey tool, its construct validity was examined through factor analysis. As a result of the factor analysis, 3 factors were extracted, explaining 56.5 % of the total variance. The loading values and communalities of the 20 items were 0.85 to 0.48 and 0.71 to 0.46. The convergent validity and discriminant validity were analyzed and rate of item discriminant validity was 100 %. Finally, for the concurrent validity, We examined the relationship between the WHI-KFSW and pschosocial stress by examining the correlation with the BDI-K. The results of chi-square test and multiple logistic analysis indicated that the correlation with the BDI-K was satatisctically significant.

Depending on the aspects, the central subspace, the central mean subspace and the central $k^{th}$-moment subspace are defined and investigated as primary interests. Then the relationships among the three subspaces and the changes in the three subspaces for non-singular transformation of ${\mathbf{X}}$ are studied. We discuss the two conditions to guarantee the existence of the three subspaces that constrain the marginal distribution of ${\mathbf{X}}$ and the conditional distribution of $Y{\mid}{\mathbf{X}}$.

Though these two concepts seem to be obviously uncompatible, the Ratnagotravibhāga tries to bridge these concepts. In order to investigate the relationship, I have focussed on three points: Firstly, as the prerequisite for understanding the meanings of Tathāgatagarbha in the Ratnagotravibhāga, it is necessary to realize that there are two aspects of Tathāgatagarbha: one relating with the causal level and the other with fruit-level. I discuss these two aspects with regard the three meaning of Tathāgatagarbha.Secondly, Ratnagotravibhāga deals with the description of the hindrances for three kinds of practitioners. theses hindrances, which were produced on the basis of the ignorance of the nature of the Tathāgatagarbha, is to be eliminated through the realization of the emptiness. It is highly interesting in this context that Ratnagotravibhāga uses very similar terms with the Yogācāra texts.Thirdly, the terminological similarity should be noticed, if we want to investigate the reason why Ratnagotravibhāga departs from the Yogācāra texts. For this purpose, I compare the explanation of the Ratnagotravibhāga with that of the Madhyāntavibhāga-Bhāṣya of Vasubandhu and the Madhyāntaṭīkā of Sthiramati. The points dealt with are: (1) the reason for the distinction of the emptiness in the state of samala and nirmala. (2) the meaning of the emptiness in the state of samala and nirmala. (3) the meaning of unchangeability of the emptiness.By comparing the Ratnagotravibhāga with the Yogācāra texts, I am intending to show the departing points of the Yogācāra interpretation from the Ratnagotravibhāga which represents the Tathāgatagarbha school in India.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The object of study is Chinese and Korean “頭” related Chinese and Korean “頭” idioms and other forms of expression are beyond the scope of this paper. “頭” related words are the most frequently used vocabulary in both Modern Chinese and Modern Korean. Meanwhile, “頭” occupies a very important position in the human and animal body and also associated with the life and death problem of a survival. Human beings rely on “頭” to think and then get known about the world. So, it is of great importance to take semantic research on human terms “頭” related words. Semantics is the result of taking the overall perception of things, is an empirical abstract mental map, it may involve taking a variety of features, some of which feature living in the foreground, which are prototypical; other features in background-position, which are marginal. Cognitive linguistics called ‘figure’ and ‘ground’. With combined theories of cognitive linguistics and comparative linguistics, this paper mainly analyzed Chinese and Korean “頭” related words in respective language system semantic evolution. And also, “structural justice” and “righteousness features” comparative analysis is given on this basis of two semantic aspects for Chinese and Korean “頭” related words. The “structural connection” is the location of the “頭” itself and the “頭” revealed on the human oranimal body, in other words, the combination of “appearance” and “location”.

For that reason, financial regulatory authorities have built the strongest and the most severe chinese walls between both businesses for the purpose of protecting the interest of customers only, which could be rarely found in other financially advanced countries. Traditionally, other countries have emphasized on the importance of a principle in the financial sector and put the chinese walls generally under self regulations, so called ``principle-based regulations``, rather than under the mandatory statutes and regulations, so called ``rule-based regulations``. Surprisingly, Japan introduced the mandatory regime in regulating conducts of businesses when it enacted the Financial Products Transaction Act of 2006, and Korea followed a same direction in enacting the Capital Market Act. Two years later in 2008, however, Japan fundamentally changed its rule-based regulation system to a principle-based regulation system. This means that Korea is the only rule-based regulation country among financially advanced countries. This paper analyzes deeply the British self regulatory regime in the conduct of a financial business area which has been admired as the most idealistic principle-based regulation system in terms of chinese wall regulations by all over the world, which will be sure to suggest the future reform of the Capital Market Act in Korea. Originally, chinese wall regulations were designed to block the delivery of non-public material information. However, after the firm establishment of the mandatory insider regulation system, chinese wall regulations have focused on the importance of a self-ruling and internal control system.

This paper proposes a dynamic task distribution on clustered data centers. A proportional VM migration approach is also proposed, where it migrates virtual machines to the cloud servers proportionally according to their allocated CPU, in order to prevent overloading of resources in servers. Moreover, we included the resource capacity of each data center in terms of the maximum CPU in order to improve the migration approach in cloud servers.

Consequently, women s social and legal status are elevated, but the child’s status in the law gets no better. I think it is because parents have thought them as their possessions. They say that their thought are influenced by the Confucianism. I can not go along with them. To be influenced by the Confucian culture means, I believe, that there is an order of rank based on respect and benevolence not a command and subordination between parents and children. There were days when children were possessions of their parents in U.K. For the materials are from the Blackstone’s work, the author called that time as ‘Blackstone’s age’. Furthermore, As maternal rights are liberated from the father’s, the child’s status grew strong together. And finally, the child’s status established by the Child Act 1989. In this paper, the author described parental rights, maternal rights and child’s rights in common law and equity. And interpreted several cases and finally examined the Gillick case.

We developed warfarin algorithm for Korean patients with stroke and compared the accuracy of warfarin dose prediction algorithms based on the pharmacogenetics.Materials and Methods: A total of 101 patients on stable maintenance dose of warfarin were enrolled. Warfarin dosing algorithm was developed using multiple linear regression analysis. The performance of all the algorithms was characterized with coefficient of determination, determined by linear regression, and the mean of percent deviation was used to predict doses from the actual dose. In addition, we compared the performance of the algorithms using percentage of predicted dose falling within ±20% of clinicallyobserved doses and dividing the patients into a low-dose group (≤3 mg/day), an intermediate-dose group (3–7 mg/day), and high-dose group (≥7 mg/day).Results: A new developed algorithms including the variables of age, body weight, and CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype. Our algorithmaccounted for 51% of variation in the warfarin stable dose, and performed best in predicting dose within 20% of actual dose and intermediate-dose group.Conclusion: Our warfarin dosing algorithm may be useful for Korean patients with stroke.

Owing to the difficulty of extracting RNA from sputum containing mucus, sputum homogenization is desirable prior to nucleic acid isolation. We determined optimal homogenization methods for isolating viral nucleic acids from sputum.Methods: We evaluated the following three sputum-homogenization methods: proteinase K and DNase I (PK-DNase) treatment, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine and sodium citrate (NALC) treatment. Sputum samples were spiked with inactivated MERS-CoV culture isolates. RNA was extracted from pretreated, spiked samples using the easyMAG system (bioMérieux, France). Extracted RNAs were then subjected to rRT-PCR for MERS-CoV diagnosis (DiaPlex Q MERS-coronavirus, SolGent, Korea).Results: While analyzing 15 spiked sputum samples prepared in technical duplicate, false-negative results were obtained with five (16.7%) and four samples (13.3%), respectively, by using the PBS and NALC methods. The range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed when detecting upE in sputum samples was 31.1-35.4 with the PK-DNase method, 34.7-39.0 with the PBS method, and 33.9-38.6 with the NALC method. Compared with the control, which were prepared by adding a one-tenth volume of 1:1,000 diluted viral culture to PBS solution, the ranges of Ct values obtained by the PBS and NALC methods differed significantly from the mean control Ct of 33.2 (both P<0.0001).Conclusions: The PK-DNase method is suitable for homogenizing sputum samples prior to RNA extraction.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The result indicated that the prepared Cu-Zr-Ti-Ni alloys were bulk glassy alloys. The temperature interval of supercooled liquid region (${\Delta}T_x$) was about 45.48 to 70.98 K for the Cu-Zr-Ti-Ni alloy. The Vickers hardness was up to 565 HV for the $Cu_{50}Zr_{25}Ti_{15}Ni_{10}$ bulk glassy alloy. The $Cu_{50}Zr_{25}Ti_{15}Ni_{10}$ bulk glassy alloys were annealed in order to obtain nanocrystals. The results showed that the Vickers hardness was raise up to 630 HV from 565 HV. As shown in XRD results, the amorphous alloys changed to nanocrystals, which were $Cu_8Zr_3$, $Cu_3Ti_2$ and CuZr, improved the hardness. The SEM analysis showed that the compression fractured morphology of amorphous alloys was brittle fracture, and the fracture morphology after annealing was ductile fracture. This proved that annealing of amorphous to nanocrystals can improve the plasticity and toughness of amorphous alloys.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
Opportunistic Function Computation for Wireless Sensor Networks,2016,"['wireless sensor networks', 'In-network computation', 'fading channels', 'lattice codes', 'opportunistic communication', 'power adaptation']",,"<P>Function computation over wireless sensor networks is investigated, where a set of K sensors observe their sensor readings and a fusion center wishes to learn a predefined function of the sensor readings via fading multiple access channels (MACs). In this paper, the arithmetic sum and type functions are considered since they can yield various fundamental sample statistics such as mean, variance, maximum, and minimum. We propose a novel opportunistic in-network computation (INC) framework in which a subset of sensors with large channel gains opportunistically participate in the transmission at each time, while all sensors simultaneously send their observations or only a single sensor sends its observation in the conventional schemes. We mathematically analyze the long-term average computation rate of the proposed INC, and prove that it achieves a nonvanishing computation rate even when the number of sensors K tends to infinity, which is in fact a significant improvement and the first theoretical result in fading MACs. Note that the computation rates of the conventional schemes become zero as K increases. We further show that a similar multiuser diversity gain is still achievable under delay constraints, which implies that the proposed INC is restricted to exploit a fixed and finite number of time slots (or fading instances) for the function computation.</P>",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

This study focused on the analysis of 32 regions on its characteristics of local climate change adaptation plans. First, statistic program R was used for conducting cluster analysis based on the frequency and budgets of adaptation plan. Further, we analyzed damage frequency from newspapers regarding climate change impacts in eight categories which were caused by extreme weather events on 2,565 cases for 24 years. Lastly, the characteristics of climate change adaptation plan was compared with damage frequency patterns for evaluating the adequacy of climate change adaptation plan on each cluster.Four different clusters were created by cluster analysis. Most clusters clearly have their own characteristics on certain sectors. There was a high frequency of damage in ‘disaster’ and ‘health’ sectors. Climate change adaptation plan and budget also invested a lot on those sectors. However, when comparing the relative rate among regional governments, there was a difference between types of damage and climate change adaptation plan. We assumed that the difference could come from that each region established their adaptation plans based on not only the frequency of damage, but vulnerability assessment, and expert opinions as well. The result of study could contribute to policy making of climate change adaptation plan.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

As objects of this study, The terms are ‘ohirjə(오히려)’, ‘mahurɛgi dance(마후래기 춤)’, ‘tsane(자네)’, ‘k’ɨrida(끄리다)’, and ‘s’ɨida(쓰이다)’, and in the syntactic structures there are the genitive particle ‘e(에)’, the conjunctive-ending element ‘-mdza(-ㅁ자)’, and unique coherent structures.In Midang's poem, “Seonunsa Temple Valley Entrance(선운사 동구)”, ‘ohirjə(오히려)’ is often replaced by other poetic words such as ‘adzikto(아직도)’, ‘sibangdo(시방도)’, and ‘saɧgido(상기도)’. This has embarrassed many Korean literary researchers, but in fact, ‘ohirjə(오히려)’ used in Midang's poetry is a synonym for ‘adzikto(아직도)’. This fact can be distinctively confirmed in not only many historical data of Korean language but also Midang's other works(poetry & prose). For ‘mahurɛgi dance(마후래기 춤)’, it is reasonable to assume that the dance refers to a hat dance or a head shaking dance, diverging from ‘tshəjong dance(처용무)’. The third person pronoun ‘tsane(자네)’ is often found as an honorific expression in his poems. And this can be accessed to used as fairly conservative usage in aspect of the history of Korean. In addition, while ‘k’ɨrida(끄리다)’, the advanced verb form of ‘pskɨrida(리다)’, is seen to mean [bear], ‘s’ɨida(쓰이다)’ is [persist].In Midang's poetry, the specific genitive particle ‘e(에)’ is frequently used in the place of common genitive particle ‘ɨj(의)’. The particle ‘e’(에) seems to derive from locative particles ‘et/ɛt(엣/앳)’ of Middle Korean or‎Modern Korean. In this respect, this paper suggests an appropriate method for interpreting ‘tshoronge bulpit(초롱에 불빛)’ which is one of most controversial poetic terms in Midang’s famous poem “Kwitshokto(귀촉도)”. The conjunctive-ending element ‘-mdza(-ㅁ자)’, having the meaning of [appointment], is thought as a combination of ‘-m-(-ㅁ-)’ and ‘-dza(-자)’ which refers to [speaker's desire]. Finally, as unique syntactic structures of “Getting dark twilight(저무는 황혼)” are analysed from the aspect of Korean linguistics, the accurate interpretive method is suggested.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
Tunable thermoelectric transport properties of Cu0.008Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 via control of the spark plasma sintering conditions,2016,,,"<P>Polycrystalline bulks of n-type Cu0.008Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 were prepared to investigate the controllability of its thermoelectric transport properties by using the compaction conditions of spark plasma sintering (SPS). The 00l crystal orientation to the press direction of the SPSed bulks was easily improved by increasing the applied pressure at 500 A degrees C. The thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT values (0.72 - 0.75 at 300 K), of all samples were almost the same, however, both the electronic and the thermal transport properties could be tuned significantly by adjusting the sintering pressure. This result highlights the feasibility of using pressure-induced sintering as a fabrication technology for Bi2Te3-based polycrystalline bulks with high mechanical reliability, which is an effective means of optimizing the electrical and the thermal conductivities for maximizing the efficiencies of the thermoelectric cooling and the power generation modules.</P>",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

When the data from Contemporary Korean dialects and the sixteenth-century written documents is carefully examined, however, the cause and mechanism of the phenomenon can be interpreted in a different way. The restoration is not sufficiently explained by the single cause, i.e. elimination of allomorphs, which applies only to connective endings, such as -kwo and -key, since the reintroduction of /k/ in comitative particle -kwa has to be understood as an unification of its alternating condition with that of other case and auxiliary particles. The mechanism of the change is basically analogy, but a possibility of dialect borrowing needs to be taken into account as well. The high percentage of /k/ occurrence in its lenition environments in the sixteenth-century local publications does not mean that the phoneme has actually returned, but that the original /k/ just still remains in those dialects. This fact implies that at least some of the /k/-restored forms even in the publications by central government are the result of borrowing from other dialects.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

For this purpose, the U.S. enacted the Federal level regulation, such as The Dodd-Frank Act, and the U.K. reorganized its financial regulatory system focusing on the FCA and PRA. Both countries, commonly, strengthened the fit-and-proper test for the controlling shareholder and the management members.Under the Korean regulatory scheme, the test has been already adopted at the Bank company and Bank holding company. However, other financial institutions, such as Insurance company, Securities company and Credit Card company has been free from the fit-and-proper test for their controlling shareholder.

Fandom studies usually focus on “K-Pop Idol” fandom, because idol fandom is well known, big-sized and well-organized, and it holds a large consumer market in the culture industries. However, the fandom of Korean youth cannot be confined to idol fandom. The areas of interest of fans are various, including comics, movies, indie music, novels, history (and historical dramas), sports, internet games, and more. As the informants of this study grew up alongside the development of the internet and information media, and they are used to popular culture and its fandom. We can say that fandom is their conventional activity. There are some characteristics in Korean youth fandom. Although cultural details are different from one genre to another, consuming “cultural goods” is very important in the fan`s world. Cultural goods in fandom includes more than only the official products like music CDs, T-shirts or listening to music repeatedly via internet streaming service, but also secondary products produced by fan themselves which include fan-fic (fan fiction), illustrations, photos taken by themselves, key-rings, self-made figures, and more. To consume these goods means to show one`s own identity as a fan, and they think they can have true membership through consuming the goods. To get some information about their favorites and to communicate with each other, fans are using various media platforms. One of the most useful communicating platforms is Twitter. Fandom means some kind of taste. However, sometimes some fans try to hide their own taste for fandom. For example, idol fandom is treated as vulgar or shallow-brained. In addition, some women who are fans of sports like baseball, football and e-sports are viewed as if they are merely looking for handsome guys. Another such case is that it is not considered appropriate in Korea to prefer Japanese animations or comics. Hence, there is a“hierarchy of taste.” In this hierarchy, some fans who do not want to be evaluated through their own taste try to conceal the fact that they are fans of a specific genre.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The urban heat island intensity (UHII) is the actual temperature difference between the urban area and the rural area.

The UHII in Ulsan and Deajeon is significant so it should be taken into account in the design especially for warm summer nights when the city centre temperature could be up to 8K higher than the rural area. The UHII is not so significant in the daytime as at night, contrary to the common conception that it occurs during the day. At present the weather data currently used by designers is invariably derived from meteorological measurements taken at semi-rural sites often at airfields, away from urban center.

The study focuse on the rituals performed by Lee after his mother's death, his participation in the funeral, and his mourning specifically as an individual who has lost his parent. Reviewing Lee’s mourning life beside the grave, the contents of diary belonging to a nobleman in the middle of Joseon Dynasty were studied aimsing to find out the meaning of rituals, the overall recognition accorded to death, and the filial duties that were carried out by the noblemen of the time.Although noblemen in the middle of Joseon Dynasty ceaselessly attempted to change the observance of funeral rituals through legislation, it was difficult to change the mindset of the people, who fllowed the deep-rooted traditions of long history. It must be acknowledged that the Joseon Dynasty had a different cultural background than that of China. There was a fundamental problem when they tried to adapt The Family Rituals of Zhu Xi, followed by the Chinese, to the Joseon society. Although The Family Rituals of Zhu Xi emphasized ancestral rites focusing on enshrining mortuary tablets and the importance of establishing the family shrine hundred times, noblemen in the mid-Joseon Dynasty period cared for their parents in the grave by mourning for them than by following such practice. The solemn memorial service held in front of the grave, and the annual ritual service on the death anniversary were far more important to the noblemen in the mid-Joseon Dynasty. Amid such contradictions, the noblemen accepted and performed the mourning rituals beside the grave of their parent.Human beings across the ages have always dwelt upon thoughts of the afterlife. Most people believe that they attain a state after the death of their physicalbody. If humans did not have such thoughts, they would not be bothered if death occurs on being hit by a car on the street. Thus, human beings often think of the ritual services related to death, although in different forms. Therefore, mourning by the grave of their parent held great significance among the noblemen of the Joseon Dynasty as a sign of their filial piety.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Originally, the name of the castle had been written as Tanghang Castle(Tanghang sŏng ; 唐項城). in Chinese characters, meaning a “castle on the road to Tang.” Silla organized Namyang region into Tangsŏng county(唐城郡), with Tanghang Castle as the capital city of the county. The name of the county, Tangsŏng(唐城), came from the Tanghang Castle, omitting the word “hang(項)” from Tanghang Castle(唐項城).Later, Silla changed Chinese characters of the name from Tanghang sŏng(唐項城) to Tanghang sŏng(党項城) in the second year of King Sŏndŏk(善德王). The new Chinese characters for the castle, Tanghang(党項), referred to Tangut(党項), an ethnic group in the west frontier of the Tang Dynasty. Silla’s intention to change the name was to congratulate the Emperor of Tang on Tangut’s submission to his rule. It was a desperate diplomatic measure of King Sŏndŏk, who was embroiled in controversy about her legitimacy of succession because of her gender; the king attempted to conciliate Emperor Taizong(太宗), who had boycotted installation of King Sŏndŏk, and ultimately pacify the opposition in the political sphere of Silla.During the period of the unification war in the 7th century, Tanghang Castle consistently played a critical role as a gateway to the Tang Dynasty from Silla. Yet after the end of the war, Silla reorganized the system of regional governments on a nationwide scale during the reign of King Sinmun(神文王). In this process, the capital city of Tangsŏng county transferred to flatland, and evidently Tanghang Castle lost its status as a capital city, and role as a gateway to the Tang Dynasty.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

According to the empirical results of probit analysis, the coefficients of female managers are not statistically significant of the continued working hours in the previous job. It means that job experience of previous employments is not working for female managers at their current job. On the other hand, the possibility of job turnover with the similar job continuity depends on marital status and with or without children. This possibility is lower when they are married and with children. Next, the estimations of earnings depending on the similar job continuity show that female managers who keep the similar job continuity have about 12 percent higher earnings than female managers who don’t keep it. However, the job satisfaction of female managers who keep the similar job continuity is 0.3 point lower than female managers who don’t keep it. This study shows that the composition of human capital in terms of job experience for the female managers is restricted. Their workplace environment may not be friendly to the female managers although the job continuity keeps. Therefore, the female employment policy needs to be considered that it should be creating a family friendly workplace with the job continuity.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

VLF (Very Low Frequency) was stable when the HRV was higher than that of targets. The HRV was higher under eyes-closed condition than under eyes-open condition. With regard to body temperature control, vasomotion and hormone, a direct light projection method was stable under eyes-closed condition.

Originally, the name of the castle hadbeen written as Tanghang Castle(Tanghang sŏng ; 唐項城). in Chinese characters, meaning a “castleon the road to Tang.” Silla organized Namyang region into Tangsŏng county(唐城郡), with TanghangCastle as the capital city of the county. The name of the county, Tangsŏng(唐城), came from theTanghang Castle, omitting the word “hang(項)” from Tanghang Castle(唐項城).Later, Silla changed Chinese characters of the name from Tanghang sŏng(唐項城) to Tanghangsŏng(党項城) in the second year of King Sŏndŏk(善德王). The new Chinese characters for the castle,Tanghang(党項), referred to Tangut(党項), an ethnic group in the west frontier of the Tang Dynasty.Silla’s intention to change the name was to congratulate the Emperor of Tang on Tangut’s submissionto his rule. It was a desperate diplomatic measure of King Sŏndŏk, who was embroiled in controversyabout her legitimacy of succession because of her gender; the king attempted to conciliate EmperorTaizong(太宗), who had boycotted installation of King Sŏndŏk, and ultimately pacify the oppositionin the political sphere of Silla.During the period of the unification war in the 7th century, Tanghang Castle consistently playeda critical role as a gateway to the Tang Dynasty from Silla. Yet after the end of the war, Silla reorganizedthe system of regional governments on a nationwide scale during the reign of King Sinmun(神文王).In this process, the capital city of Tangsŏng county transferred to flatland, and evidently TanghangCastle lost its status as a capital city, and role as a gateway to the Tang Dynasty.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The bases of value-added tax include the receipt of pecuniary and non-pecuniary payments, but not discounts. Under the points system, which is used as a means to facilitate transactions for suppliers, customers are allotted points corresponding to a set rate of the purchase amount whenever they engage in a primary transaction to purchase goods and services, which is redeemable for discounts in a secondary transaction with the same supplier based on their accumulated points. Although not at issue in this case, the Court first determined that, in a points system involving a single supplier, only the money actually received from its customers in secondary transactions is included in tax base, to the exclusion of that part of the account settled by points, which constitutes a discount. This seems to be in accord with tax practices in Japan and the U.K. Meanwhile, there are cases in which multiple suppliers are pooled into a points system and customers are allowed to redeem the accumulated points at any store of those suppliers subscribed to the points system. The question presented in this case involves such a circumstance, where the suppliers settle accounts based on the points redeemed in secondary transactions. The Court held that in such a case as well, only the money actually received from the customer in secondary transactions is included in tax base, while the account settled by points constitutes a discount.The significance of the case is that, in determining the nature of reward points widely adopted in general consumption practices and their treatment under the Value-Added Tax Act, the Court explained in detail the legal doctrine on discounts, one of the most controversial issues involving the scope of tax base under the Value-Added Tax Act, while reaffirming the meaning of the no taxation without representation principle under the Constitution, by applying a limited interpretation to the enforcement decree provision, of which the mandatory basis in the mother-law is vague at best.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Then, efforts were made to heal the surface defects using additional EB-PVD with ion beam bombardment and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The EB-PVD did not effectively heal the cracks. But, the CVD was more appropriate for crack healing, likely due to its excellent crack line filling capability with a high density and high aspect ratio. It took~34min for the 20% weight loss of the CVD crack healed sample in the oxidation test with annealing at 1173K, while it took~8min for the EB-PVD coated sample, which means it took ~4 times longer at 1173K for the same weight reduction in this experimental set-up.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Meanwhile, the typical screens which function as physical containers of these contents, TVs and computer monitors for instance, are occupying dominant positions in our everyday life spaces: our homes, offices, public places, etc. Screens have currently become the main channels for watching television, enjoying movies, working, and receiving information. As technology advances further, the figures of screens are becoming larger and slimmer, loosening spatial restrictions. Also, the quality is evolving, where Ultra High Definition 4K and even 8K resolutions are currently being demonstrated.This paper is a study on the aesthetic nature of Ambient Video art which is produced to create spatial atmosphere and visual pleasure through digital screens that have settled into our everyday life spaces, such as television, computer monitors, and wall monitors. Ambient Video can be considered as (moving) video paintings that achieves the very role framed pictures carry out. It is a form of new-media, enabled by the development of computer graphics technology like digital compositing and special effects, requiring distinguished features compared from conventional idioms of original video mediums.The purpose of Ambient Video, the main subject of this paper, is emotional communication. Ambient Video values slow forms and depictive expression and does not seek for conventional video expressions with linear narrative structures like those in movies or television programs which tend to draw substantial attention from the viewers, nor does it depend on temporal montage to generate fictional reality. Ambient Video pursues a new kind of aesthetics featuring natural compositions, modifications, and continuity via the improvements of digital compositing techniques.

The major factors that contribute to soil salinity are the quality, the amount and the type of irrigation water used. The presented review discusses the different sources and causes of soil salinity. The effect of soil salinity on biological processes of plants is also discussed in detail. This is followed by a debate on the influence of salt on the nutrient uptake and growth of plants. Salinity decreases the soil osmotic potential and hinders water uptake by the plants. Soil salinity affects the plants K uptake, which plays a critical role in plant metabolism due to the high concentration of soluble sodium (Na<SUP>+</SUP>) ions. Visual symptoms that appear in the plants as a result of salinity include stunted plant growth, marginal leaf necrosis and fruit distortions. Different strategies to ameliorate salt stress globally include breeding of salt tolerant cultivars, irrigation to leach excessive salt to improve soil physical and chemical properties. As part of an ecofriendly means to alleviate salt stress and an increasing considerable attention on this area, the review then focuses on the different plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) mediated mechanisms with a special emphasis on ACC deaminase producing bacteria. The various strategies adopted by PGPB to alleviate various stresses in plants include the production of different osmolytes, stress related phytohormones and production of molecules related to stress signaling such as bacterial 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate(ACC) derivatives. The use of PGPB with ACC deaminase producing trait could be effective in promoting plant growth in agricultural areas affected by different stresses including salt stress. Finally, the review ends with a discussion on the various PGPB activities and the potentiality of facultative halophilic/halotolerant PGPB in alleviating salt stress.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

To solve this problem, the LST retrieval algorithm (CSW_v2.0) was updated using the simulation results of radiative transfer model (MODTRAN 4.0) by considering the diurnal variations of air temperature. In general, the upgraded version, CSW_v3.0 showed a similar correlation coefficient between the prescribed LSTs and retrieved LSTs (0.99), the relatively smaller bias (from -0.03 K to-0.012 K) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (from 1.39 K to 1.138 K).

Long-term (1/1/2011~12/31/2011) monitoring data, which consists of 10-min interval streamflow and the amount of precipitation, were collected at the domestic study area (1.36 km2 located in H county), and used for the construction of the RDII prediction models. The RTK method employs super position of tri-triangles, and each triangle (called, unit hydrograph) is defined by three parameters (i.e., R, T and K) determined/optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA). In regression method, the MovingAverage (MA) filtering was used for data processing. Accuracies of RDII predictions from these two approaches were evaluated by comparing the root mean square error (RMSE) values from each model, in which the values were calculated to 320.613 (RTK method) and 420.653 (regression method), respectively.

The origin and forming processes of the samples are not clear in this stage as limited number of evidences can be found. However it is suggested that the samples are not aeolian deposits originated from chinese loess by the chemical analysis. The mean diameter of samples were 5~6φ(silt) and are increased slightly downwards. The samples also well sorted. The samples have been heavily weathered by the chemical alteration index. The value of CIA increase downward rapidly at the upper part of outcrop, then stabilized afterwards. The vertical concentration changes ratio of cations varies; Si increases downwards while Fe, Ti, K and Mg decrease. There are fluctuation in concentration ratio of Na and Ca with increasing depth. The burial age of sample from upper part are estimated as 104.52±4.45ka BP, while that of lower part are 136.10±6.52ka BP, and they fall in to last part of MS6.

Block Tearing and Local Buckling of Aluminum Alloy Gusset Joint Plates,2016,"['aluminum alloy gusset joint', 'resistance', 'block tearing', 'local buckling', 'theoretical formulae', 'design criteria']",,"Aluminum Alloy Gusset (AAG) joints widely used in the single-layer latticed shells have a significant application prospect in spatial structures. Unfortunately, studies on the resistance of AAG joints are insufficient, leading to a lack of applicative design methods for this joint system. This paper is devoted to investigate the resistance of AAG joint plates. Firstly, tests on fourteen AAG joint specimens are carried out to explore their collapse modes. Experimental phenomena show that the main collapse modes of AAG joint plates include the block tearing of top plates and the local buckling of bottom plates. Secondly, Finite Element (FE) simulations to investigate the mechanical behavior of AAG joints are performed by means of the non-linear FE code ABAQUS. Thirdly, formulae for predicting the block tearing resistance and the local buckling resistance of AAG joint plates are proposed, which are based on theoretical analyses. Fourthly, test results are of great help in the determination of parameters k and α which are adopted to modify the block tearing resistance and the local buckling resistance respectively. Finally, a comparison of test results verifies that theoretical formulae are applicable. In addition, in order to avoid the block tearing and the local buckling of AAG joint plates, convenient design criteria are provided.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
Halotolerant Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria Mediated Salinity Stress Amelioration in Plants,2016,"['Soil salinity', 'Saline', 'Sodic', 'Saline-sodic', 'Plant growth promoting bacteria', '1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)']",,"Soil salinization refers to the buildup of salts in soil to a level toxic to plants. The major factors that contribute to soil salinity are the quality, the amount and the type of irrigation water used. The presented review discusses the different sources and causes of soil salinity. The effect of soil salinity on biological processes of plants is also discussed in detail. This is followed by a debate on the influence of salt on the nutrient uptake and growth of plants. Salinity decreases the soil osmotic potential and hinders water uptake by the plants. Soil salinity affects the plants K uptake, which plays a critical role in plant metabolism due to the high concentration of soluble sodium ($Na^+$) ions. Visual symptoms that appear in the plants as a result of salinity include stunted plant growth, marginal leaf necrosis and fruit distortions. Different strategies to ameliorate salt stress globally include breeding of salt tolerant cultivars, irrigation to leach excessive salt to improve soil physical and chemical properties. As part of an ecofriendly means to alleviate salt stress and an increasing considerable attention on this area, the review then focuses on the different plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) mediated mechanisms with a special emphasis on ACC deaminase producing bacteria. The various strategies adopted by PGPB to alleviate various stresses in plants include the production of different osmolytes, stress related phytohormones and production of molecules related to stress signaling such as bacterial 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) derivatives. The use of PGPB with ACC deaminase producing trait could be effective in promoting plant growth in agricultural areas affected by different stresses including salt stress. Finally, the review ends with a discussion on the various PGPB activities and the potentiality of facultative halophilic/halotolerant PGPB in alleviating salt stress.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Recent studies reported that anemia was associated with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. This study was aimed to analyze the differences of hemoglobin levels in Korean patients with Alzheimer's disease(AD) dementia, mild cognitive impairment(MCI), and healthy controls. Furthermore, the study also examined if any association between hemoglobin levels and cognitive functions existed. Methods : A total of 116 Korean elderly adults were participated in this study(mean age 74.67 years ; 60.3% female). The Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE-K), Clinical Dementia Rating(CDR) and Global Deterioration Scale(GDS) were applied to all subjects. Hematological and related blood chemistry values were investigated. Results : We found that patients with AD dementia had significantly lower hemoglobin and hematocrit levels than MCI subjects and healthy control group. The hemoglobin levels showed a positive correlation with MMSE-K and negative correlation with CDR, GDS. Conclusions : Among Korean elderly, low hemoglobin level is associated with a cognitive impairment. This study indicates that AD is associated with anemia, and low hemoglobin levels may contribute to potentially useful clinical markers of AD.

Soil samples were collected from 190 fields and assessed the effects of management practices on soil chemical properties at wild edible plant fields under no-till system. The strong acidic soils of pH 5.4 or less were detected in 45% of the soil samples. The level of soil organic matter was being held at mean $63{\pm}28g\;kg^{-1}$, 2.7 times higher than upland soils in Korea. Available phosphate and exchangeable potassium showed more than recommended levels of upland crops as $680{\pm}489mg\;kg^{-1}$ and $1.94{\pm}1.7cmol_c\;kg^{-1}$, respectively. The fields of Solidago and Aster showing strong soil acidity and high level of available phosphate and water soluble $NO_3{^-}$ were distinguished from other crops in analysis of variance and principal component analysis of soil chemicals. These results suggested that high frequency of acidic soil and high levels of available $P_2O_5$, exchangeable $K_2O$ and water soluble $NO_3{^-}$ were accompanied with the use of urea and NPK-fertilizer based on nitrogen in the field.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the cross-section transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements indicate that single-phase (001) oriented LCO epitaxial films with biaxial compressive strain and elongated distortion of CoO6 octahedrons were grown on (001) LAO successfully. The epitaxial relationship between the LCO film and the LAO substrate is confirmed to be (001)LCO||(001)LAO and [100]LCO||[100]LAO. It is also found that LCO grown on LAO has a larger mean Co–O bond length and unit-cell size, compared with those of polycrystalline film. In addition, the magnetic characterization shows that LCO epitaxial film exhibits an obvious ferromagnetic (FM) transition at TC ~ 85 K, which is different from the nonmagnetic ground state of polycrystalline LCO. Combined with the structural analyses, it reveals that the strain-induced ferromagnetism observed in LCO epitaxial film originates from an increase of the mean Co–O bond length and a suppression of the CoO6 octahedral rotations, which can stabilize higher spin state of Co3+ by a decrease of the eg~t2g gap energy.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Lossless and lossy compression of quantitative phase images of red blood cells obtained by digital holographic imaging,2016,,,"<P>In this paper, we evaluate lossless and lossy compression techniques to compress quantitative phase images of red blood cells (RBCs) obtained by an off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM). The RBC phase images are numerically reconstructed from their digital holograms and are stored in 16-bit unsigned integer format. In the case of lossless compression, predictive coding of JPEG lossless (JPEG-LS), JPEG2000, and JP3D are evaluated, and compression ratio (CR) and complexity (compression time) are compared against each other. It turns out that JP2k can outperform other methods by having the best CR. In the lossy case, JP2k and JP3D with different CRs are examined. Because some data is lost in a lossy way, the degradation level is measured by comparing different morphological and biochemical parameters of RBC before and after compression. Morphological parameters are volume, surface area, RBC diameter, sphericity index, and the biochemical cell parameter is mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). Experimental results show that JP2k outperforms JP3D not only in terms of mean square error (MSE) when CR increases, but also in compression time in the lossy compression way. In addition, our compression results with both algorithms demonstrate that with high CR values the three-dimensional profile of RBC can be preserved and morphological and biochemical parameters can still be within the range of reported values.

섬광의 적외선 특성 연구,2016,,,"To effectively utilize a flash and predict its effects on an infrared device, it is essential to know the infrared characteristics of the flash source. In this paper, a study of the IR characteristics of flash light sources is carried out. The IR characteristics of three flash sources, of which two are combustive and the other is explosive, are measured with an IR characteristic measurement system over the middle- and long-wavelength infrared ranges. From the measurements, the radiances over the two IR ranges and the radiative temperatures of the flashes are extracted. The IR radiance of flash A is found to be the strongest among the three, followed by those of sources C and B. It is also shown that the IR radiance of flash A is about 10 times stronger than that of flash B, even though these two sources are the same type of flash with the same powder. This means that the IR radiance intensity of a combustive flash source depends only on the amount of powder, not on the characteristics of the powder. From the measured radiance over MWIR and LWIR ranges for each flashes, the radiative temperatures of the flashes are extracted by fitting the measured data to blackbody radiance. The best-fit radiative temperatures (equivalent to black-body temperatures) of the three flash sources A, B, and C are 3300, 1120, and 1640 K respectively. From the radiance measurements and radiative temperatures of the three flash sources, it is shown that a combustive source radiates more IR energy than an explosive one; this mean, in turn, that the effects of a combustive flash on an IR device are more profound than those of an explosive flash source. The measured IR radiances and radiative temperatures of the flash sources in this study can be used to estimate the effects of flashes on various IR devices, and play a critical role for the modeling and simulation of the effects of a flash source on various IR devices.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Especially, the rainfall rate data of the weather radar are used to validate the new 2-D and 3-DCRR calibration matrixes suitable for the Korean peninsula for the period of 24 rainy days in 2011. The 2D and 3D calibration matrixes provide the basic and maximum CRR values (mm h−1) by multiplying the rain probability matrix, which is calculated by using the number of rainy and no-rainy pixels with associated 2-D (IR, IR-WV) and 3-D(IR, IR-WV, VIS) matrixes, by the mean and maximum rainfall rate matrixes, respectively, which is calculated by dividing the accumulated rainfall rate by the number of rainy pixels and by the product of the maximum rain rate for the calibration period by the number of rain occurrences. Finally, new 2-D and 3-D CRR calibration matrixes are obtained experimentally from the regression analysis of both basic and maximum rainfall rate matrixes. As a result, an area of rainfall rate more than 10 mm/h is magnified in the new ones as well as CRR is shown in lower class ranges in matrixes between IR brightness temperature and IR-WV brightness temperature difference than the existing ones. Accuracy and categorical statistics are computed for the data of CRR events occurred during the given period. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squire error (RMSE) in new 2-D and 3-D CRR calibrations led to smaller than in the existing ones, where false alarm ratio had decreased, probability of detection had increased a bit, and critical success index scores had improved. To take into account the strong rainfall rate in the weather events such as thunderstorms and typhoon, a moisture correction factor is corrected. This factor is defined as the product of the total precipitable waterby the relative humidity (PW·RH), a mean value between surface and 500 hPa level, obtained from a numerical model or the COMS retrieval data. In this study, when the IR cloud top brightness temperature is lower than 210 K and the relative humidity is greater than 40%, the moisture correction factor is empirically scaled from 1.0 to 2.0 basing on PW·RH values. Consequently, in applying to this factor in new 2D and 2D CRR calibrations, the ME, MAE, and RMSE are smaller than the new ones.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
One pot synthesis of environmentally friendly lignin nanoparticles with compressed liquid carbon dioxide as an antisolvent,2016,,,"<P>Nanoparticles from commercial kraft lignin were developed using a facile, one pot green technology of a compressed CO2 antisolvent. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was employed as an organic solvent to prepare the lignin solution. The effects of various process parameters: temperature, pressure, solution flow rate and initial solution concentration, on the product yields, morphology, size, size distribution, surface area and textural properties of the particles were investigated by FESEM, HRTEM analyses and BET analyzers, and their formation mechanisms were deduced by the solubility behavior of lignin with liquid CO2 and DMF in the operating system. Moreover, the quality of lignin nanoparticles were elucidated by ATR-FTIR, XPS, XRD, DSC, TG/DTA and UV-vis measurements. This study showed that as the temperature and lignin concentration increased, and the pressure and solution flow rate decreased, the degree of particle aggregation/coalescence and the size increased along with the broader size distribution. In particular, the coalescence of particles was strongly influenced by the operational pressure, and even more significant with the increasing temperature. As a result, uniform, quasi-spherical nanoparticles with a mean particle diameter of 38 nm were obtained at 280.2 K, 15.0 MPa, and 0.06 kg h(-1) of the solution flow rate and 5.3 wt% of the initial lignin concentration. Besides, the lignin nanoparticles have a relatively high BET surface area (nearly 92 m(2) g(-1)) which primarily consisted of mesopores, and exhibited higher UV absorbing and dispersion stability, enhanced solubility, and homogeneous thermal degradation activity as compared with the raw lignin. Noteworthily, their biodegradable and biocompatible character may render them a candidate for applications in cosmetics, health and drug delivery systems.</P>",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

It is a process in which one of the two corporate bodies is absorbed and merged into the other one. In most cases, the corporate body who is acquiring the other usually covers the cost of merger and acquisition. This, on the other hand, puts her in the need of vast amount of financial resource. In order to acquire such resource, the company can use the assets of the company being acquired as collateral for the loans (Leveraged Buyout) allowing the company to takeover another company without committing a lot of capital In Sinhan LBO case, the court assessed the leveraged buyout as the breach of trust and gave a criminal penalty. However, in Hanil LBO case and Onse Communication LBO case, the court did not see the act of leveraged buyout as the breach of trust. The difference between Sinhan LBO case and the other two cases are as follows. In Sinhan LBO case, the company being acquired, S&K World Korea’s assets wereused as collateral for the loans before the actual acquisitions took place. However, in the other two cases, there existed a contract between the companies as to provide the assets of the companies being acquired as collateral for the loans but the provision of security did not happen before the actual acquisitions took place. From this, two questions arise. First is how to define the subject of the damage occurred, and second is the standard for assessing the damage. There are three conflicting theories that try to answer these questions and of those three, the ‘companytheory’ is the most reasonable answer. By applying this theory, the precedent’s stance can be easily understood.Moreover, it can be questioned whether it is justifiable to see the provision of security as damage. In the capitalist society, the trade of goods occurs through the means of money and this money functions as a unifying measure of value. Consequently, when an asset such as real property is provided as security, the value of that specific assetalso decreases by that amount of security. Therefore, it is justifiable to see the provision of security as damage. The precedent refers to this as ‘a risk of property damage’. Furthermore, it can be questioned whether the damage can be acknowledged based on an unfair merger. In the field of accounting, mergers and acquisitions is seen as a purchase. The ｢Corporate Accounting Standards Book(1103rd)｣, lists detailed accounting standards for calculating the acquisition cost and acquisition value during a business merger. According to this standard, the company may be sold at a price that is lower or higher than its actual value but as long as it does not exceed the usual trade custom, it is difficult to see an unfair merger as damage.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
보르도 와인과 부르고뉴 와인의 대조적 특성,2016,"['보르도', '부르고뉴', '샤토', '클리마', '퀴베', 'Bordeaux', 'Bourgogne', 'chateau', 'climats', 'cuvee']",,"This study aims to compare and discuss wine of the world`s most famous regions for wine production, Bordeaux and Bourgogne from the contrasting perspective and to reveal unique characteristics of the wine of the two regions, which have extreme diversity. Bordeaux wine and Bourgogne wine are so diverse that it may not be easy to conduct an analysis contrasting them, but this paper would describe them, focusing on their aspects with distinctive features. This is because it is judged that there are no other regions that show more distinctive features than these two regions, of the regions of wine production in the world. Bordeaux wine is historically considered to have a close relationship with the United Kingdom. This is to say that Bordeaux became a territory of the U.K. in the 12th century and became that of France in the 13th century, and the wine industry was developed greatly thanks to the British Monarchy. In other words, unlike wine in other regions of France, it enjoyed a privilege in exporting wine and this privilege lasted till the 18th century. In contrast, it is noted that Bourgogne wine was maintained and developed by church unlike Bordeaux wine. In fact, in the Middle Ages, the church was the pivot of vine culture in any place throughout the Europe. This is because wine at the time was altar wine of all Christians, and therefore, vine culture was maintained by the church and continuously handed down to the posterity. Cluny Abbey and Citeaux Abbey in Bourgogne played these roles. Bordeaux wine is a blended wine. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are its representative blending varieties. A big reason for blending in Bordeaux may be the climate there. We may note that Bourgogne wine is brewed with a single variety, no matter whether it is white wine or red wine. In addition, we can also point out that, in the Bourgogne region, no Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot varieties, which are the main varieties in the Bordeaux region, are grown. This may be because the climate is different and the soil on which grapes are grown differs, but it would be more reasonable that these two regions make efforts to produce a unique wine with a character of their own, rather than pursuing wine with a taste similar to that of each other. This is because the same variety can be grown in a different climate, soil and even in a different continent, as wine experts, too, point out, and because wine brewed with the same variety is considered one with a similar taste even if grown in a different soil. Bordeaux wine is considered Chateau wine. In other words, the name Chateau is marked on most of the wine labels. However, the term Chateau is a term that hardly means architecture where medieval lords lived. It seems that it was used to mean a vineyard that refers to one that produces commercially premium wine only. Bourgogne wine is Clima wine. Like the term Chateau on Bordeaux wine, the name Clima is used on most of the premium Bourgogne wine labels. Clima determines the grade of Bourgogne wine as well. Many famous vineyards in the Bordeaux region have mass produced wine from a long time ago, while those in the Bourgogne region have a characteristic of production in small quantities. In other words, Bordeaux vineyard owners own a large number of vineyards while Bourgogne vineyard owners own only very small vineyards. Based on this fact, it can be argued that vineyard owners in the two regions present a distinct contrast to each other. In other words, Bordeaux vineyard owners show an image of bourgeois, while Bourgogne vineyard owners show a rustic appearance. Consumers of Bordeaux wine and Bourgogne wine, also, are definitely distinguished from each other. Bordeaux wine was consumed mainly in the United Kingdom while Bourgogne wine was consumed mainly in the Continent. It is very interesting that the bottle shape is certainly different between the two regions. This, too, is one of the grounds that the vineyards in the two regions produce very characteristic wine.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Twenty-five male Spraue-Dawley(SD) rats (6 weeks old) were randomly divided into control group and 4 swimming groups after hyperlipidemia induction for 4 weeks 1% cholesterol diet, and then swimming groups swam for 6 weeks (7days/week) divided into 30 min. unloaded swimming group, 30 min. loaded swimming group, 60 min. unloaded swimming group and 60 min. loaded swimming group by swimming duration and intensity. The loaded swimming group rats among swimming groups swam a lead weight equivalent to 5% of body weight attached to the base of the tail. Analytical items were serum lipid components (total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and TC/HDL-C ratio). All data were expressed as mean and standard deviation by using SPSS/PC+ program, and data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis (K) and Mann-Whitney U test (α=.05) was performed to test the significant levels of differences between groups. The conclusions obtained from this study were as follows; 1) In generally, swimming groups were significantly lower than control group in TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C and TC/HDL-C ratio (p＜.001). 2) In HDL-C, 30 min. loaded swimming group and 60 min. unloaded swimming group were significantly higher than control group, 30 min. unloaded swimming group and 60 min. loaded swimming group (p＜.01). In conclusion, this study suggested that regular swimming is effectively enhanced partly on serum lipid profiles in hyperlipidemic state by exercise intensity and duration.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
Quantitative Definition and Spatiotemporal Distribution of Little Water Season (LIWAS) in Korea,2016,"['Little water season', 'available water resources index', 'little water intensity', 'water deficit intensity']",,"Like other continental climatic regions Korea has a period around the spring when agricultural activities are interrupted frequently by a shortage of available water resources during the season.This season, which is termed the Little Water Season (LIWAS) in this study, has important implications for many socio-economic activities but the scientific definition of this season remains vague. In this study, the onset and termination dates, as well as the characteristics of the LIWAS have been defined based on the Available Water Resources Index (AWRI). Based on the proposed definition of LIWAS, the implications on hydrological conditions over a range of geographic scales and their inter-annual variations on the water resource environments in Korea have been assessed. To develop an appropriate index for LIWAS based on AWRI, the criterion value (CV) for LIWAS was set as the lowest 25th percentile of the AWRI values averaged for 30 years (1981-2010). Therefore, the Little Water Season for Korea (LIWAS_K) was considered as the period when the daily averaged AWRIs were successively lower than the CV (143.7 mm). Based on this, the mean onset and end date of LIWAS_K, was 9 February and 11 May which also reflected the period in the spring season when the available water resources are expected to the lowest. Moreover, a number of seasonal characteristics of the water availability during the LIWAS, such as the Little Water Intensity (LWI), Water Deficit Amount (WDA) and Water Deficit Intensity (WDI) have been defined for the particular study region. Based on our results, we aver that the proposed season classification of the LIWAS can be better analyzed using the concept of usable water resources as a classification of dry period instead of using temperature and raw rainfall datasets.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic value between conventional FLAIR (TR = 9000 ms, FLAIR9000) and shorter-TR FLAIR (TR = 6000 ms, FLAIR6000) at 3T in terms of diffusion-weighted imaging-FLAIR mismatch.Materials and Methods: We recruited 184 patients with acute ischemic stroke (28 patients < 4.5 hours) who had undergone 5-mm diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and two successive 5-mm FLAIR images (no gap; in-plane resolution, 0.9 x 0.9 mm) at 3T with a 32-channel coil. The acquisition times for FLAIR9000 and FLAIR6000 were 108 seconds (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions [GRAPPA] = 2) and 60 seconds (GRAPPA = 3), respectively. Two radiologists independently assessed the paired imaging sets (DWI-FLAIR9000 and DWI-FLAIR6000) for the presence of matched hyperintense lesions on each FLAIR imaging. The signal intensity ratios (area of DWI lesion to contralateral normal-appearing region) on both FLAIR imaging sets were compared.Results: DWI-FLAIR9000 mismatch was present in 39 of 184 (21.2%) patients, which was perfectly the same on FLAIR6000. Three of 145 patients (2%) with DWImatched lesions on FLAIR9000 had discrepancy on FLAIR6000, showing no significant difference (P > 0.05).

In a number of major cases of the Supreme Court, It suggested that the 'Doubleness' of tax investigation have the next two factors : the identical tax item, and the same tax period. In other words, the legal meaning that a problematic case has the 'Doubleness' of tax investigation should be based on two tax investigation which happens to examine the identical tax item and the same tax period of a taxpayer twice. This legal interpretation also applies the national income(or corporative) tax and the local income tax cases. However, many taxpayers consider not to agree the interpretation by Courts. Because the national income(or corporative) tax and the local income tax share the identical calculation method of tax base in the income(corporation) tax act or the local tax act.There is, however, the above problem of many taxpayers' dissonance against the legal interpretation about the 'Doubleness' of the tax investigation. This problem should be mediated for securing the reasonableness of the local income tax and taxpayers' consensus.Second, it analyses the Japanese legislative case. This paper focuses on the Japanese local business tax case, because a tax system of this tax item(specially, 'taxation on income' part) is operated similarly such as the Korea does. Japan comes up with legislative measures in the local tax law. Japanese local tax authorities can operate tax investigation system about the local business tax in the local tax law. The japanese local tax law provides that the mandated local authority be depended on the situs of the head office or the effective management office if two or more local authorities can investigate the same taxpayer. By the way, there has maintained with the co-operative administration agreement between the Japanese central government and Local authorities (a.k.a. San-sei-kyouryoku). In conclusion, we may make a co-operative system between the National Tax Service and local authorities any time soon.In addition, we will also revise the local tax act for sharing tax investigation results between the central government and local tax authorities, adjusting individual tax investigation periods between three powers, and making an identical list of tax investigation",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

In the U.K., as the validity of all exceptions and limitation of liability clauses which protect the ship-owner is a question of construction, the parties to the contract may rely on an appropriately drafted clauses. Thus, it is highly advisable whether there was an agreement for the exclusion and limitation of the ship-owner s liability or not should be strictly examined, before discussing whether article 769(1) of the Korean Commercial Code (hereunder, KCC) applies to a specific claim or not. Meanwhile, the validity of any clauses exempting or/and limiting ship-owner s liability should be discussed in accordance with the period of the ship-owner s liability. In addition, it should be kept in mind that the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976 (hereunder, the LLMC 1976) has evolved with the close influences from other International Convention which dealt with the carriers  liability.

Therefore, given the purpose of the LLMC 1976 that the Convention was to extend the right to limit, not to restrict it, a claim for a ship-owner s liability for mis-delivery of goods without exchange of the original bills of lading can be referred in article 2(1)(a) of the LLMC 1976, subject to article 3 and 4 of the LLMC 1976.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
보수환수제도의 경제적 효과,2016,"['클로백', '보수환수제도', '재무제표재작성', '유인보상체계', '투자효율성', 'clawback', 'compensation recovery provision', 'financial restatement', 'incentive compensation', 'investment efficiency']",,"This study examines economic effects of compensation recovery provision(clawbacks). Clawbacks are provisions that recover the incentive compensation of the CEO or the board of directors if financial statements are restated(Chan et al. 2012; Chan et al. 2015). While incentive schemes such as earnings-based and equity-based compensation can encourage managers to align managers’ incentives with investors’ wealth, these incentives can inflate reported earnings in order to maximize their utilities by using their discretion(Desai et al. 2006; DeHaan et al. 2013). Prior studies show a positive relation between incentive compensation schemes and accounting restatements(Desai et al. 2006; DeHaan et al. 2013). Prior studies also point out financial restatement occurs due to the CEO incentive compensation contract. Financial restatements can take a toll on the reputational penalties to the managers(Desai et al. 2006). Moreover, financial restatements can undermine shareholder credibility of financial information(Iskandar-Datta and Yonghong 2013). Clawbacks were first adopted by Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act(SOX) in 2002 in order to mitigate accounting restatement. However, clawbacks under SOX era has been enforced in a few cases due to ambiguities in SOX 304(Fried and Shilon 2011; Chan et al. 2012). In recent years, clawbacks have attracted much attention as an object to deter manager’s financial restatement. Many companies have introduced clawback provisions voluntarily. Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) scrutinized CEO compensation contracts due to the financial crisis in 2007~2008. With Section 954 of Dodd-Frank Act(DFA) in 2010, clawback provisions improve on SOX 304 in that they expand applicable parties of clawbacks and do not require misconduct as a prerequisite(Chan et al. 2012). Futhermore, the SEC proposed that listed companies mandatorily develop and enforce new clawback policies on July 1, 2015. “The proposed rules would result in increased accountability and greater focus on the quality of financial reporting, which will benefit investors and the markets.” said SEC Chair Mary Jo White. What are the beneficial effects of clawbacks on investors and the capital markets? Clawback provisions decrease accounting restatements or earnings management and enhance internal control systems(Chan et al. 2012; DeHaan et al. 2013; Iskandar-Datta and Yonghong 2013). Moreover, investors consider accounting information to be more credible after clawbacks are adopted(Chan et al. 2012; DeHaan et al. 2013; Fung et al. 2015). Taken together, clawback provisions improve reporting quality and diminish financial reporting risk(Iskandar-Datta and Yonghong 2013). About 90% of companies in Fortune 100 index has adopted clawback provisions as of 2013. In 2015, developed countries such as U.S. or U.K. adopted clawbacks mandatorily while Korea does not adopt these compensation recoup provisions yet. I use a mathematical model to examine economic effect of clawback provisions. I find that clawbacks can mitigate the incentive of financial restatement, and improve investment efficiency. Clawback provisions make the CEO report to the investor integritously under incentive compensation scheme. On the other hand, I also show that the usefulness of clawbacks can deteriorate if managers’ ownership increases or if fixed compensation is clawed back. That is, clawback provisions can ex ante enhance reporting quality, and ex post penalize the CEO who manipulate accounting information. Despite the rise of clawbacks as means to diminish accounting restatement in U.S., few have attempted to address clawbacks in Korea. I shed light on important implications of clawbacks for regulators, managers, investors and auditors. Also, it is necessary for regulators to consider the adoption of clawbacks have many advantages.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
A Review on Shadow Director Cases in Korea,2016,"['Shadow Directors', 'Persons who Instruct Others to Conduct Business', 'Unauthorized Representative', 'Apparent Director', 'Apparent Agent', 'Liability of Shadow Directors', '업무집행관여자', '업무집행지시자', '무권대행자', '표현이사', '표현대리인', '업무집행관여자의 책임']","업무집행관여자에 대한 책임 제도는 1997년 IMF 경제위기가 상당부분 지배주주의 그릇된 경영관에서 비롯되었다고 보고, 이를 차단할 목적으로 1998년 상법개정시 도입된 제도이다. 이는 지배주주의 영향력에 의해 회사운영이 왜곡되는 것을 방지할 목적으로 이사 아닌 자로서 업무집행에 직 · 간접으로 관여한 자의 책임을 묻는 제도다. 상법 제401조의2는 세 가지 유형의 업무집행관여자의 책임을 규정하고 있다. 즉, ⅰ) 회사에 대한 자신의 영향력을 이용하여 이사에게 업무집행을 지시한 자(업무집행지시자), ⅱ) 이사의 이름으로 직접 회사에 업무를 집행한 자(무권대행자), 그리고 ⅲ) 이사가 아니면서 명예회장 · 회장 · 사장 · 부사장 · 전무 · 상무 · 이사 기타 업무를 집행할 권한이 있는 것으로 인정될 만한 명칭을 사용하여 회사의 업무를 집행한 자(표현이사) 등은 그 지시하거나 집행한 업무에 관하여 제399조(회사에 대한 책임), 제401조(제3자에 대한 책임) 및 제403조(대표소송)의 적용에 있어서 이사로 본다(제401조의2 제1항). 즉 이러한 자는 이사와 마찬가지로 회사 또는 제3자에 대해 손해배상책임을 지고 대표소송의 상대방이 되는 것이다. 제401조의2 제1항의 경우 회사 또는 제3자에 대하여 손해를 배상할 책임이 있는 이사는 업무집행지시자와 연대하여 책임을 진다(제401조의2 제2항). 지배주주의 책임에 관한 입법례로서, 미국의 보통법에서는 지배주주에게도 제한된 상황에서 다른 주주에 대해 신인의무(fiduciary duty)를 지는 것으로 이해하고 있다. 독일 주식법 제117조 제1항은 “고의로 회사에 대한 영향력(Einfluss auf die Gesellschaft)을 이용하여 이사, 감사, 상사대리인(Handlungsbevollmächtigte), 지배인 등으로 하여금 회사 또는 주주에게 손해를 가하게 한 자는 이로 인하여 회사에 발생한 손해를 배상할 책임이 있다. 주주가 손해를 입은 경우, 그 손해가 회사가 입은 손해의 결과인 경우(이른바 ‘간접손해’)를 제외하고 그 주주에게도 손해를 배상하여야 한다” 고 규정하여 지배주주의 지위남용에 대한 책임추궁의 수단으로 활용되고 있다. 영국 회사법상 배후이사(그림자이사: shadow director) 제도도 유사한 것이다. 이 논문에서는 특히 1998년 업무집행관여자의 책임 제도가 도입된 이후 내려진 8개의 국내 주요 판결들을 분석하고 그 시사점을 제시하였다. 특히 영미법상의 증거개시(Discovery) 제도가 없는 우리 법체제 아래에서는 제401조의2 제1항 제1호에 근거하여 업무집행지시자의 책임을 추궁하기가 현실적으로 어렵다는 점을 지적하고, 일정한 제한된 조건 아래에서 증명책임의 일부 전환이 필요하다는 점을 논의하였다. 또한 업무집행관여자에 대하여 경업금지의무(상법 제397조), 회사기회유용금지(제397조의2), 자기거래금지(제398) 등의 규정이 적용되는지 여부에 관해서도 명문의 규정을 두어 이를 금지할 필요성이 있다는 점을 검토하였다.","Korean legislators believed that the 1997 IMF Crisis had been at least partially caused by the improper and distorted business models and practices used by the major controlling shareholders of some big corporations. As a result, they amended the Korean Commercial Code (“KCC”) to introduce shadow director liability. This is a system designed to prevent controlling shareholders’ improper influence over the operation of a business by imposing liability upon those who are involved with the operation either directly or indirectly while not being a director of the corporation. Section 401-2 of the KCC classifies those who are involved with the operation either directly or indirectly into three different categories. First, persons who instruct directors using their influence over the corporation; second, persons who conduct the business of the corporation using the name of a director (unauthorized agent); and third, persons who conduct the business of a corporation using titles that give impression of authorization such as honorary chairman, chairman, president, vice president, executive manager, managing director or director while not being an actual director (apparent director). As for these persons, they will be deemed actual directors for the purposes of applying Sections 399 (liability to the corporation), 401 (liability to a third party), and 403 (derivative litigation) concerning the undertakings they instruct or conduct. In other words, these so-called shadow directs are liable for damages suffered by the corporation or third parties, and may become the target of derivative suits. Also, under Section 401-2 paragraph (1), if a director is liable for damages against the company or a third party, the director shall be jointly and severally liable with such shadow directors. If one considers the development of such concepts in other countries, one can find that, in the United States, controlling shares owe fiduciary duties to minor shareholders in limited circumstances under its common law tradition. As for Germany, Article 117(1) of German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) prescribes that any person who, by exerting his influence over the company, willfully induces a member of the management board or the supervisory board, a registered authorized officer or an authorized signatory to act to the disadvantage to company or its shareholders, shall be liable to the company for any resulting damages. Such person shall also be liable to the shareholders for any resulting damages insofar as they have sustained a loss in addition to the loss which they have sustained due to the damages to the company (so called “indirect damages”). This provision is utilized as means to impose liability with respect to the abuse of controlling shareholder’s position. The shadow director provisions in the U.K. Company Act are also similar to these provisions. This paper analyses eight major Korean cases involving the issues of shadow directors decided after the 1998 Amendment and discusses the significance of these opinions. Specifically, it points out that it is not very practical in Korea to impose liability on a shadow director under Section 401-2 paragraph (1) item 1, because Korea does not have liberal discovery rules that are available under the Anglo-American legal systems. Thus, this paper argues that in some specific situations, there should be a burden-shifting. In addition, it maintains that there must be provisions to impose upon such persons duty of loyalty such as the duty of non-competition under Section 397, the duty to refrain from using corporate opportunities under Section 397(2), and the duty against self-dealing under Section 398.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

California 사건 판결에서 지금까지 적용해 오던 적법한 체포에 부수하여 유형적 물체에 대한 영장 없는 수색을 허용하는 선례는 휴대폰에 저장되어 있는 디지털 컨텐츠에 관한 한 이치에 맞지 않는다고 판단하였다. 즉, 위급한 상황과 같은 특수한 상황에서는 특정한 휴대폰에 대한 영장 없는 수색이 정당화된다고 할 것이나 단순히 혐의자를 체포할 당시에 발견된 휴대폰이라는 사실만으로는 그 속에 내장된 디지털 컨텐츠를 영장 없이 수색하는 것은 허용되지 않는다는 입장이다. 그렇다면, 비밀스러운 문자메시지, 이메일, 사진, 은행거래기록, 연락처 목록이나 통화기록 등 방대한 생활영역에서 고도의 프라이버시 이익을 보관하는 휴대폰 컨텐츠의 수색은 위급한 상황이라는 특단의 사정이 없는 한 적법한 체포에 부수한 수색이라도 영장이 필요하다고 보아야 할 것이다. Riley 판결은 경찰관 뿐 아니라 새로운 기술이 문제가 되는 다른 상황에서 프라이버시 보호를 위하여 영장주의의 범위를 획정하려는 법관들에게도 지침을 제공할 것이다. 그런데 휴대폰의 수색과 프라이버시 보호문제의 긴장관계와 관련하여 법원이 이러한 문제를 다루는 데 과연 적합한 조직인가 하는 것이 여전히 의문으로 남는다. 입법부가 입법부는 선결례에 구속될 필요가 없이 기술의 팽창과 변화를 재빨리 반영할 수 있기 때문에 이러한 복잡한 문제의 해결에는 입법부가 보다 효과적인 조직이라는 견해가 많다. 우리 헌법 제12조 제3항은 ""체포·구속·압수 또는 수색을 할 때에는 적법한 절차에 따라 검사의 신청에 의하여 법관이 발부한 영장을 제시하여야 한다. 다만, 현행범인인 경우와 장기 3년 이상의 형에 해당하는 죄를 범하고 도피 또는 증거인멸의 염려가 있을 때에는 사후에 영장을 청구할 수 있다""고 규정하여 압수 또는 수색을 할 때에는 법관이 발부한 영장을 제시하여야 한다고 규정하는 한편 영장주의의 예외를 규정하고 있다. 우리 국회에 계류 중에 있는「국민보호와 공공안전을 위한 테러방지법안」 제16조는 테러통합대응센터의 장으로 하여금 테러단체 구성원이나 테러지원자로 의심할 만한 상당한 이유가 있는 자에 대하여 통신이용 관련 정보를 수집할 수 있도록 하고 있는 바, 이 조항은 일정한 자에 대하여 영장 없이 휴대폰을 포함한 통신 메타데이터의 수집을 허용하는 것에 해당한다. 영장주의와 관련하여 이 법안의 위헌성 여부가 검토될 필요가 있다.","Judging from the type and quantity of information stored on modern cell phones, a search of cell phone means that its owner suffers a significant intrusion on his private life. Considering this point, the U.S. Supreme Court`s recent decision in Riley v. California declared it unreasonable to apply its prior precedent to the digital contents that allows searches of physical objects without a warrant incident to a lawful arrest. Namely, in a particular situation such as exigent circumstances, a warrantless search of suspect`s cell phone can be still justified, however, a law enforcement officer can not search the digital contents of suspect`s cell phone without a warrant for the sole reason that it was found on the suspect at the time of arrest. If so, barring exceptional circumstances, a warrant is essential to the search of suspect`s cell phone storing private text messages, e-mail, pictures, call log, and bank transactions etc., even incident to a lawful arrest. The Riley court`s reasoning is expected to provide a guideline both to the police and the judges who attempt to demarcate the scope of application of the doctrine of warrants. There remains a question that the courts have suitable structures in resolving the strained relations between the government`s interests of law enforcement and individual`s privacy interests. There is a widespread belief that legislative bodies are better equipped entity to treat complex privacy protection problems because they are free from binding force of the precedents and can accept change wholeheartedly. The Constitution of the R.O.K. declares the doctrine of warrants in the provision of article 12 (3). It says that warrants issued by a judge through due procedures upon the request of a prosecutor shall be presented in case of arrest, detention, seizure or search, provided, that in a case where a criminal suspect is an apprehended flagrante delicto, or where there is danger that a person suspected of committing a crime punishable by imprisonment of three years or more may escape or destroy evidence, investigative authorities may request an ex post facto warrant. We have a pending bill in National Assembly allowing the investigative authorities to collect the cell phone metadata of the persons who supply reasonable ground for a doubt of terrorists or sponsors of terrorism. This bill justifies that metadata of cell phone can be collected from innocent people with no limit of period. In this respect, we need to review the tension between the doctrine of warrants and the collection of metadata.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Based on this, I revisit the political aims of Gaewha-dang and present a new perspective on the political situation over the modernizing policy. Yi had smuggled himself into Japan by request of Kim Ok-kyun and Pak Young-hyo in 1879, and made secret contacts with Japanese and western diplomats. Noticed by Kim Hong-jip who was dispatched to Japan as second Su-shin-sa(修信使, a envoy to Japan) in 1880, Yi managed to return home with him, but just after a few months he disappeared. In this article, a close examination was made about the backdoor diplomacy of Yi in Japan and the schemes conspired after his returning home through the unpublished diplomatic documents of Japan and U.K., and the meaning in relation to the political aims of Gaewha-dang was reinterpreted.  The backdoor diplomacy of Yi and Gaewha-dang provide some important implications on their political aims and the domestic situation at that time. First, Gaewha-dang was originally organized as a secret society pursuing grasp of power and the radical reformation of Chosun society by means of foreign forces. Second, in the perspective of the political end, athe secret society Gaewha-dang and the progressive ruling faction must be distinguished. Although the latter pursued modernizing policies to some extent, in that their basic goal was to maintain the status quo of power relations, their position was significantly different from Gaewha-dang. Therefore, the Imo Military Revolt of 1882 should be regarded as the starting point of the serious political struggle between Gaewha-dang and the progressive ruling faction, not the first chance of the disunity within the general progressive group.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Especially in case of the civil penalty, the law is developed by the Korean courts not by the black letter law mostly. Korean Court recognized the validity of the civil penalty in general unlikely to the US courts precedents. However Korean Court alleviated the burden sometimes based upon the Article 103 of Korean Civil Code. If a contractor wants to claim the contract deposit from the guarantor, the warranty events or insured events should occur before. It become an issue when the warranty events or insured events occur. When the legal nature of the contract deposit is a penalty for a breach of a contract, all the contract deposit belongs to the contractor.  In Mergers and Acquisition cases, Contractor’s holdback a.k.a Contractor deposit is used very often to secure the promised procedure of the said acquisition. In this regard, Korean Supreme Court Decision(2012Da65973) decided at 2016. 7. 14. that the legal nature of the Contractor’s holdback can be decided focusing on the essence of it not being determined by the heading of the clause. Basically Supreme Court understood that this is a issue of the interpretation of a contract whether a Contractor’s holdback is a previously fixed amount of damages or a penalty for a breach of a contract. However in this case Supreme Court decided the nature as predetermined damage not a penalty notwithstanding the express wording of the contract which was prepared by the lawyers and full understanding of the meaning partially because of the lack of the due diligence.

Sound has the property of being good or not good to listen to, but it has neither sorrow nor joy. Xi Kang thought that harmonious musical sounds arouse emotions hidden deeply inside an individual’s heart. The ideal instrument for playing harmonious music for Xi Kang was qin (琴), and qin requires quiet surroundings and a calm mind-set as the sound of qin is not as loud as other instruments. It is an important characteristic of Xi Kang’s music theory that it noted the importance of the surrounding environment and the mind-set of the player or the listener. In addition, just as one’s feelings change according to the sounds of instruments, Xi Kang believed that the emotions also change in response to the tunes of musical pieces. Xi Kang denied the representation or mimesis of specific emotions through music, but did not deny the affective expression or expression of aesthetic emotions through music. Xi Kang pursued the musical life with a focus on the meaning and performance of and listening to harmonious and peaceful music responding to the musical dynamics, pitch, and tempo without being heavily biased towards any particular emotions. Music can be regarded as the process of empowering the individual to make changes in a positive way by moving one’s sentiments using beautiful and harmonious sounds. Music safely guides one to take out emotions hidden inside, retrospect on them, and ultimately resolve them. The reason why people are touched by music is that music arouses the “fatalistic” deep sorrow within them but at the same time offers life, freedom and deep pleasure that help overcome or accept such emotions serenely. The harmonious emotion one reaches through this process is the musical emotion that accords with nature and dao 道. Xi Kang claims that the harmony and deep pleasure of the mind is expressed through music, and the sound of such music cultivates peaceful and harmonious spirit due to its embodiment of li 理(fundamental principle and texture) and harmonious qi 氣. The phrase “sound has neither sorrow nor joy” ( s h e n g w u ai l e 聲無哀樂) says that specific, binary emotions cannot be represented by sound and music, but it does not mean that the deep and profound pleasure cannot be expressed through music.

Methods: This retrospective study focused on progressive keratoconic eyes in Korean patients that underwent accelerated corneal cross-linking from February 2015 to October 2015. Keratoconus was diagnosed in 45 eyes in 30 patients. After accelerated corneal cross-linking with VibeX rapid solution, best corrected visual acuity, maximum keratometry, mean keratometry, corneal thickness, corneal astigmatism, and endothelial cell count were measured at the preoperative visit and post operation 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Results: Best corrected visual acuity (log MAR) was 0.51 ± 0.23 at pre operation and 0.51 ± 0.26 at post operation 6 months, showing no improvement. The maximum keratometry measured with Auto K, Pentacam, and Orbscan II at pre operation was 49.11 ± 4.5 D, 48.37 ± 3.31 D, and 48.98 ± 4.88 D and changed to 49.29 ± 4.34 D, 46.99 ± 3.63 D, and 47.01 ± 3.62 D postoperatively, respectively. Only Pentacam and Orbscan II measurements showed a statistically significant decrease (p 〈 0.05). Corneal thickness (at the thinnest area) was measured with Pentacam and Orbscan II; pre-operative and post-operative 6 month data showed changes from 485 ± 26.27 and 479.24 ± 27.89 to 471.64 ± 27.12 and 472.52 ± 25.36, respectively. Only the Pentacam method resulted in a statistically significant decrease. Endothelial cell count was measured with confocal microscopy and showed a statistically significant difference between pre-operative 2,857 ± 390.49/mm2 and post-operative 6 month 2,639.21 ± 249.92/mm2. Conclusions: This 6-month follow-up study of Korean keratoconus patients who underwent accelerated corneal cross-linking indicates that the method is effective in stabilizing the progression of keratoconus, according to maximum keratometry change. With regard to endothelial cell count change, further long-term evaluation is required. Other than endothelial cell count change, this procedure is expected to show long-term safety comparable to that of conventional corneal cross-linking.

However, in fact, the Madhyamaka School had a vital influence on the foundation of Esoteric Buddhism, and Acaryas of Esoteric Buddhism brought the doctrine to realize in the actual rite. It is possible to say that Esoteric Buddhism could not succeed in the history of Indian Buddhism without the devotion of the Madhyamaka School.60) The formation of Esoteric Buddhism firstly began by the adoption of religious elements from ancient religions of India. Among those elements, mantra and dharani contain lots of efficient expedients and tools to help the Dhyana and Samadhi of Buddhist practice, regardless of the religious background. Meanwhile, the practice system of the Madhyamaka School was built on the foundation of Yogacara practices, which were composed of listening and contemplating practices, which afterwards abridged to the practice of Samatha and Vipassana. In the early age of Mahāyana Buddhism, the practice to attain Buddhahood was to read and memorize sacred scriptures, but afterwards it adopted the mantra, dharani, mudra and maṇḍala as a Ālambana (所緣) to help the practice of Yogacara like Samatha and Vipassana. At first the Ālambana meant just a phenomenal externality of a practitioner’s mind, but soon those Ālambana became important elements of Accomplishment found in Buddha’s body of Nirmaṇa-kāya and Saṃbhoga-kāya. So lots of evidence has been found that the advent of Esoteric Buddhism in the history of Indian Buddhism did not originate from the outer Indian religions, but from internal and gradual process of ripening Buddhist expedients suggested by the masters of the Madhyamaka-yogacara School.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Purchasing decision of consumers are limited by their personal economic condition (Tully, Tershfield, and Meyvis 2015). In this situation, consumers feel economic powerlessness which can be defined as a feeling of relative deprivation by one`s personal economic condition. Then, how consumers do differentiated compensation consumption when they feel the economic powerlessness? The purpose of this study is to show how economic powerlessness has different impact on consumers behavior than social powerlessness does. This study also examines how materialism which is closely related to consumer behavior affect consumers` purchasing decisions under economic powerlessness. In order to achieve the purposes of this study, a series of 3 experiments were conducted, As a result of study 1, different from social powerlessness, economic powerlessness does not lead consumers to do compensation consumption with power-symbolic products. Study 2 reveals that consumers have stronger purchasing intentions for necessary goods when they feel economic powerlessness while consumers have stronger purchasing intentions for power-symbolic products when they feel economic confidence. Study 3 reveals that consumers with high materialism show stronger purchasing intentions for power-symbolic products even when consumers feel economic powerlessness. On the contrary, consumers with low materialism show stronger purchasing intentions for meaning-symbolic products when they feel economic powerlessness. This results demonstrates strong impact of materialism on consumers` behavior under economic powerlessness. This study has several significant contributions in that it distinguishes economic powerlessness from social powerlessness and examines how economic powerlessness influences consumers` purchasing behaviors. As economic recession continues, investigating consumer behavior under economic powerless is getting more significant. In this light, this study can play an important role as a basis for future studies in respective research area.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
Evaluating and addressing the effects of regression to the mean phenomenon in estimating collision frequencies on urban high collision concentration locations,2016,"['Random noise', 'Safety performance function', 'The regression to the mean', 'Empirical bayes method', 'Continuous risk profile']",,"Two different methods for addressing the regression to the mean phenomenon (RTM) were evaluated using empirical data: 1The Empirical Bayes (EB) method, which combines observed collision data and Safety Performance Functions (SPF) to estimate expected collision frequency of a site. 2Continuous Risk Profile (CRP), which estimates true collision profile constructed after filtering out the noise.  Data from 110 miles of freeway located in California were used to evaluate the performance of the EB and CRP methods in addressing RTM. CRP outperformed the EB method in estimating collision frequencies in selected high collision concentration locations (HCCLs). Findings indicate that the performance of the EB method can be markedly affected when SPF is biased, while the performance of CRP remains much less affected.

Towards this end, we discuss the problem of Bayesian predicting future observations from an exponential distribution based on an observed sample, when the information sample size is fixed as well as a random variable. Some distributions for the information sample size are considered and then for each case we find the parameter of distribution of the information sample size, such that the point predictor of a future order statistic has minimum mean squared prediction error when the total cost of experiment is bounded. To show the usefulness of our results, we present a simulation study. Finally, we apply our results to some real data sets in life testing.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv

Moralists were placed in front of Haedongmyeongsinrok and were importantly rated in Gukjomyeongsinrok(『國朝名臣錄』), which listed its items in the order of moral philosophy(道學), service(事業) and allegiance(忠節). Not follow structure of Songmyeongsineonhaengrok, which was organized in the former volume(前集), the latter volume(後集), the sequel to volume(續集), the supplementary volume(外集), Kim Yuk(金堉) faithfully reflected Zhuzi`s intention of compilation of Songmyeongsineonhaengrok in which he deemed highly of moralists by including them separately in the supplementary one. Similarly, narrative style of figure in Gukjomyeongsinrok also was a basic introduction of figure at the first, and descriptive part of one’s achievements and comments about one followed style of Songmyeongsineonhaengrok, which increased reliability and objectivity of records by making notes on sources. While compiling Gukjomyeongsinrok, soon after publishing Haedongmyeongsinrok, Kim Yuk added new figures and divided criteria for appraisal of figure into moral philosophy, service and allegiance more clearly. In comparison with Haedongmyeongsinrok, it contained items about allegiance differently to put more emphasis on it. Especially, his opinion of fidelity(節義) was so high that, in the part of allegiance, he treated heavily the people damaged by the GyeYujeongnan(癸酉靖難, the political change in 1453), Saengyukshin(生六臣, the survived six meritorious individuals), Sayukshin(死六臣, the dead six meritorious individuals) and the Sarim(士林, the literati of Joseon) damaged by Sahwa(士禍, the massacres of literati). Kim Yuk followed faithfully what Zhuzi`s Songmyeongsineonhaengro-k was understood by the Sarim in the 16th century, who considered it as a book clarifying the essentials of moral philosophy and its succession through one’s achievement and doctrinality. And he showed a face of pragmatic statesman with more emphasis of service and allegiance, practical aspects of moral philosophy. It also appeared in that he noticed and published Hyogyeong(『孝經』) and Chunggyeong(『충경』), Confucianism Classics(經學) of the Han-Tang(漢唐), the Sarim in the 16th century did not consider them important. It could be suggested that Kim Yuk reflected his own thoughts of statesman here, who, as a representative pragmatist of Joseon in the first half of the 17th century, organized internal affairs and stabilize the livelihoods of the people after struggling national crises. He placed a higher value on the confucianism focused in its Classics of the Han-Tang and some kinds of poetry and prose of the three masters(三家) in the age of Tang(唐代) than the poetry and prose(詩文) in the moral philosophical style(道學風) or neo-confucianism. It seems that Kim Yuk, a representative statesman in the 17th century, had ideological base of confucianism of Han-Tang, unlike Sarim in the 16th century looking upon the world in terms of morality and idealism of neo-confucianism by Zhuzi.",k-means_2016_academic_riss.csv
