Detection of Political Manipulation through Unsupervised Learning,2019,"['Political manipulation', 'fake news', 'online communities', 'WWW', 'unsupervised learning']",,"Political campaigns circulate manipulative opinions in online communities to implant false beliefs and eventually win elections. Not only is this type of manipulation unfair, it also has long-lasting negative impacts on people’s lives. Existing tools detect political manipulation based on a supervised classifier, which is accurate when trained with large labeled data. However, preparing this data becomes an excessive burden and must be repeated often to reflect changing manipulation tactics.We propose a practical detection system that requires moderate groundwork to achieve a sufficient level of accuracy. The proposed system groups opinions with similar properties into clusters, and then labels a few opinions from each cluster to build a classifier. It also models each opinion with features deduced from raw data with no additional processing. To validate the system, we collected over a million opinions during three nation-wide campaigns in South Korea. The system reduced groundwork from 200K to nearly 200 labeling tasks, and correctly identified over 90% of manipulative opinions. The system also effectively identified transitions in manipulative tactics over time. We suggest that online communities perform periodic audits using the proposed system to highlight manipulative opinions and emerging tactics."
The Unsupervised Learning-based Language Modeling of Word Comprehension in Korean,2019,"['Unsupervised learning', 'Morfessor', 'Surprisal', 'Lexical processing', 'Word recognition', '비지도 학습', '모페써', '놀라움', '선형 혼합 회귀 모형', '단어 판독']",,"We are to build an unsupervised machine learning-based language model which can estimate the amount of information that are in need to process words consisting of subword-level morphemes and syllables. We are then to investigate whether the reading times of words reflecting their morphemic and syllabic structures are predicted by an information-theoretic measure such as surprisal. Specifically, the proposed Morfessor-based unsupervised machine learning model is first to be trained on the large dataset of sentences on Sejong Corpus and is then to be applied to estimate the information-theoretic measure on each word in the test data of Korean words. The reading times of the words in the test data are to be recruited from Korean Lexicon Project (KLP) Database. A comparison between the information-theoretic measures of the words in point and the corresponding reading times by using a linear mixed effect model reveals a reliable correlation between surprisal and reading time. We conclude that surprisal is positively related to the processing effort (i.e. reading time), confirming the surprisal hypothesis."
Unsupervised online learning of temporal information in spiking neural network using thin-film transistor-type NOR flash memory devices,2019,,,"<P>Brain-inspired analog neuromorphic systems based on the synaptic arrays have attracted large attention due to low-power computing. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) algorithm is considered as one of the appropriate neuro-inspired techniques to be applied for on-chip learning. The aim of this study is to investigate the methodology of unsupervised STDP based learning in temporal encoding systems. The system-level simulation was performed based on the measurement results of thin-film transistor-type asymmetric floating-gate NOR flash memory. With proposed learning methods, 91.53% of recognition accuracy is obtained in inferencing MNIST standard dataset with 200 output neurons. Moreover, temporal encoding rules showed that the number of input pulses and the computing power can be compressed without significant loss of recognition accuracy compared to the conventional rate encoding scheme. In addition, temporal computing in a multi-layer network is suitable for learning data sequences, suggesting the possibility of applying to real-world tasks such as classifying direction of moving objects.</P>"
Joint Geometric Unsupervised Learning and Truthful Auction for Local Energy Market,2019,,,"<P>Development of smart grid technologies has created a promising atmosphere for smart cities and energy trading markets. Especially, traditional electricity consumers evolve into prosumers who produce as well as consume electricity in modern power electric systems. In this evolution, the electric power industry has tried to introduce the notion of <I>local energy markets</I> for prosumers. In the local energy market, prosumers purchase electricity from distributed energy generators or the other prosumers with surplus electricity via a local power exchange center. For this purpose, this paper proposes joint <I>geometric clustering</I> and <I> truthful auction</I> schemes in the local energy markets. The proposed <I>clustering</I> scheme is designed for distribution fairness of the distributed energy generator for serving prosumers, where the scheme is inspired by expectation and maximization based unsupervised learning. Moreover, this paper proposes an <I>auction </I> mechanism for truthful electricity trading in a local energy market. In order to guarantee truthful electricity trading, the proposed auction mechanism is constructed based on the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves auction, which was proven to guarantee truthful operations. The Hungarian method is also considered in addition to the auction. The simulation results for the auction verify that the utilities of local market energy entities are maximized when the prosumers are truthful.</P>"
Unsupervised learning with hierarchical feature selection for DDoS mitigation within the ISP domain,2019,"['ANN', 'artificial neural network', 'cyber security', 'DDoS mitigation', 'feature selection', 'self‐organizing map', 'unsupervised learning']",,"A new Mirai variant found recently was equipped with a dynamic update ability, which increases the level of difficulty for DDoS mitigation. Continuous development of 5G technology and an increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to the network pose serious threats to cyber security. Therefore, researchers have tried to develop better DDoS mitigation systems. However, the majority of the existing models provide centralized solutions either by deploying the system with additional servers at the host site, on the cloud, or at third party locations, which may cause latency. Since Internet service providers (ISP) are links between the internet and users, deploying the defense system within the ISP domain is the panacea for delivering an efficient solution. To cope with the dynamic nature of the new DDoS attacks, we utilized an unsupervised artificial neural network to develop a hierarchical two‐layered self‐organizing map equipped with a twofold feature selection for DDoS mitigation within the ISP domain."
"MuDeepNet: Unsupervised Learning of Dense Depth, Optical Flow and Camera Pose Using Multi-view Consistency Loss",2019,"['Deep learning', 'depth consistency loss', 'depth estimation', 'optical flow', 'optical flow consistency loss', 'visual odometry (VO)']",,"We take formulate structure from motion as a learning problem, and propose an end-to-end learning framework to calculate the image depth, optical flow, and the camera motion. This framework is composed of multiple encoder-ecoder networks. The key part of the network structure is the FlowNet, which can improve the accuracy of the estimated camera ego-motion and depth. As with recent studies, we use an end-to-end learning approach with multi-view synthesis as a variety of supervision, and proposes multi-view consistency losses to constrain both depth and camera ego-motion, requiring only monocular video sequences for training. Compared to the recently popular depth-estimation-networks using a single image, our network learns to use motion parallax correction depth. Although MuDeepNet training requires the use of two adjacent frames to obtain motion parallax, it is tested by using a single image. Thus, MuDeepNet is a monocular system. The experiments on KITTI dataset show our MuDeepNet outperforms other methods."
A Novel Text Sample Selection Model for Scene Text Detection via Bootstrap Learning,2019,"['detection', 'bootstrap learning', 'image segmentation', 'text sample selection model']",,"Text detection has been a popular research topic in the field of computer vision. It is difficult for prevalent text detection algorithms to avoid the dependence on datasets. To overcome this problem, we proposed a novel unsupervised text detection algorithm inspired by bootstrap learning. Firstly, the text candidate in a novel form of superpixel is proposed to improve the text recall rate by image segmentation. Secondly, we propose a unique text sample selection model (TSSM) to extract text samples from the current image and eliminate database dependency. Specifically, to improve the precision of samples, we combine maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs) and the saliency map to generate sample reference maps with a double threshold scheme. Finally, a multiple kernel boosting method is developed to generate a strong text classifier by combining multiple single kernel SVMs based on the samples selected from TSSM. Experimental results on standard datasets demonstrate that our text detection method is robust to complex backgrounds and multilingual text and shows stable performance on different standard datasets."
LEARNING TO RECOGNIZE DRIVING PATTERNS FOR COLLECTIVELY CHARACTERIZING ELECTRIC VEHICLE DRIVING BEHAVIORS,2019,"['Electric vehicles', 'Data mining', 'Energy management', 'Battery management systems', 'Machine learning']",,"As electric vehicle (EV) emerges, it is important to understand how driver’s driving behavior is influencing power consumption in an electric vehicle. Driver’s personal driving behavior is usually quite distinctive and can be recognized by means of driving patterns after some driving cycles. This paper presents a method combining several machine learning approaches to characterize driving behaviors of electric vehicles. The driving patterns are modeled according to power consumption monitored by the battery management system (BMS), in aspects of individual driver’s personal and EV-fleet operations. First, we apply an unsupervised clustering approach to characterize a driver's behaviors by formulating driving patterns. Subsequently, the resulting clustered datasets were used to train machine-learning based classifiers for classification of dataset of EV and EV-fleet driving patterns. The work aims to provide a robust solution to help identify the characteristics of specific types of EVs and their driver behaviors, in order to allow automakers and EV-subsystem providers to gather valuable driving information for product improvement."

Application of Deep Learning System into the Development of Communication Device for Quadriplegic Patient,2019,"['Eye', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Unsupervised machine learning', 'Quadriplegia', 'Caregiver']",,"ObjectiveIn general, quadriplegic patients use their voices to call the caregiver. However, severe quadriplegic patients are in a state of tracheostomy, and cannot generate a voice. These patients require other communication tools to call caregivers. Recently, monitoring of eye status using artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used in various fields. We made eye status monitoring system using deep learning, and developed a communication system for quadriplegic patients can call the caregiver.MethodsThe communication system consists of 3 programs. The first program was developed for automatic capturing of eye images from the face using a webcam. It continuously captured and stored 15 eye images per second. Secondly, the captured eye images were evaluated for open or closed status by deep learning, which is a type of AI. Google TensorFlow was used as a machine learning tool or library for convolutional neural network. A total of 18,000 images were used to train deep learning system. Finally, the program was developed to utter a sound when the left eye was closed for 3 seconds.ResultsThe test accuracy of eye status was 98.7%. In practice, when the quadriplegic patient looked at the webcam and closed his left eye for 3 seconds, the sound for calling a caregiver was generated.ConclusionOur eye status detection software using AI is very accurate, and the calling system for the quadriplegic patient was satisfactory."
An architecture of deep learning network based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition in precise identification of bearing vibration signal,2019,"['Bearing multi-degree fault diagnosis', 'Architecture of deep learning network (DLN)', 'Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)', 'Autoencoder', 'Softmax classifier']",,"This paper proposes a deep learning network (DLN) as the basis for a bearing fault diagnosis technique, which is constructed by the autoencoders and softmax classifier for the purpose of identifying the various multi-degree bearing fault. Firstly, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method is used to decompose the original vibration signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A highdimensionality feature vector is formed by analyzing the statistical parameters in the time domain and the frequency domain of the first several IMFs. Then, this feature vector serves as the input for DLN to classify the bearing fault pattern. In a DLN, an autoencoder performs the unsupervised feature self-learning phase to generate a final significant feature vector for training the softmax classifier. Finally, the parameters of a complete DLN based on stacking auto-encoders and the softmax classifier together is fine-tuned with respect to supervised learning criterion aiming to optimize the classification error. Experimental results have shown a great effect for bearing fault diagnosis based on the proposed DLN. The identification accuracy result has been achieved in the bearing fault status even with the unpredictable defects tests on the inner race and roller element of bearing. Methodologies in this study offer confidence for complex data classification."

Recent works have witnessed a substantial progress on the task due to the development of convolutional neural network (CNN).

In this paper, we present an unsupervised framework for removing rain streaks from real-world rainy images. We focus on the natural phenomena that static rainy scenes capture a common background but different rain streak. From this observation, we train siamese network with the real rain image pairs, which outputs identical backgrounds from the pairs.

This study proposes a method of applying a non-rigid registration to 3D magnetic resonance images of brain in an unsupervised learning environment by using a deep-learning network. A feature vector between two images is produced through the network by receiving both images from two different patients as inputs and it transforms the target image to match the source image by creating a displacement vector field. The network is designed based on a U-Net shape so that feature vectors that consider all global and local differences between two images can be constructed when performing the registration. As a regularization term is added to a loss function, a transformation result similar to that of a real brain movement can be obtained after the application of trilinear interpolation. This method enables a non-rigid registration with a single-pass deformation by only receiving two arbitrary images as inputs through an unsupervised learning. Therefore, it can perform faster than other non-learning-based registration methods that require iterative optimization processes. Our experiment was performed with 3D magnetic resonance images of 50 human brains, and the measurement result of the dice similarity coefficient confirmed an approximately 16% similarity improvement by using our method after the registration. It also showed a similar performance compared with the non-learning-based method, with about 10,000 times speed increase. The proposed method can be used for non-rigid registration of various kinds of medical image data."

It is difficult to estimate the wave celerity accurately using physics-based modeling in the coastal region, owing to the limitations of in-situ measurement and the high nonlinearity of wave phenomena itself as well as high complexity from nonlinear interactions. In order to estimate wave celerity, the proposed method learns the nonlinear wave behavior from the video imagery. Autoencoder is applied to separate hydrodynamics scenes from environmental factors, such as daylights. The displacement vector of propagating waves is computed by non-linear spatio-temporal image registration. The wave celerity is estimated by accumulating the displacement vectors along time. In this paper, we compare the wave celerity measurement with conventional image processing methods and actual measurement using sensors for accuracy evaluation."

In this regard, the purpose of this study is to propose a novel method to select the proper categorical variables in high-dimensional categorical data.Methods: The proposed feature selection method consists of three steps: (1) The first step defines the goodness- to-pick measure. In this paper, a categorical variable is relevant if it has relationships among other variables. According to the above definition of relevant variables, the goodness-to-pick measure calculates the normalized conditional entropy with other variables. (2) The second step finds the relevant feature subset from the original variables set. This step decides whether a variable is relevant or not. (3) The third step eliminates redundancy variables from the relevant feature subset.Results: Our experimental results showed that the proposed feature selection method generally yielded better classification performance than without feature selection in high-dimensional categorical data, especially as the number of irrelevant categorical variables increase. Besides, as the number of irrelevant categorical variables that have imbalanced categorical values is increasing, the difference in accuracy between the proposed method and the existing methods being compared increases.Conclusion: According to experimental results, we confirmed that the proposed method makes it possible to consistently produce high classification accuracy rates in high-dimensional categorical data. Therefore, the proposed method is promising to be used effectively in high-dimensional situation."

In this paper, we propose a new representation learning method, namely generative adversarial networks (GAN) based bagging deep convolutional autoencoders (GAN-BDCAE), which can map data to diverse hierarchical representations in an unsupervised fashion. To boost the size of training data, to train deep model and to aggregate diverse learning machines are the three principal avenues towards increasing the capabilities of representation learning of neural networks. We focus on combining those three techniques. To this aim, we adopt GAN for realistic unlabeled sample generation and bagging deep convolutional autoencoders (BDCAE) for robust feature learning. The proposed method improves the discriminative ability of learned feature embedding for solving subsequent pattern recognition problems. We evaluate our approach on three standard benchmarks and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to traditional unsupervised learning methods."

The key idea of the proposed technique is to learn representative features of the leak-free state using leak-free time-series acoustic data and the deep auto-encoder. The proposed technique can be used to create a PLD model that detects leaks in the pipeline in an unsupervised learning manner. This means that we only use leak-free data without labeling while training the deep auto-encoder. In addition, when compared to the previous supervised learning-based PLD method that uses image features, this technique does not require complex preprocessing of time-series acoustic data owing to the unsupervised feature extraction scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed PLD method using the deep auto-encoder can provide reliable PLD accuracy even considering unsupervised learning-based feature extraction."

In that work, I compared an 'image produced through artificial intelligence and big data' with an 'image of visual artwork' from the viewpoint of 'subject of image production' and the 'ontology of the produced image'. Although the former is not considered art thus far, the possibility of it becoming art is presented from the viewpoint of image ontology using the keyword 'unpredictability', which exists on both sides. 'Unpredictability' is a key feature of 'epistemic emergence'. In this regard, this study proceeds as follows to study the visual communication of Emergent Properties that extend earlier work on image ontology to the perspective of epistemology. Specifically, in Chapter 2 we consider that the 'image recognition of epistemology' has developed into a position of interaction between humans as subjects of recognition and images as objects of recognition. In Chapter 3, we examine how the 'image recognition of cognitive science' has functioned in human intelligence through the concept of 'image cognition'. In Chapter 4, 'image recognition in early machine learning' is examined by considering images that are grasped by supervised learning. In Chapter 5, we examine 'image recognition of deep learning' as artificial intelligence learns self-supervised learning through unsupervised learning to understand the semantics implied by an image rather than being limited to external classifications of images. In the last chapter, chapter 6,""Realization of Visual Art through Deep Learning,"" an actual work of three artists (team members) who are experimenting with deep running (Ham vanden Dorpel, Rachel Ara, and Forensic Architecture), is analyzed.

This methodology was possible because the dimension of the data was simple in the past, so the classical statistical method could work effectively.However, as the characteristics of data have changed complexly in the era of big data, it has become more difficult to accurately analyze and predict the data that occurs throughout the industry in the conventional way. Therefore, SVM and Decision Tree based supervised learning algorithms were used.However, there is peculiarity that supervised learning based model can only accurately predict the test data, when the number of classes is equal to the number of normal classes and most of the data generated in the industry has unbalanced data class. Therefore, the predicted results are not always valid when supervised learning model is applied. In order to overcome these drawbacks, many studies now use the unsupervised learning-based model that is not influenced by class distribution, such as autoencoder or generative adversarial networks.In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies using generative adversarial networks.AnoGAN, introduced in the study of Thomas et al (2017), is a classification model that performs abnormal detection of medical images. It was composed of a Convolution Neural Net and was used in the field of detection. On the other hand, sequencing data abnormality detection using generative adversarial network is a lack of research papers compared to image data. Of course, in Li et al (2018), a study by Li et al (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, has proposed a model to classify the abnormities of numerical sequence data, but it has not been used for categorical sequence data, as well as feature matching method applied by salans et al.(2016). So it suggests that there are a number of studies to be tried on in the ideal classification of sequence data through a generative adversarial Network. In order to learn the sequence data, the structure of the generative adversarial networks is composed of LSTM, and the 2 stacked-LSTM of the generator is composed of 32-dim hidden unit layers and 64-dim hidden unit layers. The LSTM of the discriminator consists of 64-dim hidden unit layer were used.In the process of deriving abnormal scores from existing paper of Anomaly Detection for Sequence data, entropy values of probability of actual data are used in the process of deriving abnormal scores. but in this paper, as mentioned earlier, abnormal scores have been derived by using feature matching techniques. In addition, the process of optimizing latent variables was designed with LSTM to improve model performance. The modified form of generative adversarial model was more accurate in all experiments than the autoencoder in terms of precision and was approximately 7% higher in accuracy.In terms of Robustness, Generative adversarial networks also performed better than autoencoder.Because generative adversarial networks can learn data distribution from real categorical sequence data, Unaffected by a single normal data. But autoencoder is not. Result of Robustness test showed that he accuracy of the autocoder was 92%, the accuracy of the hostile neural network was 96%, and in terms of sensitivity, the autocoder was 40% and the hostile neural network was 51%.In this paper, experiments have also been conducted to show how much performance changes due to differences in the optimization structure of potential variables. As a result, the level of 1% was improved in terms of sensitivity. These results suggest that it presented a new perspective on optimizing latent variable that were relatively insignificant."

Towards Personalized Intensive Care Decision Support Using a Bayesian Network: A Multicenter Glycemic Control Study,2019,"['Personalized glycemic control', 'Intensive care units', 'Bayesian network', 'Discretization technique', 'performance prediction']",,"Personalized treatment in glycemic control (GC) is a visibly promising research area that requires improved mechanisms providing patient-specific procedures to enable complicated decision support. Available per-patient data must be more than written records, and be fully integrated in this personalization process. This article presents a process for relating the intensive care unit patients’ demographic and admission data to their GC performance. With this objective, a probabilistic Bayesian network was chosen to provide more personalized decisions. As a case study, average daily blood glucose measurements were chosen as the interest target node in order to weigh GC that provides a reduced nursing workload. To test the idea, data from 482 patients, with nine variables from four Malaysian intensive care units with different controls were exploited. The identified steps crucial in building a dependable model are variable selection, continuous state discretization, and unsupervised structure learning. Using a multi-target node evaluation, a network with 80% mean overall classification precision was obtained with a normalized equal distance discretization algorithm and a maximum weight spanning tree technique. Meanwhile, the interest target node scored 90.39% precision. The results from this study, which are complemented with an evaluation of missing data, are proposed as a benchmark for using Bayesian networks in this type of application."

In this study, we developed a model in which a machine, not a person, reads the article, classifies the topic, and delivers it to each person in charge of the article. The article posted on the KEPCO homepage used in this study is a short sentence consisting of an average of 49 words. Due to the scarcity of multi-frequency words, it was found that there is a limit in securing a certain level of topic modeling accuracy in unsupervised machine learning like LDA. To overcome this, we labeled topics and let the machine conduct supervised learning. Although there are limitations in improving accuracy because there are articles containing more than two topics in one article, the classification accuracy is secured up to 84% by using LSTM and Baysian Optimization. The result of this study suggests that topic classification is possible for short-term customer questions in specific fields such as the electric power industry. In addition, it is expected that a model will be developed that can provide optimal reference answers for newly received questions when the topic-labeled questions and answers are fully accumulated."

Especially, the finance is one of the fields expected to have the usefulness and potential of text data analysis because it’s constantly generating new information, and the earlier the information is, the more valuable it is. Automatic knowledge extraction can be effective in areas where information flow is vast, such as financial sector, and new information continues to emerge. However, there are several practical difficulties faced by automatic knowledge extraction. First, there are difficulties in making corpus from different fields with same algorithm, and it is difficult to extract good quality triple. Second, it becomes more difficult to produce labeled text data by people if the extent and scope of knowledge increases and patterns are constantly updated. Third, performance evaluation is difficult due to the characteristics of unsupervised learning. Finally, problem definition for automatic knowledge extraction is not easy because of ambiguous conceptual characteristics of knowledge.  So, in order to overcome limits described above and improve the semantic performance of stock-related information searching, this study attempts to extract the knowledge entity by using neural tensor network and evaluate the performance of them. Different from other references, the purpose of this study is to extract knowledge entity which is related to individual stock items.

Before constructing the model, all reports of a training set are classified by stocks, and their entities are extracted using named entity recognition tool which is the KKMA. for each stocks, top 100 entities based on appearance frequency are selected, and become vectorized using one-hot encoding. After that, by using neural tensor network, the same number of score functions as stocks are trained. Thus, if a new entity from a testing set appears, we can try to calculate the score by putting it into every single score function, and the stock of the function with the highest score is predicted as the related item with the entity. To evaluate presented models, we confirm prediction power and determining whether the score functions are well constructed by calculating hit ratio for all reports of testing set.

Therefore, we do not use deep learning as a classification, but as a preprocessing process for feature extraction and propose a research method from which classifications can be made based on extracted features.

To solve the problem of overfitting because of an insufficient amount of labeled data, data augmentation is performed through rotation, using left and right flips to artificially increase the amount of data. Because various deeplearning architectures have been developed and publicized over the past few years, the results of the diagnosis can be obtained by entering a medical image.Results: Classification and regression are performed by a supervised machine-learning method and clustering and generation are performed by an unsupervised machine-learning method.

Automatic Image Annotation using Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm,2019,,,"In this paper, the proposed PCMRM (possibilistic based cross-media relevance model) annotates images based on their visual contents. PCMRM framework relies on unsupervised learning to group the visually similar image regions into homogeneous clusters, along with the cross-media relevance model (CMRM) that is used to estimate the joint distribution of textual keywords and images. Besides, the unsupervised learning task exploits the robustness to noise of a possibilistic clustering algorithm, and generates membership degrees that represent the typicality of image regions with respect to the obtained clusters. To validate and assess the proposed system, we used the standard Corel dataset. PCMRM produced promising results. The reported performance measures proved that the proposed automatic image annotation approach outperforms similar state of the art solutions. This attainment is mainly attributed to the exploitation of the possibilistic membership produced by the clustering algorithm which allowed accurate learning of the association between annotating labels and the visual content of the image regions."

The discriminator usually performs too good when helping the generator to learn statistics of the training datasets. Thus, the generated data is not compelling.Various research have focused on how to improve the stability and classification accuracy of GAN. However, few studies delve into how to improve the training efficiency and to save training time.

In the coastal area, image analysis methods such as particle tracking and optical flow with video imagery are usually applied to measure ocean waves owing to some difficulties of direct wave observation using sensors. However, external factors such as ambient light and weather conditions considerably hamper accurate wave analysis in coastal video imagery. The proposed method extracts hydrodynamic scenes by separating only the wave motions through minimizing the effect of ambient light during wave propagation. We have visually confirmed that the separation of hydrodynamic scenes is reasonably well extracted from the ambient light and backgrounds in the two videos datasets acquired from real beach and wave flume experiments. In addition, the latent representation of the original video imagery obtained through the latent representation learning by the variational autoencoder was dominantly determined by ambient light and backgrounds, while the hydrodynamic scenes of wave propagation independently expressed well regardless of the external factors."

To address this issue, modal parameters identified throughout the life of the bridge need to be compared and linked with each other, which is the process of mode tracking. The modal frequencies for a long-span bridge are typically closely-spaced, sensitive to the environment (e.g., temperature, wind, traffic, etc.), which makes the automated tracking of modal parameters a difficult process, often requiring human intervention. Machine learning methods are well-suited for uncovering complex underlying relationships between processes and thus have the potential to realize accurate and automated modal tracking. In this study, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), a popular unsupervised machine learning method, is employed to automatically determine and update baseline modal properties from the identified unlabeled modal parameters. On this foundation, a new mode tracking method is proposed for automated mode tracking for long-span bridges. Firstly, a numerical example for a three-degree-of-freedom system is employed to validate the feasibility of using GMM to automatically determine the baseline modal properties. Subsequently, the field monitoring data of a long-span bridge are utilized to illustrate the practical usage of GMM for automated determination of the baseline list. Finally, the continuously monitoring bridge acceleration data during strong typhoon events are employed to validate the reliability of proposed method in tracking the changing modal parameters. Results show that the proposed method can automatically track the modal parameters in disastrous scenarios and provide valuable references for condition assessment of the bridge structure."

It has been shown that the benchmark programs exhibit a varying degree of dissimilarity in their temporal behavior. In addition, the proposed framework can be used to model the ATP of superscalar processors adequately and optimize their design to increase their ATP levels."
