"Semi-supervised Cross-media Feature Learning via Efficient L<sub>2,q</sub> Norm",2019,"['Cross-media retrieval', 'semi-supervised regularization', 'L<sub>2', 'q</sub> norm', 'sparse regularization']",,"With the rapid growth of multimedia data, research on cross-media feature learning has significance in many applications, such as multimedia search and recommendation. Existing methods are sensitive to noise and edge information in multimedia data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method for cross-media feature learning by means of L<sub>2,q</sub> norm to improve the performance of cross-media retrieval, which is more robust and efficient than the previous ones. In our method, noise and edge information have less effect on the results of cross-media retrieval and the dynamic patch information of multimedia data is employed to increase the accuracy of cross-media retrieval. Our method can reduce the interference of noise and edge information and achieve fast convergence. Extensive experiments on the XMedia dataset illustrate that our method has better performance than the state-of-the-art methods."
Quark Gluon Jet Discrimination with Weakly Supervised Learning,2019,"['QCD', 'Jet', 'Fragmentation', 'Weakly supervised learning', 'Machine learning']",,"Deep learning techniques are currently being investigated for high energy physics experiments, to tackle a wide range of problems, with quark and gluon discrimination becoming a benchmark for new algorithms. One weakness is the traditional reliance on Monte Carlo simulations, which may not be well modelled at the detail required by deep learning algorithms. The weakly supervised learning paradigm gives an alternate route to classication, by using samples with different quark{ gluon proportions instead of fully labeled samples. This paradigm has, therefore, huge potential for particle physics classication problems as these weakly supervised learning methods can be applied directly to collision data. In this study, we show that realistically simulated samples of dijet and Z+jet events can be used to discriminate between quark and gluon jets by using weakly supervised learning. We implement and compare the performance of weakly supervised learning for quark{gluon jet classication using three different machine learning methods: the jet image-based convolutional neural network, the particle-based recurrent neural network and and the feature-based boosted decision tree."
Supervised learning‐based DDoS attacks detection: Tuning hyperparameters,2019,"['accuracy of detection', 'DDoS attack', 'long short‐term memory', 'machine learning', 'tensorflow']",,"Two supervised learning algorithms, a basic neural network and a long short‐term memory recurrent neural network, are applied to traffic including DDoS attacks. The joint effects of preprocessing methods and hyperparameters for machine learning on performance are investigated. Values representing attack characteristics are extracted from datasets and preprocessed by two methods. Binary classification and two optimizers are used. Some hyperparameters are obtained exhaustively for fast and accurate detection, while others are fixed with constants to account for performance and data characteristics. An experiment is performed via TensorFlow on three traffic datasets. Three scenarios are considered to investigate the effects of learning former traffic on sequential traffic analysis and the effects of learning one dataset on application to another dataset, and determine whether the algorithms can be used for recent attack traffic. Experimental results show that the used preprocessing methods, neural network architectures and hyperparameters, and the optimizers are appropriate for DDoS attack detection. The obtained results provide a criterion for the detection accuracy of attacks."
Development of Supervised Machine Learning based Catalog Entry Classification and Recommendation System,2019,"['카테고리 자동 추천', '온라인 B2B 소핑몰', '지도학습 기반 머신 러닝', '형태소 분석', 'Naïve Bayes 분류.', 'Catalog Entry Auto-Recommendation', 'Online B2B Shopping Mall', 'Supervised Machine Learning', 'Morphological Analysis', 'Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm.']",,"In the case of Domeggook B2B online shopping malls, it has a market share of over 70% with more than 2 million members and 800,000 items are sold per one day. However, since the same or similar items are stored and registered in different catalog entries, it is difficult for the buyer to search for items, and problems are also encountered in managing B2B large shopping malls. Therefore, in this study, we developed a catalog entry auto classification and recommendation system for products by using semi-supervised machine learning method based on previous huge shopping mall purchase information. Specifically, when the seller enters the item registration information in the form of natural language, KoNLPy morphological analysis process is performed, and the Naïve Bayes classification method is applied to implement a system that automatically recommends the most suitable catalog information for the article. As a result, it was possible to improve both the search speed and total sales of shopping mall by building accuracy in catalog entry efficiently."

Two person Interaction Recognition Based on Effective Hybrid Learning,2019,"['Action Recognition', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Deep Architecture', 'Transfer Learning']",,"Action recognition is an essential task in computer vision due to the variety of prospective applications, such as security surveillance, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. The availability of more video data than ever before and the lofty performance of deep convolutional neural networks also make it essential for action recognition in video. Unfortunately, limited crafted video features and the scarcity of benchmark datasets make it challenging to address the multi-person action recognition task in video data. In this work, we propose a deep convolutional neural network-based Effective Hybrid Learning (EHL) framework for two-person interaction classification in video data. Our approach exploits a pre-trained network model (the VGG16 from the University of Oxford Visual Geometry Group) and extends the Faster R-CNN (region-based convolutional neural network a state-of-the-art detector for image classification). We broaden a semi-supervised learning method combined with an active learning method to improve overall performance. Numerous types of two-person interactions exist in the real world, which makes this a challenging task. In our experiment, we consider a limited number of actions, such as hugging, fighting, linking arms, talking, and kidnapping in two environment such simple and complex. We show that our trained model with an active semi-supervised learning architecture gradually improves the performance. In a simple environment using an Intelligent Technology Laboratory (ITLab) dataset from Inha University, performance increased to 95.6% accuracy, and in a complex environment, performance reached 81% accuracy. Our method reduces data-labeling time, compared to supervised learning methods, for the ITLab dataset. We also conduct extensive experiment on Human Action Recognition benchmarks such as UT-Interaction dataset, HMDB51 dataset and obtain better performance than state-of-the-art approaches."
Patch based Semi-supervised Linear Regression for Face Recognition,2019,"['face recognition', 'semi-supervised', 'single sample per person', 'linear regression']",,"To deal with single sample face recognition, this paper presents a patch based semi-supervised linear regression (PSLR) algorithm, which draws facial variation information from unlabeled samples. Each facial image is divided into overlapped patches, and a regression model with mapping matrix will be constructed on each patch. Then, we adjust these matrices by mapping unlabeled patches to [1,1,···1]<sup>T</sup>. The solutions of all the mapping matrices are integrated into an overall objective function, which uses ℓ<sub>2,1</sub>-norm minimization constraints to improve discrimination ability of mapping matrices and reduce the impact of noise. After mapping matrices are computed, we adopt majority-voting strategy to classify the probe samples. To further learn the discrimination information between probe samples and obtain more robust mapping matrices, we also propose a multistage PSLR (MPSLR) algorithm, which iteratively updates the training dataset by adding those reliably labeled probe samples into it. The effectiveness of our approaches is evaluated using three public facial databases. Experimental results prove that our approaches are robust to illumination, expression and occlusion."
Detection of Political Manipulation through Unsupervised Learning,2019,"['Political manipulation', 'fake news', 'online communities', 'WWW', 'unsupervised learning']",,"Political campaigns circulate manipulative opinions in online communities to implant false beliefs and eventually win elections. Not only is this type of manipulation unfair, it also has long-lasting negative impacts on people’s lives. Existing tools detect political manipulation based on a supervised classifier, which is accurate when trained with large labeled data. However, preparing this data becomes an excessive burden and must be repeated often to reflect changing manipulation tactics.We propose a practical detection system that requires moderate groundwork to achieve a sufficient level of accuracy. The proposed system groups opinions with similar properties into clusters, and then labels a few opinions from each cluster to build a classifier. It also models each opinion with features deduced from raw data with no additional processing. To validate the system, we collected over a million opinions during three nation-wide campaigns in South Korea. The system reduced groundwork from 200K to nearly 200 labeling tasks, and correctly identified over 90% of manipulative opinions. The system also effectively identified transitions in manipulative tactics over time. We suggest that online communities perform periodic audits using the proposed system to highlight manipulative opinions and emerging tactics."
Reinforcement Learning based Single AI trained from Multi-game,2019,"['Reinforcement learning', 'Game AI', 'Deep learning']",,"Recently, AI Technologies have grown rapidly in various fields including game. There are many approaches to game AI. First, the supervised learning-based approaches are learned from the game play data, and mimic a series of the playing behavior. However, there are limitations in the complicated games due to the linear combination of input features. In order to solve these limitations by the linear combination, the deep neural network-based approaches utilizes more than two neural networks to represent the local characteristics and the global characteristics respectively.Still, these approaches require the enough training data. Without any already prepared training data, the reinforcement learning based approaches can be learned from the relations between the agent action and its reward in the environment, and aimed at that the agent obtains the maximum reward. In this paper, we propose a single AI trained from multi-games by the reinforcement learning. In the proposed AI model, every local agent plays each single game, while the global agent is learned from all local agents. Experimental results show that the agent learned from multi-games is adjusted well on both the training game and a new game, while the agent learned from a single game achieves good performance at only the training game."
Development of Predictive Models in Patients with Epiphora Using Lacrimal Scintigraphy and Machine Learning,2019,['Epiphora . Dacryocystography . Lacrimal scintigraphy . Machine learning . Deep learning . Convolutional neural network'],,"Purpose We developed predictive models using different programming languages and different computing platforms for machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) that classify clinical diagnoses in patients with epiphora.We evaluated the diagnostic performance of these models.Methods Between January 2016 and September 2017, 250 patients with epiphora who underwent dacryocystography (DCG) and lacrimal scintigraphy (LS) were included in the study.We developed five different predictive models usingMLtools, Pythonbased TensorFlow, R, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (MAMLS). A total of 27 clinical characteristics and parameters including variables related to epiphora (VE) and variables related to dacryocystography (VDCG) were used as input data. Apart from this, we developed two predictive convolutional neural network (CNN) models for diagnosing LS images. We conducted this study using supervised learning.Results Among 500 eyes of 250 patients, 59 eyes had anatomical obstruction, 338 eyes had functional obstruction, and the remaining 103 eyes were normal. For the data set that excluded VE and VDCG, the test accuracies in Python-based TensorFlow, R, multiclass logistic regression in MAMLS, multiclass neural network in MAMLS, and nuclear medicine physician were 81.70%, 80.60%, 81.70%, 73.10%, and 80.60%, respectively. The test accuracies of CNN models in three-class classification diagnosis and binary classification diagnosis were 72.00% and 77.42%, respectively.Conclusions ML-based predictive models using different programming languages and different computing platforms were useful for classifying clinical diagnoses in patients with epiphora and were similar to a clinician’s diagnostic ability."
"MuDeepNet: Unsupervised Learning of Dense Depth, Optical Flow and Camera Pose Using Multi-view Consistency Loss",2019,"['Deep learning', 'depth consistency loss', 'depth estimation', 'optical flow', 'optical flow consistency loss', 'visual odometry (VO)']",,"We take formulate structure from motion as a learning problem, and propose an end-to-end learning framework to calculate the image depth, optical flow, and the camera motion. This framework is composed of multiple encoder-ecoder networks. The key part of the network structure is the FlowNet, which can improve the accuracy of the estimated camera ego-motion and depth. As with recent studies, we use an end-to-end learning approach with multi-view synthesis as a variety of supervision, and proposes multi-view consistency losses to constrain both depth and camera ego-motion, requiring only monocular video sequences for training. Compared to the recently popular depth-estimation-networks using a single image, our network learns to use motion parallax correction depth. Although MuDeepNet training requires the use of two adjacent frames to obtain motion parallax, it is tested by using a single image. Thus, MuDeepNet is a monocular system. The experiments on KITTI dataset show our MuDeepNet outperforms other methods."
An architecture of deep learning network based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition in precise identification of bearing vibration signal,2019,"['Bearing multi-degree fault diagnosis', 'Architecture of deep learning network (DLN)', 'Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)', 'Autoencoder', 'Softmax classifier']",,"This paper proposes a deep learning network (DLN) as the basis for a bearing fault diagnosis technique, which is constructed by the autoencoders and softmax classifier for the purpose of identifying the various multi-degree bearing fault. Firstly, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method is used to decompose the original vibration signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A highdimensionality feature vector is formed by analyzing the statistical parameters in the time domain and the frequency domain of the first several IMFs. Then, this feature vector serves as the input for DLN to classify the bearing fault pattern. In a DLN, an autoencoder performs the unsupervised feature self-learning phase to generate a final significant feature vector for training the softmax classifier. Finally, the parameters of a complete DLN based on stacking auto-encoders and the softmax classifier together is fine-tuned with respect to supervised learning criterion aiming to optimize the classification error. Experimental results have shown a great effect for bearing fault diagnosis based on the proposed DLN. The identification accuracy result has been achieved in the bearing fault status even with the unpredictable defects tests on the inner race and roller element of bearing. Methodologies in this study offer confidence for complex data classification."
Injection mold design of reverse engineering using injection molding analysis and machine learning,2019,"['Computer-aided engineering', 'Injection molding', 'Warpage', 'Reverse engineering', 'Multilayer perceptron', 'Artificial neural networks']",,"Plastic composites are used in vehicle components to improve fuel efficiency. Thus, the warpage of injection-molded plastic parts has become a quality issue. Factors, such as product shape and thickness, resin, and other injection molding conditions, can be modified to improve the warpage problem. However, if these factors are set with no possible adjustments, reverse engineering may be required.Reverse engineering is a difficult process that requires many trials and errors; thus, it is only used as a last resort. With respect to the warpage issue, reverse engineering considers the following: (1) Predicting and (2) modeling the warpage in opposite directions. Autodesk Moldflow Insight accommodates these key considerations, but many researchers are reluctant to use it. Although existing injectionmolding analysis programs are mainly used to predict qualitative results, computer-aided engineering (CAE) for reverse engineering requires quantitative analysis. Hence, the considerations are different from the existing analyses. An error in warpage prediction may lead to a costly mold modification because of the molds' complex structures. Quantitative warpage prediction for reverse engineering depends on process variables; thus, understanding how warpages are affected by uncertain process variables is important to improve the reliability of reverse engineering. Moreover, even if appropriate process variables are set, they cannot be applied due to tolerance in lengths. For this reason, mold shrinkage must be identified before designing a mold. This study conducted injection molding analysis for a radiator tank that uses glass fiber-reinforced plastic using Autodesk Moldflow Insight 2018.2. Data for warpage prediction were generated in accordance with five process variables to identify the relationship between the level of warpage and process variables. CAE also showed the level of mold shrinkage that can reduce warpage. In addition, a predictive model was created using the multilayer perceptron (MLP)-supervised learning technique, which is a deep learning method for artificial neural networks. The predictive model was compared with typical regression models, such as polynomial regression (also known as response surface model), EDT and RBF, to determine the optimal approximation model. The real modeling time for a radiator tank product is 1 h, but the MLP approximation model required only 1 min and 8 s to perform 8530 iterations with a similar reliability."
FAST-ADAM in Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks,2019,"['Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Network', 'Lookahead', 'ADAM', 'Optimizer']",,"Unsupervised neural networks have not caught enough attention until Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was proposed. By using both the generator and discriminator networks, GAN can extract the main characteristic of the original dataset and produce new data with similar latent statistics. However, researchers understand fully that training GAN is not easy because of its unstable condition. The discriminator usually performs too good when helping the generator to learn statistics of the training datasets. Thus, the generated data is not compelling.Various research have focused on how to improve the stability and classification accuracy of GAN. However, few studies delve into how to improve the training efficiency and to save training time. In this paper, we propose a novel optimizer, named FAST-ADAM, which integrates the Lookahead to ADAM optimizer to train the generator of a semi-supervised generative adversarial network (SSGAN). We experiment to assess the feasibility and performance of our optimizer using Canadian Institute For Advanced Research – 10 (CIFAR-10) benchmark dataset. From the experiment results, we show that FAST-ADAM can help the generator to reach convergence faster than the original ADAM while maintaining comparable training accuracy results."

For instance, it can recommend a proper curriculum or learning method to individual users based on their learning history. To do this effectively, user’s characteristics need to be analyzed and classified based on various aspects such as interest, learning ability, and personality. Even though data labeled by the characteristics are required for more accurate classification, it is not easy to acquire enough amount of labeled data due to the labeling cost. On the other hand, unlabeled data should not need labeling process to make a large number of unlabeled data be collected and utilized. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method based on feedback variational auto-encoder(FVAE), which uses both labeled data and unlabeled data. FVAE is a variation of variational auto-encoder(VAE), where a multi-layer perceptron is added for giving feedback. Using unlabeled data, we train FVAE and fetch the encoder of FVAE. And then, we extract features from labeled data by using the encoder and train classifiers with the extracted features. In the experiments, we proved that FVAE-based semi-supervised learning was superior to VAE-based method in terms with accuracy and F1 score."

Labeling data was directly generated manually, so labeling accuracy of data is relatively high.However, it requires heavy efforts in securing data because of cost and time.Additionally, the main goal of supervised learning is to improve detection performance for ‘True Positive’ data but not to reduce occurrence of ‘False Positive’ data. In this paper, the occurrence of unpredictable ‘False Positive’ appears by trained modes with labeling data and ‘True Positive’ data in monitoring of deep learning-based CCTV accident detection system, which is under operation at a tunnel monitoring center.Those types of ‘False Positive’ to ‘fire’ or ‘person’ objects were frequently taking place for lights of working vehicle, reflecting sunlight at tunnel entrance, long black feature which occurs to the part of lane or car, etc. To solve this problem, a deep learning model was developed by simultaneously training the ‘False Positive’ data generated in the field and the labeling data. As a result, in comparison with the model that was trained only by the existing labeling data, the re-inference performance with respect to the labeling data was improved. In addition, re-inference of the ‘False Positive’ data shows that the number of ‘False Positive’ for the persons were more reduced in case of training model including many ‘False Positive’ data.

For this purpose, learning through immersive virtual reality was compared with learning using PPT slides, a widely used traditional multimedia. A total of 30 international middle school students participated in the experiment, among which 15 students were randomly assigned to the immersive VR group and the others were assigned to the PPT slide group. Under the supervision of a teacher, two groups of learners studied by themselves using different multimedia for about 30 minutes. The results indicated that learners using the newly developed VR contents felt less cognitive load and less negative emotions, and were more interested in learning compared with learners using PPT slides. Regarding the student learning outcomes, there was no statistically significant difference between two groups right after the experiment, yet the four weeks delayed test showed that the learners in the immersive VR group had a significantly higher score compared to the PPT slide group. These results were due to students' voluntary study after the experiment. Based on these results, it is concluded that immersive VR learning can reduce the cognitive load of learners if it is systematically designed as a way to reduce cognitive load based on multimedia education theory. In addition, immersive VR learning might have relatively long-term effects on learners by making them experience positive emotions towards learning and become more motivated to engage in learning.

Consistent with this perspective, we view transfer as a series of choices that trainees make to discard, maintain, apply, or modify trained knowledge and skills in their work context. Many empirical studies have been conducted examining the relationship between predictor constructs and transfer outcomes.A researcher(Blume et al., 2010) conducted a meta-analysis of this empirical research and showed that certain individual difference factors such as conscientiousness and certain contextual factors such as supervisory support predict transfer outcomes such as use and effectiveness. In addition, they found that pre- and post-training interventions had small effects on transfer outcomes. Also found evidence that most predictor variables had stronger relationships to transfer when the focus of training was on open as opposed to closed skills.Because of behavioral science research in general, and transfer of training in particular, has prompted increasing concerns about the applicability of findings to the problems of most pressing and substantive interest such as does not verifying the relationship between learning support and workplace environmental change, job performance.Based on these arguments, the aim of this research was to investigate the effects of perceived learning support on the employees’ adaptive performance. Also we test the mediating effects of self-efficacy between those of relationship reflected social cognitive theory perspectives. Perceived learning support divided into three concepts which supervision, coworker and organization components.From a social cognitive perspective(Bandura, 1997), learning and transfer outcomes are determined by individual cognition. One of important cognitive aspects related directly to training motivation and transfer are the individuals’ self-efficacy. Self-efficacy consists of an individual’s belief that they can successfully perform a task. Self-efficacy believed to enhance training motivation, a recognized antecedent of training effectiveness in both meta-analytic and empirical studies.Employees are unlikely to change their behaviour when they believe that they can perform a task in a competent manner, yet perceive that the organization will not respond to their improved performance. For this reason, an extension to current theoretical models is to examine how both training self-efficacy and instrumentality predict training transfer, and to clarify the intervening role of motivation to learn and motivation to transfer.Research on self-efficacy indicates that individuals higher in self-efficacy set more challenging goals for themselves than do individuals with lower self-efficacy. Such individuals are also more likely to be motivated to perform well in training and to transfer newly learned skills to the workplace.I conducted building direct, and mediating effect hypothesis. To test hypothesis, total of 257 questionnaires, multi source which self-report and supervision report, were used for analysis.The results are as follows. First, perceived supervisor and coworker learning support significantly increase self-efficacy. Second, self-efficacy significantly increase adaptive performance. Third, self-efficacy mediate between perceived supervisor, coworker learning support and adaptive performance. Finally, perceived organization learning support directly increase adaptive performance.Based on the results, I suggested social cognitive theory reflected implications of research interest of learning leading to the job performance and practical insight of management and learning invest of company's effort.

We focus on the natural phenomena that static rainy scenes capture a common background but different rain streak. From this observation, we train siamese network with the real rain image pairs, which outputs identical backgrounds from the pairs.

In that work, I compared an 'image produced through artificial intelligence and big data' with an 'image of visual artwork' from the viewpoint of 'subject of image production' and the 'ontology of the produced image'. Although the former is not considered art thus far, the possibility of it becoming art is presented from the viewpoint of image ontology using the keyword 'unpredictability', which exists on both sides. 'Unpredictability' is a key feature of 'epistemic emergence'. In this regard, this study proceeds as follows to study the visual communication of Emergent Properties that extend earlier work on image ontology to the perspective of epistemology. Specifically, in Chapter 2 we consider that the 'image recognition of epistemology' has developed into a position of interaction between humans as subjects of recognition and images as objects of recognition. In Chapter 3, we examine how the 'image recognition of cognitive science' has functioned in human intelligence through the concept of 'image cognition'. In Chapter 4, 'image recognition in early machine learning' is examined by considering images that are grasped by supervised learning. In Chapter 5, we examine 'image recognition of deep learning' as artificial intelligence learns self-supervised learning through unsupervised learning to understand the semantics implied by an image rather than being limited to external classifications of images. In the last chapter, chapter 6,""Realization of Visual Art through Deep Learning,"" an actual work of three artists (team members) who are experimenting with deep running (Ham vanden Dorpel, Rachel Ara, and Forensic Architecture), is analyzed. This study will contribute to explorations of the relationship between the aesthetic experience of artificial intelligence produced by artificial intelligence and meaning and artistic interpretation."

In many cases, few complete records are available without missing the data values. Statistical methods that replace the missing values with mean, mode and median are commonly used. In machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighborhood or decision tree, the missing values are replaced by estimation methods. The statistical method is a global method that replaces each attribute with a representative value, whereas the machine learning algorithm is a local method that replaces the attribute values similar to the records. However, it is difficult to use both methods for records that contain almost all the missing values. In order to overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a method to estimate values from neighborhood properties associated with large correlation with the missing attribute. It is based on correlation between attributes, and can be used even if the attributes carry almost missing values. In this proposed method, a correlation graph representing correlation coefficients related to attribute values was constructed based on graph-based semi-supervised learning. Missing values were estimated in proportion to the correlation coefficient derived from related attributes. In this paper, the proposed method compared the statistical method and machine learning algorithm, which are generally used for missing value imputation."

For the purpose of this report, we analyzed the present status of supervision in terms of goals, contents, methods, and subjects based on the major 2018 work plans of the 17 Provincial Offices, and the interviews with the supervisors. The main analysis results are as follows: First, the number of times the term supervision is used is 172 times and two education offices specified supervision in both the title and goal. The contents of supervision were in order of teaching and learning, school, class management and curriculum. Second, the method of supervision was mentioned 119 times, followed by consulting supervision, autonomous supervision, and supportive supervision. Most offices of education have mentioned autonomous supervision. Third, the major supervision workers are supervisors at the office of education in a city, school administrators, and other supervisors at the local office of education. From these results, first, the status of supervision work has been weakened. There were five school districts with less than two references to supervision , and even supervisors were reluctant to use the term supervision . Second, there is a gap between supervision theory and practice. Supervision methods that did not appear in the existing supervising theories were used. In terms of content and subject, it is operated differently from the text book. Third, supervision activities show various aspects in terms of their relevance to policy with the expansion of the superintendent s authority.

This methodology was possible because the dimension of the data was simple in the past, so the classical statistical method could work effectively.However, as the characteristics of data have changed complexly in the era of big data, it has become more difficult to accurately analyze and predict the data that occurs throughout the industry in the conventional way. Therefore, SVM and Decision Tree based supervised learning algorithms were used.However, there is peculiarity that supervised learning based model can only accurately predict the test data, when the number of classes is equal to the number of normal classes and most of the data generated in the industry has unbalanced data class. Therefore, the predicted results are not always valid when supervised learning model is applied. In order to overcome these drawbacks, many studies now use the unsupervised learning-based model that is not influenced by class distribution, such as autoencoder or generative adversarial networks.In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies using generative adversarial networks.AnoGAN, introduced in the study of Thomas et al (2017), is a classification model that performs abnormal detection of medical images. It was composed of a Convolution Neural Net and was used in the field of detection. On the other hand, sequencing data abnormality detection using generative adversarial network is a lack of research papers compared to image data. Of course, in Li et al (2018), a study by Li et al (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, has proposed a model to classify the abnormities of numerical sequence data, but it has not been used for categorical sequence data, as well as feature matching method applied by salans et al.(2016). So it suggests that there are a number of studies to be tried on in the ideal classification of sequence data through a generative adversarial Network. In order to learn the sequence data, the structure of the generative adversarial networks is composed of LSTM, and the 2 stacked-LSTM of the generator is composed of 32-dim hidden unit layers and 64-dim hidden unit layers. The LSTM of the discriminator consists of 64-dim hidden unit layer were used.In the process of deriving abnormal scores from existing paper of Anomaly Detection for Sequence data, entropy values of probability of actual data are used in the process of deriving abnormal scores. but in this paper, as mentioned earlier, abnormal scores have been derived by using feature matching techniques. In addition, the process of optimizing latent variables was designed with LSTM to improve model performance. The modified form of generative adversarial model was more accurate in all experiments than the autoencoder in terms of precision and was approximately 7% higher in accuracy.In terms of Robustness, Generative adversarial networks also performed better than autoencoder.Because generative adversarial networks can learn data distribution from real categorical sequence data, Unaffected by a single normal data. But autoencoder is not. Result of Robustness test showed that he accuracy of the autocoder was 92%, the accuracy of the hostile neural network was 96%, and in terms of sensitivity, the autocoder was 40% and the hostile neural network was 51%.In this paper, experiments have also been conducted to show how much performance changes due to differences in the optimization structure of potential variables. As a result, the level of 1% was improved in terms of sensitivity. These results suggest that it presented a new perspective on optimizing latent variable that were relatively insignificant."

We applied topic analysis to our data and in the process arrived at four perspectives on the sustainability factors of supervision. The four themes were ‘Being helpful,’ ‘Being a good learning experience,’ ‘Recognizing the need for a third party,’ and ‘Discovering possibilities.’ ‘Being helpful’ is the factor of continuing the supervision and involves ‘Being psychologically stable,’ ‘Knowing one’s limits’ and ‘Deepening the understanding of clients.’ We classified ‘Being a good learning experience’ as ‘Reflecting on oneself,’ ‘Learning through participation and observation’ and ‘Understanding human beings.’ We defined ‘Recognizing the need for a third party’ as the ability of counselors to see their blind spots. The fourth persistent factor is ‘Discovering possibilities,’ and applies equally to both the counselor and the client as they discover their potential."

The key idea of the proposed technique is to learn representative features of the leak-free state using leak-free time-series acoustic data and the deep auto-encoder. The proposed technique can be used to create a PLD model that detects leaks in the pipeline in an unsupervised learning manner. This means that we only use leak-free data without labeling while training the deep auto-encoder. In addition, when compared to the previous supervised learning-based PLD method that uses image features, this technique does not require complex preprocessing of time-series acoustic data owing to the unsupervised feature extraction scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed PLD method using the deep auto-encoder can provide reliable PLD accuracy even considering unsupervised learning-based feature extraction."

Mask R-CNN을 이용한 물체인식 및 개체분할의 학습 데이터셋 자동 생성,2019,"['Object Detection', 'Instance Segmentation', 'Deep Learning', 'Dataset Generation']",,"A robot usually adopts ANN (artificial neural network)-based object detection and instance segmentation algorithms to recognize objects but creating datasets for these algorithms requires high labeling costs because the dataset should be manually labeled. In order to lower the labeling cost, a new scheme is proposed that can automatically generate a training images and label them for specific objects. This scheme uses an instance segmentation algorithm trained to give the masks of unknown objects, so that they can be obtained in a simple environment. The RGB images of objects can be obtained by using these masks, and it is necessary to label the classes of objects through a human supervision. After obtaining object images, they are synthesized with various background images to create new images. Labeling the synthesized images is performed automatically using the masks and previously input object classes. In addition, human intervention is further reduced by using the robot arm to collect object images. The experiments show that the performance of instance segmentation trained through the proposed method is equivalent to that of the real dataset and that the time required to generate the dataset can be significantly reduced."

However, the time it takes for a customer to receive an answer includes a time for the article to be selected by the person in charge of the reply, which limits the shortening. In this study, we developed a model in which a machine, not a person, reads the article, classifies the topic, and delivers it to each person in charge of the article. The article posted on the KEPCO homepage used in this study is a short sentence consisting of an average of 49 words. Due to the scarcity of multi-frequency words, it was found that there is a limit in securing a certain level of topic modeling accuracy in unsupervised machine learning like LDA. To overcome this, we labeled topics and let the machine conduct supervised learning. Although there are limitations in improving accuracy because there are articles containing more than two topics in one article, the classification accuracy is secured up to 84% by using LSTM and Baysian Optimization. The result of this study suggests that topic classification is possible for short-term customer questions in specific fields such as the electric power industry. In addition, it is expected that a model will be developed that can provide optimal reference answers for newly received questions when the topic-labeled questions and answers are fully accumulated."

Although a target domain is related to source domains in any way, the underlying distributions generating instances are different. This inevitably carries on the so called concept drift phenomenon which means the input-output dependency changes across the domains. Under the concept drift, many ensemble learning algorithms have been suggested and showed quite good results. In this paper, we apply an ensemble learning scheme for semi-supervised domain adaptation as in the concept drift learning where a penalized regression based ensemble combiner is utilized. The proposed method is applied to a sentiment classification and shows a good result."
Text Classification with Heterogeneous Data Using Multiple Self-Training Classifiers,2019,"['Text Mining', 'Text Classification', 'Heterogeneity Learning', 'Semi-Supervised Learning', 'Ensemble Learning']",,"Text classification is a challenging task, especially when dealing with a huge amount of text data. The performance of a classification model can be varied depending on what type of words contained in the document corpus and what type of features generated for classification. Aside from proposing a new modified version of the existing algorithm or creating a new algorithm, we attempt to modify the use of data. The classifier performance is usually affected by the quality of learning data as the classifier is built based on these training data. We assume that the data from different domains might have different characteristics of noise, which can be utilized in the process of learning the classifier. Therefore, we attempt to enhance the robustness of the classifier by injecting the heterogeneous data artificially into the learning process in order to improve the classification accuracy. Semi-supervised approach was applied for utilizing the heterogeneous data in the process of learning the document classifier. However, the performance of document classifier might be degraded by the unlabeled data. Therefore, we further proposed an algorithm to extract only the documents that contribute to the accuracy improvement of the classifier."
Medical Image Analysis Using Artificial Intelligence,2019,"['Artificial Intelligence (AI)', 'Medical images', 'Deep-learning', 'Machine-learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)', 'Big data']",,"Purpose: Automated analytical systems have begun to emerge as a database system that enables the scanning of medical images to be performed on computers and the construction of big data.Deep-learning artificial intelligence (AI) architectures have been developed and applied to medical images, making high-precision diagnosis possible.Materials and Methods: For diagnosis, the medical images need to be labeled and standardized.After pre-processing the data and entering them into the deep-learning architecture, the final diagnosis results can be obtained quickly and accurately. To solve the problem of overfitting because of an insufficient amount of labeled data, data augmentation is performed through rotation, using left and right flips to artificially increase the amount of data. Because various deeplearning architectures have been developed and publicized over the past few years, the results of the diagnosis can be obtained by entering a medical image.Results: Classification and regression are performed by a supervised machine-learning method and clustering and generation are performed by an unsupervised machine-learning method. When the convolutional neural network (CNN) method is applied to the deep-learning layer, feature extraction can be used to classify diseases very efficiently and thus to diagnose various diseases.Conclusions: AI, using a deep-learning architecture, has expertise in medical image analysis of the nerves, retina, lungs, digital pathology, breast, heart, abdomen, and musculo-skeletal system."

To answer this question, we first examined how the supervision has been developed from the theoretical and institutional perspectives, and faced several limitations in terms of measuring teaching skills and quality which is supposed to be tackled task by supervision for its improvement. This study compared the various measurement tools developed according to the interest in 'observable teacher's instructional and teaching behavior'. Among them, the ICALT (International Comparative Analysis of Learning and Teaching) tool shows the better validity and reliability in diagnosing the teacher's teaching expertise, which is independent of various classroom context variables such as school levels and subjects. The first trial research conducted for Korean secondary school teachers in 2014 showed the highly significant reliability(cronbach aplha >.80) and model validity(TLI.>.90, CFI>.90, RMSEA<.08). As the supervision theory can be approached by the scientific inquiry to study the teaching skill in such a rigorous and evidence-based method rather than those conventional methods that have been pursuing the improvement of education based only on the simple beliefs that the quality of education depends on the quality of teachers."

"Multi-co-training for document classification using various document representations: TF–IDF, LDA, and Doc2Vec",2019,"['Document classification', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'TF&#x2013']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The purpose of document classification is to assign the most appropriate label to a specified document. The main challenges in document classification are insufficient label information and unstructured sparse format. A semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach could be an effective solution to the former problem, whereas the consideration of multiple document representation schemes can resolve the latter problem. Co-training is a popular SSL method that attempts to exploit various perspectives in terms of feature subsets for the same example. In this paper, we propose multi-co-training (MCT) for improving the performance of document classification. In order to increase the variety of feature sets for classification, we transform a document using three document representation methods: term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF–IDF) based on the bag-of-words scheme, topic distribution based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and neural-network-based document embedding known as document to vector (Doc2Vec). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MCT is robust to parameter changes and outperforms benchmark methods under various conditions.</P>"

Just a couple of years ago, they were independently studied in a supervised way, but now they are coupled and trained together in an unsupervised way. However, before designing fancy models and losses, we have to customize datasets to use them for training and testing. After training, the model has to be compared with the existing models, which is also a huge burden. The benchmark provides input dataset ready-to-use for VO and MDE research in ‘tfrecords’ format and output dataset that includes model checkpoints and inference results of the existing models. It also provides various tools for data formatting, training, and evaluation.

To analyze human motion with micro-Doppler signatures measured by radar, a deep learning algorithm is one of the most effective approaches. Because deep learning requires a large data set, the high cost involved in measuring large amounts of human data is an intrinsic problem. The objective of this study is to augment human motion micro-Doppler data employing generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve the accuracy of human motion classification. Methods: To test data augmentation provided by GANs, authentic data for 7 human activities were collected using micro-Doppler radar. Each motion yielded 144 data samples. Software including GPU driver, CUDA library, cuDNN library, and Anaconda were installed to train the GANs. Keras-GPU, SciPy, Pillow, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Git were used to create an Anaconda environment. The data produced by GANs were saved every 300 epochs, and the training was stopped at 3,000 epochs. The images generated from each epoch were evaluated, and the best images were selected.Results: Each data set of the micro-Doppler signatures, consisting of 144 data samples, was augmented to produce 1,472 synthesized spectrograms of 64 × 64. Using the augmented spectrograms, the deep neural network was trained, increasing the accuracy of human motion classification. Conclusions: Data augmentation to increase the amount of training data was successfully conducted through the use of GANs. Thus, augmented micro-Doppler data can contribute to improving the accuracy of human motion recognition."

For this, we propose self-examination, counseling and mentoring related on the potential for self-change as solutions. Also, SLP students' goal-directed score of avoidance of fulfillment is considered to lower students' learning motivation, so, new teaching methods using divergent questions and enforcement of absolute evaluation are needed. According to the study, students majoring in ECE have more satisfaction on opportunities of getting degree. Thus, guides on opportunities of degree achieving of major intensive program and qualifications of SLP certification of first grade should be increased. Also, we propose system improvement that wide choice of courses should be offered to students and full-time professor could be able to participate well, following demands of students."

From November 2016 to February 2017, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with eight counseling supervisors who were nominated as a master supervisor by their professional colleagues and data were analyzed using the consensual qualitative research method. Most participants acquired professional knowledge and skills in supervision by observing senior supervisors' performance or by gaining experience as supervisor, rather than taking a formal supervisor training. Transition from novice supervisor to expert supervisor occurred through changes from being client-focused to focusing on both supervisee and client, from delivering tasks to the supervisee to helping her learn from immediate experience in supervision sessions, and from imitating their role model in supervisory behaviors to keeping her own style. Recognition of the importance of the relationship with a supervisee, continuous learning about counseling and supervision from masters, and commitment to clinical experience served as leverage for growing as a supervisor. Based on the findings of this study, implications for supervisor training and future research are discussed."

Stochastic Non-linear Hashing for Near-Duplicate Video Retrieval using Deep Feature applicable to Large-scale Datasets,2019,"['Near-duplicate Video', 'NDVR', 'Class Activation Maps', 'Hashing', 'supervised learning']",,"With the development of video-related applications, media content has increased dramatically through applications. There is a substantial amount of near-duplicate videos (NDVs) among Internet videos, thus NDVR is important for eliminating near-duplicates from web video searches. This paper proposes a novel NDVR system that supports large-scale retrieval and contributes to the efficient and accurate retrieval performance. For this, we extracted keyframes from each video at regular intervals and then extracted both commonly used features (LBP and HSV) and new image features from each keyframe. A recent study introduced a new image feature that can provide more robust information than existing features even if there are geometric changes to and complex editing of images. We convert a vector set that consists of the extracted features to binary code through a set of hash functions so that the similarity comparison can be more efficient as similar videos are more likely to map into the same buckets.

Most of all, a significant change could be found in this work, with this writing as a turning point: while his studies before this had been intensely philosophical and theoretical, those afterwards dealt with realities. When Byeongin-yangyo (French campaign against Korea) happened, Yi Hang-Ro was appointed as Dong-bu-seung-ji (同副承旨). Although his government service tenure was short due to his old age, a commentary to the king that he had left during this period shows his determined will of Cheoksa-wijeong(斥邪衛正), which he had maintained all his life. It also shows his strong argument for fighting to protect the country against the Western barbarians. This is his Cheok-sa-so(斥邪疏, a commentary to the king arguing for expelling wickedness).This study investigates the theoretical basis and practice of ‘Cheoksa- wijeong(斥邪衛正) thought’ achieved by Hwaseo Yi Hang-Ro, a Confucian scholar in the late Joseon(朝鮮) period by focusing on 󰡔Ju-yeok-jeon-eui-dong-i- seog-eui(周易傳義同異釋義)󰡕 and  Cheok-sa-so. He argued for supervision of the moral mind from the perspective of Shim-ju-ri-ron(心主理論), and viewed the consciousness on  superior race and barbarians(華夷論) as an essential order based on Jon-wang-yang-i(尊王攘夷) of 󰡔Chun-chu(春秋)󰡕. Particularly, his idea of Cheoksa-euri became the philosophical framework for patriotism and defense of the motherland, which not only had a great effect during the national crisis in the late Joseon(朝鮮) period, but also led to the mobilization of volunteer soldiers through his proteges, leaving a grand mark in the anti-Japanese movement."

Eight cases were analysed using a consensual qualitative research method. The results of cross-analysis indicated four domains, within which there were a total of twelve categories: (a) Class experience in NRMT internship (cultivating clinical musicianship, feeling a lack of self-confidence, opportunity for advanced education); (b) Clinical experience in NRMT internship (moments of musical connection, difficulties due to incompetence as a clinician, learning through teamwork); (c) Supervision experience during NRMT internship (clinical analysis, increasing self-awareness, evaluation anxiety); (d) Growth through NRMT internship (becoming more accepting, becoming more confident as a clinician, expanding musical resources). Study findings suggest that participants developed both professionally and personally during NR internship programs. They also learned music-centered interventions, a distinctive feature of the NRMT approach. However, perspective of experiential learning during NRMT internship should be re-examined in a Korean cultural context."

Interview data, transcripts of 10 session group counseling, 13 session supervision reports, and reflection journal of research participants were analysed by narrative method. The results were as follows. The research participants experienced anxiety due to lack of self-confidence at the early stage of the group, tension due to the double relationship with supervisor and professor, the colleagues and group members, and collaboration among co-leaders. As the group sessions and supervision based on the Gestalt theory continued, they were able to recover self-confidence through theoretical learning, technique exercises, watching Pearls’ video, and active cooperation of group members. Over time, they gradually applied various techniques autonomously with ongoing supervision, and experienced group cohesion and willingness to resolve problems through brave self-exposures of several group members. In the process, cooperation between collaboration leaders has also been experienced, and positive experiences have been experienced in which the tension caused by the double relationship changes into deep trust.

The process of their growth was not just learning the words. For them, the learning process was a fungame. For visitors, the film was a device that evoked a  dialogue  that reminded them of their existence. Through the film, the director became a meaningful spokesman for how to meet old age. It was confirmed that the text-centered education in the education of grammar and grammar needs to be avoided, and that careful policy consideration andcultural support, such as the viewpoints and support of the parties, need to be expanded.The study was designed to strengthen emotional ties with goals reflecting learners  needs, away from the framework of functional literacy education."

As a result, the relationship with friend(-) had the highest influence on the adolescent problem behavior, followed by learning activity(-), inconsistency(+), ego-resilience(-), excessive interference(+), and supervision(-). However, the remaining sub-variables did not have any significant influence on the adolescent problem behavior. Second, the moderating effect of the ego-resilience on the relationship among the parents’ child-rearing attitude, adaptation to school life, and adolescent problem behavior. The ego-resilience was found to moderate the effects of parents’ positive child-rearing attitude, interpersonal relationships, and school adaptation on the adolescent problem behavior.

Foodservice staff ranked plate waste (82.7%) as the most generated waste. Regarding the menus generating plate waste, foodservice staff in elementary schools answered vegetable dishes and soups/stews, but the staff in middle and high schools answered vegetable and fish dishes as the dishes generating the most waste (p<0.001). The foodservice staff in elementary schools rated students’ picky eating as a major cause of generating plate waste and this factor was rated higher than that in high schools (p<0.001). To reduce plate waste, they strongly perceived that teachers should supervise students’ eating during mealtime and that students should understand the importance of environment conservation. The foodservice staff in the elementary schools showed a higher demand for ensuring enough lunch time for students as compared with that in middle and high schools for reducing plate waste (p<0.01). Self-service, selective menus, and use of tableware/utensils suitable for menus were rated the lowest for improving students’ consumption and reducing plate waste in all school levels.

ML-HDP: A Hierarchical Bayesian Nonparametric Model for Recognizing Human Actions in Video,2019,,,"<P>Action recognition from videos is an important area of computer vision research due to its various applications, ranging from visual surveillance to human–computer interaction. To address action recognition problems, this paper presents a framework that jointly models multiple complex actions and motion units at different hierarchical levels. We achieve this by proposing a generative topic model, namely, multi-label hierarchical Dirichlet process (ML-HDP). The ML-HDP model formulates the co-occurrence relationship of actions and motion units, and enables highly accurate recognition. In particular, our topic model possesses the three-level representation in action understanding, where low-level local features are connected to high-level actions via mid-level atomic actions. This allows the recognition model to work discriminatively. In our ML-HDP, atomic actions are treated as latent topics and automatically discovered from data. In addition, we incorporate the notion of class labels into our model in a semi-supervised fashion to effectively learn and infer multi-labeled videos. Using discovered topics and inferred labels, which are jointly assigned to local features, we present the straightforward methods to perform three recognition tasks including action classification, joint classification and segmentation of continuous actions, and spatiotemporal action localization. In experiments, we explore the use of three different features and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for these tasks on four public datasets: KTH, MSR-II, Hollywood2, and UCF101.</P>"

Accordingly, the planned characteristics of the housing units in the U.S. since the 1980s are: 1) rational planning of the dayroom and the cell, 2) efficient surveillance and working style, 3) natural lighting, 4) sharing of programs between the housing units. In particular, the State of Tennessee has been chosen as a research example because of its recognition for the need for facility reform since the 1980s and developed a prototype model through its own research and efforts.Therefore, in this study, the architectural planning characteristics of the U.S. housing unit were summarized more closely through the analysis of the medium-security level housing unit in Tennessee. Based on these analyses, the study compared and contrasted the status of domestic correctional facilities and examined the direction to be considered in future planning. When compared to the U.S., problems with domestic correctional facilities can be raised such as uniformity in the form of the housing unit, a lack of shared space and natural lighting, inefficient surveillance systems, and a lack of connectivity between functions. Therefore, the lessons learned from the U.S. case analysis are proposed to be adapted and applied to the situation in Korea. The details are as follows: 1) development of a prototype with a shared space plan and direct supervision system, 2) introduction of a team system, 3) planning considering the interconnection between functions."
