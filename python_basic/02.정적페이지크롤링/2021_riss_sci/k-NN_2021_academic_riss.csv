Improving Web Service Recommendation using Clustering with K-NN and SVD Algorithms,2021,"['Clustering', 'Collaborative Filtering', 'K-Nearest Neighbor', 'Recommendation', 'Singular Value Decomposition', 'Web Services']",,"In the advent of the twenty-first century, human beings began to closely interact with technology. Today, technology is developing, and as a result, the world wide web (www) has a very important place on the Internet and the significant task is fulfilled by Web services. A lot of Web services are available on the Internet and, therefore, it is difficult to find matching Web services among the available Web services. The recommendation systems can help in fixing this problem. In this paper, our observation was based on the recommended method such as the collaborative filtering (CF) technique which faces some failure from the data sparsity and the cold-start problems. To overcome these problems, we first applied an ontology-based clustering and then the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm for each separate cluster group that effectively increased the data density using the past user interests. Then, user ratings were predicted based on the model-based approach, such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and the predictions used for the recommendation. The evaluation results showed that our proposed approach has a less prediction error rate with high accuracy after analyzing the existing recommendation methods."

The wireless sensor enters the sleep state at a certain interval to conserve power. The Sleep deflation attack is a deadly attack that consumes power by preventing wireless sensors from entering the sleep state, but there is no clear countermeasure.

The Korea Forest Service attempted to quantify the soil creep susceptible areas using a discriminant value table to prevent or mitigate casualties and/or property damages in advance. With the advent of advanced computer technologies, machine learning-based classification models have been employed for managing mountainous disasters, such as landslides and debris flows. This study aims to quantify the soil creep susceptibility using several classifiers, namely the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. To develop the classification models, we downscaled 292 data from 4,618 field survey data. About 70% of the selected data were used for training, with the remaining 30% used for model testing. The developed models have the classification accuracy of 0.727 for k-NN, 0.750 for NB, 0.807 for RF, and 0.750 for SVM against test datasets representing 30% of the total data. Furthermore, we estimated Cohen's Kappa index as 0.534, 0.580, 0.673, and 0.585, with AUC values of 0.872, 0.912, 0.943, and 0.834, respectively.

Applying data mining techniques for forecasting geochemical anomalies,2021,"['Forecasting anomaly', 'Data mining techniques', 'Mahalanobis distance', 'U-statistics', 'Parkam']",,"Undoubtedly, forecasting the anomalous values could play an important role in the inchoate stages of exploration. Therefore, it is essential to find the most accurate approach to separate anomalous values from background and afterward use the results to anticipate each arbitrary sample. In this study, results of a structural multivariate method (the combination of Mahalanobis distance and U-statistics algorithms) are used to distinguish anomalous values from background. Then, three data mining methods will be applied to produce practical equations and finally estimate anomalous values. Actually, at the first, separation of geochemical anomalies, based on the combination of the U-statistics and the Mahalanobis distance approaches, would be done. Afterward, three data mining methods, K nearest neighbor (K-NN), decision tree, and naïve Bayes classifier have been applied based on separation results and the other parameters – x and y coordinates and Cu and Mo grades. For this purpose, after separation of anomalous values according to the number of 377 collected surface samples from Parkam porphyry system by applying above combination, the data mining methods would be utilized to anticipate anomalous values for each unknown point. Finally, in order to judge about the designed networks, training samples would be considered as test samples under the application of the networks. Results show that the decision tree method would appear as the more powerful approach than the other due to far fewer number of wrong estimated samples and approving high accuracy of the designed network. Noteworthy is that resubstitution error for this network is noted only 0.0212 based on numbers of wrong estimated samples (8 from 377). Whereas, the numbers of wrong estimated samples for K-NN and naïve Bayes methods are, respectively, 13 and 46 and the rates of error are 0.0345 and 0.122. Moreover, it was observed that the estimated samples (the joint points of Cu and Mo) delineated by decision tree method are closely associated with the defined zone of potassic alteration in the study area. Finally, according to results, it can be said that the combination of decision tree method and the introduced anomaly separation approach could be applied as a reliable and efficient technique to approach worthwhile predictions."

Detection of Atrial Fibrillation in Short-Lead Electrocardiogram Recordings Obtained using a Smart Scale,2021,,,"Atrial fi brillation (AF) is the type of arrhythmia that raises possibility of severe health problems such as heart failure and stroke and it is known that a major risk factor of AF includes overweight and obesity. Based on this association between such health-related indicators, we propose a smart scale that is capable of measuring weight and electrocardiography (ECG) simultaneously. The scale was developed using Arduino Uno, a Wheatstone bridge load cell, and ECG sensors. The ECG signals were processed to compute heart rate (in other words, RR interval). The smart scale was evaluated with four healthy volunteers in terms of reliability showing high agreement with a commercial device for ECG monitoring. In addition, it implements Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection using machine-learning classifi ers including a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method, a Decision Tree (DT), and a Neural Network (NN) on relatively short recordings of ECG obtained while using the scale. The root mean square of the successive diff erences between heart beats (RMSSD) and the Shannon entropy of the RR interval (ECG features) were extracted from ECG signals for AF detection. Performance of AF detection was tested with patients who were treated at a Cardiology Center after balancing data by applying over- and under-sampling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and the Tomek Link (T-Link) algorithm. After addressing the data imbalance, the AF detection performance of each classifi er (kNN, DT, and NNs) was 98.9%, 97.8%, and 98.9% respectively.

To effectively distribute police power through practical crime prediction, it is necessary to predict the time and place of the crime. Therefore, in this study, we train machine learning models with 9,413 instances of actual theft crime data having temporal-spatial elements such as crime time and date, buildings, land-use, and CCTV. Thereby, we intend to provide a basis for future research and assist crime prevention activities practically by comparing the results of the prediction models. In this study, we divided the target land into 100 m square grids by using GIS and then inserted crime and temporal-spatial related variables. Subsequently, we trained the typical machine learning models such as random forest, decision trees, SVC, and K-NN, conducted crime prediction, and compared the results of the models. In the case of crime data, generally, an excessive amount of unbalanced data is present for the places where crimes did not occur compared to places where crimes occurred. Unbalanced data can result in noise and cause inaccurate predictions-these issues must be addressed. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a resampling method as an alternative to solve data imbalances and provide crime prediction with improved accuracy. The results of the comparison of the prediction performance of the models showed that the F1 score of the random forest model using the SMOTE method was high. This could be because the data loss of the SMOTE method is less than that of the under-sampling method and the random forest as an ensemble type model has an advantage in predicting data with various variables. We compared the influence of each variable by employing the feature importance function. Overall, the temporal-related variables showed high influence-among them, crimes occurred within one month showed the highest influence. Among the physical environment-related variables, first neighborhood living facility, retail store, and detached house were found to have high influence."

Korean Learners’ Production of English Consonant Clusters with an Onset Liquid,2021,"['L2 production', 'L1 phonology', 'liquid', 'English consonantal clusters']",,"This study examined Korean learners’ production of intervocalic English biconsonantal clusters consisting of /p/, /t/, /k/, /m/, /n/, or /□/ followed by /l/ or /□/. The results of the production experiment showed several factors influencing Korean learners’ production. First, Korean learners’ production was influenced by their L1 sound inventory. The mispronunciation of a liquid (i.e., /l/ as [□] and /□/ as [l]) was observed and this will be due to the fact that [l] and [□] are not contrastive in Korean. Second, L1 phonological rules affecting a post-consonantal onset liquid influenced Korean learners’ production of English consonant clusters containing a liquid. The cluster /tl/ was mostly pronounced as [ll] and /nl/ as [ll] or [nn]. In addition, the nasalization of a stop consonant before a liquid was attested. Next, Korean learners’ production also exhibited the influence of phonetic similarity between the two members of a cluster by illustrating relatively lower production accuracy for /tl/, /t□/, and /nl/ consisting of two alveolar consonants. Finally, familiarity with the test words seemed to be a factor influencing Korean learners’ production. Korean learners illustrated relatively lower production accuracy for the words outlet and online which are frequently used as loanwords in Korea."
A comparison of machine learning algorithms for diabetes prediction,2021,"['Machine learning', 'Data Mining', 'Neural Network', 'K-fold Cross Validation', 'Accuracy']",,"Diabetes is a disease that has no permanent cure; hence early detection is required. Data mining, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and Neural Network (NN) methods are used in diabetes prediction in our research. We used the Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset for our research, collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about 768 patients and their corresponding nine unique attributes. We used seven ML algorithms on the dataset to predict diabetes. We found that the model with Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) works well on diabetes prediction. We built the NN model with a different hidden layer with various epochs and observed the NN with two hidden layers provided 88.6% accuracy."
