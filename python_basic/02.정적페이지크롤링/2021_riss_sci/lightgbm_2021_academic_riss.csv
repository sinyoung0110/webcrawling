In order to improve the classification accuracy for term deposit subscriptions, many studies have been conducted based on machine learning techniques. However, even if these models can achieve satisfactory performance, utilizing them is not an easy task in the industry when their decision-making process is not adequately explained. To address this issue, this paper proposes an explainable scheme for term deposit subscription forecasting. For this, we first construct several classification models using decision tree-based ensemble learning methods, which yield excellent performance in tabular data, such as random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). We then analyze their classification performance in depth through 10-fold cross-validation. After that, we provide the rationale for interpreting the influence of customer information and the decision-making process by applying Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), an explainable artificial intelligence technique, to the best classification model. To verify the practicality and validity of our scheme, experiments were conducted with the bank marketing dataset provided by Kaggle; we applied the SHAP to the GBM and LightGBM models, respectively, according to different dataset configurations and then performed their analysis and visualization for explainable term deposit subscriptions."

Based on the taxi DTG data that recorded the driving route from the taxi user’s entry point to the exit point, the ride rate analysis result was visualized as a heat map. The main travel routes of taxi users were found through the driving route. As a result of the loading rate analysis, it was confirmed that the loading rate was high in Dongseong-ro, the downtown area of Daegu Metropolitan City, and the nearby area of Dongdaegu Station. The following high passenger rate region was analyzed as the region with a high proportion of commercial facilities. In the case of movement routes, it was confirmed that they appear mainly along the same axis as subway lines and major arterial roads in the city. And through this, it was possible to obtain the implication that the infrastructure for shared autonomous vehicles could be built along arterial roads, auxiliary arterial roads, and subway lines in the future. In addition, this study established a regression model using machine learning techniques such as Random forest and LightGBM to confirm the variables that affect the user’s choice to use a taxi. The distance to the subway station, the arterial road, the number of floating population, the card sales performance, and the distance to the bus stop were derived as the primary variables that affect the decision of the taxi route. As a result of model estimation, it was found that both regression models secured the fit. It is expected that the results of this study can be utilized to strategically arrange essential infrastructure related to the driving of shared autonomous vehicles in consideration of changes in these influencing variables."

Thus, the prediction of chlorophyll-a concentration is essential for the proper management of water quality. However, the chlorophyll-a concentration is affected by various water quality and environmental factors, so the prediction of its concentration is not an easy task. In recent years, many advanced machine learning algorithms have increasingly been used for the development of surrogate models to prediction the chlorophyll-a concentration in freshwater systems such as rivers or reservoirs. This study used a light gradient boosting machine(LightGBM), a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm, to develop an ensemble machine learning model to predict chlorophyll-a concentration. The field water quality data observed at Daecheong Lake, obtained from the real-time water information system in Korea, were used for the development of the model. The data include temperature, pH, electric conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a. First, a LightGBM model was developed to predict the chlorophyll-a concentration by using the other seven items as independent input variables. Second, the time-lagged values of all the input variables were added as input variables to understand the effect of time lag of input variables on model performance. The time lag (i) ranges from 1 to 50 days. The model performance was evaluated using three indices, root mean squared error-observation standard deviation ration (RSR), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The model showed the best performance by adding a dataset with a one-day time lag (i=1) where RSR, NSE, and MAE were 0.359, 0.871 and 1.510, respectively. The improvement of model performance was observed when a dataset with a time lag up of about 15 days (i=15) was added."

KSURE(Korea Trade Insurance Corporation) is a major public institution for financial policy in Korea, and thus the company is strongly committed to backing export companies with various systems. Nevertheless, there are still fewer cases of realized business model based on big-data analyses.  In this situation, this paper aims to develop a new business model which can be applied to an ex-ante prediction for the likelihood of the insurance accident of credit guarantee. We utilize internal data from KSURE which supports export companies in Korea and apply machine learning models. Then, we conduct performance comparison among the predictive models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN(Deep Neural Network).  For decades, many researchers have tried to find better models which can help to predict bankruptcy since the ex-ante prediction is crucial for corporate managers, investors, creditors, and other stakeholders. The development of the prediction for financial distress or bankruptcy was originated from Smith(1930), Fitzpatrick(1932), or Merwin(1942). One of the most famous models is the Altmans Z-score model(Altman, 1968) which was based on the multiple discriminant analysis. This model is widely used in both research and practice by this time. The author suggests the score model that utilizes five key financial ratios to predict the probability of bankruptcy in the next two years. Ohlson(1980) introduces logit model to complement some limitations of previous models. Furthermore, Elmer and Borowski(1988) develop and examine a rule-based, automated system which conducts the financial analysis of savings and loans.  Since the 1980s, researchers in Korea have started to examine analyses on the prediction of financial distress or bankruptcy. Kim(1987) analyzes financial ratios and develops the prediction model. Also, Han et al.(1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2005, 2006) construct the prediction model using various techniques including artificial neural network. Yang(1996) introduces multiple discriminant analysis and logit model. Besides, Kim and Kim(2001) utilize artificial neural network techniques for ex-ante prediction of insolvent enterprises. After that, many scholars have been trying to predict financial distress or bankruptcy more precisely based on diverse models such as Random Forest or SVM. One major distinction of our research from the previous research is that we focus on examining the predicted probability of default for each sample case, not only on investigating the classification accuracy of each model for the entire sample.  Most predictive models in this paper show that the level of the accuracy of classification is about 70% based on the entire sample. To be specific, LightGBM model shows the highest accuracy of 71.1% and Logit model indicates the lowest accuracy of 69%. However, we confirm that there are open to multiple interpretations. In the context of the business, we have to put more emphasis on efforts to minimize type 2 error which causes more harmful operating losses for the guaranty company. Thus, we also compare the classification accuracy by splitting predicted probability of the default into ten equal intervals.  When we examine the classification accuracy for each interval, Logit model has the highest accuracy of 100% for 0~10% of the predicted probability of the default, however, Logit model has a relatively lower accuracy of 61.5% for 90~100% of the predicted probability of the default. On the other hand, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN indicate more desirable results since they indicate a higher level of accuracy for both 0~10% and 90~100% of the predicted probability of the default but have a lower level of accur"

The criteria for age classification were divided into groups in their 60s and older with a prevalence of 20% or more metabolic diseases and groups in their 30s and 40s with less than 10%. Using the LightGBM algorithm, we classified the differences in food consumption patterns in their 30s and 50s and 60s and found that the precision was 0.85, the reproducibility was 0.71, and F1_score was 0.77. The results of variable importance were confectionery, folio, seasoned vegetables, fruit vegetables, and marine products, followed by the top five values of the SHAP indicator: confectionery, marine products, seasoned vegetables, fruit vegetables, and folio vegetables. As a result of binary classification of consumption patterns as a median instead of the average sensitive to outliers, confectionery showed that those in their 30s and 40s were more than twice as high as those in their 60s. Other variables also showed significant differences between those in their 30s and 40s and those in their 60s and older.

To this end, 15 proactive information (e.g., number of stories and period of construction) that are usually available prior to construction were considered and two over-sampling techniques (SMOTE and ADASYN) were used to address the problem of class-imbalanced data. The results showed that all machine learning methods achieved 0.876~0.941 in the F1-score with the adoption of over-sampling techniques. LightGBM with ADASYN yielded the best prediction performance in both the F1-score (0.941) and the area under the ROC curve (0.941). The prediction models revealed four major features: number of stories, period of construction, excavation depth, and height.
