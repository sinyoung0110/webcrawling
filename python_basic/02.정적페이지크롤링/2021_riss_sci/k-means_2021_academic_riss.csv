In this study, k-means cluster analysis, random forest, and multinominal logistic regression were used to classify and explore major factors for each group. As a result of categorization through k-means cluster analysis, three groups were formed. Then, multinominal logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the effect size of the variable. Employment preference was categorized into “lower, “middle, and “upper groups. Depending on the characteristics of relative job preference, groups were categorized as “preferring future outlook, “preferring work environment, or “preferring social recognition. Second, the influencing factors for group categorization by job preference and relative job preference were “understanding oneself, “frequency of leisure activities, “interaction with other cultures, “leisure time/holidays, “average weekly exercise time, “average monthly living expenses, “reading preference, “monthly allowance amount, “life status, and “breakfast. Third, it was found that the individual variables of health, economic status, and parents socioeconomic status had a significant effect on classification. Based on these results, it is suggested that appropriate employment counseling and educational support be provided according to the type of job preference of university students."

The buoy data was used to identify the change in sea water temperature and the cold water occurrence at Gori and Yangpo in the Southeast Sea. As a result, the sea water temperature of Gori and Yangpo decreased equally at the cold water occurrence. Therefore, the reciprocal of the sea water temperature and the variance of SST were compared to see the changes of SST when the cold water occurs. When the reciprocal of the sea water temperature increases, the dispersion of SST also increases. Through this, it can be seen that there is a change in the water temperature distribution of SST in the sea when the cold water occurs. After that, K-means clustering was used to classify the cold water. After analyzing the optimal K value for clustering by using the Elbow method, it was possible to classify a region with cold water. Through this, it is estimated that the spatial distribution and diffusion range of the cold water, and it can be estimated and used in future studies to identify damage caused by the cold water and predict spatial spread."

Widely used multi-spectral satellite image-based approaches for burned area detection have a problem in that they do not work under cloudy conditions. Therefore, in this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Europe Space Agency, which can be collected in all weather conditions, were used to identify forest fire damaged area based on a series of processes including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. Four forest fire cases, which occurred in Gangneung·Donghae and Goseong·Sokcho in Gangwon-do of South Korea and two areas in North Korea on April 4, 2019, were examined. The estimated burned areas were evaluated using fire reference data provided by the National Institute of Forest Science (NIFOS) for two forest fire cases in South Korea, and differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) for all four cases. The average accuracy using the NIFOS reference data was 86% for the Gangneung·Donghae and Goseong·Sokcho fires. Evaluation using dNBR showed an average accuracy of 84% for all four forest fire cases. It was also confirmed that the stronger the burned intensity, the higher detection the accuracy, and vice versa. Given the advantage of SAR remote sensing, the proposed statistical processing and K-means clustering-based approach can be used to quickly identify forest fire damaged area across the Korean Peninsula, where a cloud cover rate is high and small-scale forest fires frequently occur."

Rebalancing of bikes is a criticalissue to manage BSS because the rents and returns of bikes are not balanced by stations and periods. For efficient and effective rebalancing,accurate traffic prediction is important. Recently, cluster-based traffic prediction has been utilized to enhance the accuracy of predictionat the station-level and the clustering step is very important in this approach. In this paper, we propose a k-means based clusteringalgorithm that overcomes the drawbacks of the existing clustering methods for BSS; indeterministic and hardly converged.

In such high-dimensional cases, it is common to perform tandem analysis, $K$-means cluster analysis after reducing the number of variables using dimension reduction methods. However, there is no guarantee that the reduced dimension reveals the cluster structure properly. Principal component analysis may mask the structure of clusters, especially when there are large variances for variables that are not related to cluster structure. To overcome this, techniques that perform dimension reduction and cluster analysis simultaneously have been suggested. This study proposes probabilistic reduced $K$-means, the transition of reduced $K$-means (De Soete and Caroll, 1994) into a probabilistic framework. Simulation shows that the proposed method performs better than tandem clustering or clustering without any dimension reduction. When the number of the variables is larger than the number of samples in each cluster, probabilistic reduced $K$-means show better formation of clusters than non-probabilistic reduced $K$-means. In the application to a real data set, it revealed similar or better cluster structure compared to other methods."
A New Approach for Robust Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection Using Trimmed k-Means Clustering,2021,"['Clustering', 'Trimmed k-Means', 'Sharpe Ratio', 'Robust Estimation', 'Robust Portfolio']",,"In this study, we consider the data preprocessing using trimmed k-means clustering for robust mean-variance portfolio selection. The proposed method trims the outliers in the data preprocessing stage. The optimum portfolio is formed by selecting the stock representation for each cluster using the Sharpe ratio. The optimum portfolio formation is accomplished by robust fast minimum covariance determinant (FMCD) and robust S mean-variance (MV) portfolio model. In the empirical experiment, we use fundamental trading data for the year 2017 (to form the clusters) and daily closing price data of LQ45 index stocks from August 2017 to July 2018 taken from the Indonesian Stock Exchange to form the optimum portfolio. As benchmark for portfolio performance formed in this study, we use the performance of the Indonesia Composite Index (ICI). The results reveal that the proposed method can reliably obtain the optimum portfolio and solve the outliers problem. Moreover, the comparison stage shows that the combination of trimmed k-means clustering and robust portfolio model is better in forming the optimum portfolio than the combination of k-means clustering and robust MV portfolio model. Finally, we also find that the combination of trimmed k-means clustering (with α=10%) and robust FMCD MV portfolio model outperforms portfolios produced by other methods."

Breast cancer is the most common and complex disease diagnosed among women. There are several subtypes of breast cancer and many options are there for the treatment. The most important is to educate the patients. As the research continues to expand, the understanding of the disease and its current treatments types, the researchers are constantly being updated with new researching techniques. Breast cancer survival rates have been increased with the use of new advanced treatments, largely due to the factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease.

However, due to the nature of the lamination process, there is a problem that the frequency of error occurrence may vary depending on each layer or physical cell location. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced as the number of write/erase(P/E) operations of the flash memory increases. Most flash-based storage devices such as SSDs use ECC for error correction. Since this method provides a fixed strength of data protection for all flash memory pages, it has limitations in 3D NAND flash memory, where the error rate varies depending on the physical location. Therefore, in this paper, pages and layers with different error rates are classified into clusters through the K-means machine learning algorithm, and differentiated data protection strength is applied to each cluster. We classify pages and layers based on the number of errors measured after endurance test, where the error rate varies significantly for each page and layer, and add parity data to stripes for areas vulnerable to errors to provides differentiate data protection strength. We show the possibility that this differentiated data protection policy can contribute to the improvement of reliability and lifespan of 3D NAND flash memory compared to the protection techniques using RAID-like or ECC alone."

이미지 감성분류를 위한 CNN과 K-means RGB Cluster 이-단계 학습 방안,2021,"['이미지 감성분류', '색감', '이-단계 학습', 'Sentiment Analysis of Image', 'Sense of Color', 'CNN', 'Two-stage learning']",,"The biggest reason for using a deep learning model in image classification is that it is possible to consider the relationship between each region by extracting each regions features from the overall information of the image. However, the CNN model may not be suitable for emotional image data without the images regional features. To solve the difficulty of classifying emotion images, many researchers each year propose a CNN-based architecture suitable for emotion images. Studies on the relationship between color and human emotion were also conducted, and results were derived that different emotions are induced according to color. In studies using deep learning, there have been studies that apply color information to image subtraction classification. The case where the images color information is additionally used than the case where the classification model is trained with only the image improves the accuracy of classifying image emotions.  This study proposes two ways to increase the accuracy by incorporating the result value after the model classifies an images emotion. Both methods improve accuracy by modifying the result value based on statistics using the color of the picture. When performing the test by finding the two-color combinations most distributed for all training data, the two-color combinations most distributed for each test data image were found. The result values were corrected according to the color combination distribution. This method weights the result value obtained after the model classifies an images emotion by creating an expression based on the log function and the exponential function.  Emotion6, classified into six emotions, and Artphoto classified into eight categories were used for the image data. Densenet169, Mnasnet, Resnet101, Resnet152, and Vgg19 architectures were used for the CNN model, and the performance evaluation was compared before and after applying the two-stage learning to the CNN model.  Inspired by color psychology, which deals with the relationship between colors and emotions, when creating a model that classifies an images sentiment, we studied how to improve accuracy by modifying the result values based on color. Sixteen colors were used: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple, turquoise, pink, magenta, brown, gray, silver, gold, white, and black. It has meaning. Using Scikit-learns Clustering, the seven colors that are primarily distributed in the image are checked. Then, the RGB coordinate values of the colors from the image are compared with the RGB coordinate values of the 16 colors presented in the above data. That is, it was converted to the closest color. Suppose three or more color combinations are selected. In that case, too many color combinations occur, resulting in a problem in which the distribution is scattered, so a situation fewer influences the result value. Therefore, to solve this problem, two-color combinations were found and weighted to the model. Before training, the most distributed color combinations were found for all training data images. The distribution of color combinations for each class was stored in a Python dictionary format to be used during testing. During the test, the two-color combinations that are most distributed for each test data image are found. After that, we checked how the color combinations were distributed in the training data and corrected the result. We devised several equations to weight the result value from the model based on the extracted color as described above.  The data set was randomly divided by 80:20, and the model was verified using 20% of the data as a test set.

So the accident severity was analyzed based on the side impact accidents using accident repair cost. K-means clustering analysis separated the cost of accident repair into 'minor', 'moderate', 'severe', and 'very severe'. In addition, the side impact accident severity was analyzed by using an ordered logit model. As a result, it is appeared that the longer the repair period, the greater the impact on the severity of the side impact accident. Also, it is appeared that the higher the number of collision points, the greater the impact on the severity of the side impact accident. In addition, oblique collisions of the angle of impact were derived to affect the severity of the accident less than right angle collisions. Finally, the absence of opponent vehicle and large commercial vehicles involved accidents were shown to have less impact on the side impact accident severity than passenger cars."
2단계 k-평균 군집화를 활용한 한류컨텐츠 기업 주가 예측 연구,2021,,,"This study shows that the two-stage k-means clustering method can improve prediction performance by predicting the stock price, To this end, this study introduces the two-stage k-means clustering algorithm and tests the prediction performance through comparison with various machine learning techniques. It selects the cluster close to the prediction target obtained from the k-means clustering, and reapplies the k-means clustering method to the cluster to search for a cluster closer to the actual value. As a result, the predicted value of this method is shown to be closer to the actual stock price than the predicted values of other machine learning techniques. Furthermore, it shows a relatively stable predicted value despite the use of a relatively small cluster. Accordingly, this method can simultaneously improve the accuracy and stability of prediction, and it can be considered as the new clustering method useful for small data. In the future, developing the two-stage k-means clustering is required for the large-scale data application."

At this point, the key point in responding to discrimination and hatred is the formation of continuous discourse by groups of experts (human rights activists, support groups, related researchers, etc.) and policy consistency through critical checks on national policies. The common diagnosis of specialized institutions that have studied policies, education, and alternatives to cope with discrimination, including the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, is to change the prevailing concept of discrimination in Korean society. Discrimination is a social perception structure in which discrimination is not recognized as discrimination, or recognizes discrimination because it is natural and familiar. Unlike expert's diagnosis of the situation, the government has been repeating its policy stance of emphasizing “social conventional wisdom” as a basis for compromise or compromise without trying to change “social conventional wisdom.” This contradiction not only creates a contradiction in policy, but also leads to a serious problem that the state provides a basis for justifying discrimination or legalizing discrimination incitement."

Factoring accounts receivable incurs decreased net incomes and increased cash flows in advance of due. Previous studies report that holding high cash stocks can increase liquidity, but also cause severe agency problems between managers and stockholders. Therefore, it is necessary to examine cash holdings’ value of the firms which sell accounts receivables.Empirical results are as follows. Prior to the introduction of K－IFRS, the value of cash held by an entity with loss of disposal of accounts receivables was higher than that of an entity that did not, but was not the case when foreign currency receivables or related party receivables existed. Especially, for the exporters, the value of holding cash was highly valued if they raised funds through selling accounts receivables.Since the introduction of K－IFRS, it has not been found that the value of cash held by an entity with loss of disposal of accounts receivables differs from those that do not. A decrease in the value of related party trade receivables was found, but no increase in the value of cash held was found in export companies.For the total sample of listed firms in the Korean stock market, the cash flow of the firms used factoring accounts receivables may have positive relations with the firm value. However, the firms having related party receivables decreased the positive impact of factoring on the value of cash holdings. In total, factoring can be a useful means of financing, but caution is needed when there are accounts receivables with special interested parties."

To achieve the research objectives, we empirically analyzed whether abnormal sales levels and the value relevance of sales information are changing around IFRS 15 adoption by using listed companies in Korea form 2016~2019. In this study, abnormal sales levels are estimated using annual and quartely model proposed by Subben(2010), and the value relevance model is derived on the basis of Bowen et al.(2002). The analysis yields following key. First, on the basis of abnormal sales metrics, we find that across multiple models, the level of abnormal sales has significantly decreased after IFRS 15 adoption. Second, we find that the incremental value of sales information on stock prices has increased after IFRS 15 adoption. Third, afore-mentioned results were observed differently according to the type of industries because the effect of IFRS 15 adoption may vary depending on whether the industry has applied a consistent revenue model in the past. Finally, even after IFRS 15 adoption, it was not observed that the means of sales managements were replaced from discretionary accruals to real activities such as abnormal CFO. In summary, the evidence obtained herein suggests that although the effect of IFRS 15 adoption varies in part according to the type of industries, overall, it restricts managers' opportunistic accounting choices, thereby further enhancing the usefulness of sales information. However, since we only used early periods of the IFRS 15, the result of this paper should be interpreted in a limited manner."

18K White Gold의 백색 색상 개선에 관한 연구,2021,"['화이트 골드', '알로이', '팔라듐', 'White Gold', 'Alloy', 'Palladium']","연구배경 1900년대 초반 다이아몬드 광산이 다량 발견되면서 다이아몬드와 잘 어울리는 백색 주얼리의 호황기가 시작되었다. 이로 인해 백금(Pt)을 소재로 한 주얼리는 시간이 갈수록 소비자들의 선호성이 높아졌지만, 백금의 채굴 생산은 감소하여 공급에 차질이 발생하게 된다. 이러한 백금의 대체제로 백금과 비슷한 느낌을 주는 백색 합금 금(白色 合金 金)이 상업적 목적에 의해 개발 유통된 것이 White Gold(이하 WG)의 시초다. 초기의 WG는 합금으로 사용되는 원소 금속의 종류나 함량 등이 일률적이지 않았지만, 차츰 정형화 된 WG 제작 방법이 생겨나게 되는데 그 제작 방법에 따라 니켈(Ni)계 WG와 팔라듐(Pd)계 WG 두 가지로 나눌 수 있다. 하지만 현대에서 제작되는 WG에는 니켈이나 팔라듐이 주로 사용되지 않는데, 니켈은 접촉 알러지 성분을 유발하여 신체에 해로운 영향을 끼치며 팔라듐은 가격이 폭등하여 금과 비슷한 경제적 가치를 가지고 있어 경쟁이 극심한 현대 시장에서 경제적인 가격을 제시 할 수 없기 때문이다. 그럼에도 불구하고 일부 명품 브랜드 주얼리 기업에서는 WG 주얼리에 팔라듐이나 백금을 알로이 합금 재료로 사용하여 제작하기도 한다. 이러한 방식으로 제작 된 WG는 맑은 백색을 가지게 되는데 변색의 우려가 없으며 백색 색상 도금을 하지 않아도 꾸준히 백색 색감이 유지되므로 과거의 방식을 고수한 명품 브랜드들이 재료비 상승에도 불구하고 스스로의 가치를 지켜온 것이라 볼 수 있다.연구방법 과거의 국내 팔라듐계 WG 합금 비율은 4:4:2 비율로 금 40%, 팔라듐 40%, 은과 백금 등 기타 금속의 합 20%로 제작 되었는데 주조기법이 활성화되기 이전으로 핸드메이드 방식으로 제작하고 백색 도금으로 마무리하여 판매해왔다. 이러한 방법을 기반으로 도금이 필요 없는 WG를 개발하되, 경제적 가치를 고려한 합금 알로이를 제작하고자 하였다. 40%의 금으로 제작 된 합금은 9~10K정도 되지만 본 연구에서는 가장 보편적이고 주얼리 소재로 적합한 18K 함량 한 가지에 대한 백색 색상에 대해 연구하고자 하였다. 18K는 75%의 금이 주소재이므로 나머지 25%의 알로이가 백색 색상 개선에 관한 실험 연구이다. 백색 색상을 간섭하는 금속 원소들을 최대 15%까지 알로이로 합금하여 백색 색상 개선이 이루어졌는지를 비교 분석 하였으며 그중 색상 개선이 이루어진 개체는 연마 과정을 통해서 실제 주얼리 제작시 가공에 이상이 없는지, 시간이 지날수록 변색이 일어나는지, 광내기 작업 후에도 백색 광택이 꾸준히 유지되는지 연구 하였다. 또한 고가의 알로이 재료가 사용 될 경우 경제성을 고려하여 알로이 함량을 차츰 줄여가며 제작하고, 만들어진 개체들을 비교분석 하여 최소한의 가치로 최대의 효과를 거둘 수 있는 황금비율을 제시하였다.연구결과 고가의 알로이로 인한 합금 자체의 고비용과 그로 인한 제품 가격 증대라는 단점도 존재하지만 색상개선을 통해 주얼리 제품 자체의 품질이 향상되고 불필요한 도금 지출 비용을 줄이면 소매점에서 귀금속 상품 진열에 대한 안정성을 높일 수 있게 되며, 저가의 기존 WG와 고가의 WG라는 새로운 색상의 라인업을 구성 할 수 있게 될 것이다.무엇보다 WG의 변색으로 인한 판매상의 부득이한 해명이 필요치 않아 판매성과를 높일 수 있으며 변색이 발생하지 않으므로 소비자들의 불만이 해소되어 더욱 다양한 WG 주얼리 구매에 거부감이 없어지게 될 것이다.결론 연구의 결과로 나타난 이로운 효과는 주얼리 시장 경제에 많은 도움이 될 것으로 기대가 되며, 주얼리 제조업계를 비롯한 도ㆍ소매 유통업계 등 모든 주얼리 분야에 경제적 선순환 역할을 하게 될 것으로 기대한다.","Background White color jewelrys can be said to have been booming since a large number of diamond mines were discovered in the early 1900s. However, while demand for platinum increases over time, the production of platinum decreases, causing disruptions in supply. White gold, which is similar to platinum, is developed and distributed for commercial purposes when such a platinum substitute is desperately needed. Early white gold was not uniform in the type and content of elemental metals used as alloys, Gradually, the production method of standardized white gold will be created. According to the production method, it can be divided into nickel-based white gold and palladium-based white gold. However, nickel and palladium are not commonly used in modern white gold. Nickel causes contact allergens to cause harmful effects on the body, and palladium has soaring prices that have similar economic value to gold and cannot offer economic prices in a highly competitive modern market. Nevertheless, some luxury brand jewelery companies use palladium or platinum as alloy alloys in white gold jewelry. White gold produced in this way will have a clear white color without worry of discoloration. The white color is steadily maintained even without white plating, which means that luxury brands have kept their values.Methods In the past, the palladium-based white gold alloy ratio was 4: 4: 2, which was made of 40% of gold, 40% of palladium, and 20% of other metals such as silver and platinum. Based on this method, white gold without plating was developed. And alloy alloy considering economic value was intended. Alloys made of 40% gold range from 9 to 10K, but this study attempted to study the white color of one of the most popular and jeweled 18K content. Since 18K is 75% gold, the remaining 25% alloy is the main experimental study on white color improvement. Several metal elements that induce white color are selected and alloyed with alloys up to 25%, the maximum ratio, to compare white color improvement. Among them, the subjects whose color improvements were made were studied whether or not there was any abnormality in the processing of the actual jewelry, the discoloration occurred over time, and whether the white luster was maintained even after the polishing operation. In addition, when expensive alloy material is used, it is produced by gradually reducing the alloy content in consideration of economical efficiency. By comparing and analyzing the created objects, the golden ratio that can achieve the maximum effect with the minimum value is presented.Result Such research has disadvantages such as the high cost of alloys due to expensive alloys and the resulting increase in product prices, but color improvement can improve the quality of jewelry products and reduce unnecessary plating expenses. The retailer will be able to increase the stability of the display of precious metal products and will be able to construct a new color lineup of low priced existing white gold and expensive white gold. First of all, the seller's excuses due to the discoloration of white gold are unnecessary. It can improve sales performance and resolve dissatisfaction with consumers due to no discoloration. Consumers will also buy more jewelry.Conclusion The beneficial effects of these studies are expected to be of great benefit to the jewelry market economy. It is expected to play an economic virtuous circle in all jewelry sectors, including the jewelry manufacturing industry and the wholesale and retail distribution industry."
‘K-철학’은 가능한가?,2021,"['동양철학', '한국철학', '유가', '도가', '묵가', 'K-철학', 'East-Asian Philosophy', 'Korean Philosophy', 'Confucianism', 'Mohism', 'Daoism', 'K-philosophy']","한국의 20세기에서 고전 철학의 이해는 중국이나 일본과는 차별화된 성격을 보인다. 예컨대 함석헌 등의 기독교 사상가 계열의 ‘노장’(老莊) 전통은 한편으로는 기독교와 유학, 도가의 회통을 말하면서 다른 한편으로는 민주주의와 인권, 자유와 평등의 가치를 올곧이 담아내고자 하는 철학적, 사상적 실천을 보여준다. 이 글에서 나는 이러한 실천을 규명하기 위해 세 가지에 주목하고자 했다. 첫째는 철학적 텍스트에 대한 논리적 해석에 멈추지 않고, 특정한 철학적 관념이 현실과의 상호작용 속에서 드러나는 맥락에 초점을 맞추고자 했다. 이는 ‘텍스트 철학’이 아닌 ‘느낌의 합의’ 혹은 보다 쉬운 말로 상식을 대상으로 한다는 말이다. 둘째로 나는, 이러한 목적을 위해 전문 철학자가 아닌 저자들의 텍스트에 주목했다. 김대중과 기세춘 그리고 함석헌의 텍스트를 논의의 중심에 둔 까닭이 이 때문이다. 그리고 마지막으로 나는 이러한 두 가지 논점을 포용하는 해석학적 기반을 ‘초월의 해석학’ 이라 이름 붙여 보고자 했다. 이는 특히 함석헌이 말하는 ‘씨의 자리에서 고전고쳐 읽기’는 표현을 가리키는 말이다. 엄밀한 의미에서 보면 20세기 내내 ‘동양철학’은 하나의 기호로서 혹은 식민지 경험의 유산으로 단지 허명(虛名)에 지나지 않았다. 그러나 같은 텍스트들을 비교적 관점에서 한국철학 혹은 ‘K-철학’으로 읽고자 할 때 우리는 보다 풍부한 철학적 사유의 여정을 확인할 수 있다.","Korea’s understanding of Classical philosophy in the 20th century is differentiated from those of China and Japan. In particular, the tradition of ‘old age’ of Christian thinkers such as Ham Seok-heon, on the one hand, refers to the conversion of Christianity, Confucianism, and Daoism on the one hand, while on the other hand, it aims to convey the values of democracy and human rights, freedom and equality. This is because it shows the philosophical and ideological practice of doing. In this article, I wanted to focus on three things to clarify this practice. First, I tried to focus on the context in which certain philosophical ideas are revealed in the interaction with reality, not stopping on the logical interpretation of the philosophical text. This means that it is aimed at ‘consensus of feeling’, not ‘text philosophy’, or in simpler words, common sense. Secondly, I focused on the texts of authors, not professional philosophers, for this purpose. This is why the texts of Dae-jung Kim and Se-chun Ki, and Seok-Heon Ham were put at the center of the discussion. And finally, I tried to name the hermeneutic basis that embraces these two issues as the ‘transcendental hermeneutics’. This is a word specifically referring to the expression Ham Seok-heon refers to as ‘reading revised classics in the place of ‘people’. In a strict sense, ‘Oriental Philosophy’ throughout the 20th century was nothing more than an empty name as a sign or as a legacy of colonial experience. However, when we try to read the same texts as Korean philosophy or ‘K-philosophy’ from a relatively perspective, we can find a richer journey of philosophical thinking."

Although the newly invented and discovered ""Modern Sijo"" in the early modern period fell into the category of modern literature, it was established in the realm of classical literature, not in the realm of modern literature, because it had the pre-modern form of ""external rhythm"". This was caused by the presentation of ""umsuyul(音)"" 數律 with the beat of the music genre Sijochang(時調唱) to explain the rhythm of the Modern Sijo in the formative period of the Modern Sijo, and umboyul(音譜律)"" was suggested to supplement it. However, the umboyul(音譜律) also has the risk of arbitrary interpretation, and the three-chapter structure and the longitudinal operation method of four-word repetition are the basis of the Sijo rhythm under the conditions of the umsuyul(音數律), umboyul(音譜律), and syntactic allocation. However, the special rhythm of these Modern Sijo cannot be shown in translation, but it can only be confirmed that the first line in ""English Sijo"" consists of about 15 syllables. Of course, because the syllables of the English Sijo are not negative in Korean, the Sijo eventually faced ""translational impossibility"". In response, this study tried to prove that the Modern Sijo is a literary genre specialized in Korean, and the strength and beat of Korean language contributed to the Sijo rhythm, going further from the rhythm theory of phoneme rate and phoneme rate that has been suggested. This study saw that the division of the joints is made by ""semantic strength"" within the syntactic group, and the formation of a value system creates a multilayered rhythm. However, keeping the formalities in the face of the ever-expanding and disintegrating spirit of modern times means keeping the rhythm expressed and embedded in a formal manner, which can be attributed to the uniqueness of the Korean language."

[Methods] The game factors related to referee decisions (goal, penalty kick, offside, foul, yellow card, red card, additional time) were divided into home and away team and analyzed by two-way ANOVA for 556 games before and 583 games after the VAR system was implemented. All game factors that occurred during the match and additional time were analyzed as independent t-test before and after the implementation of the VAR system. [Results] First, there was no statistically significant difference between a goal and a penalty kick. Second, the offside was significantly reduced throughout the home team, away team and the entire game(p<.001). Third, fouls were significantly reduced in home teams, away teams and the entire game (p<.01). Fourth, yellow cards were significantly reduced in both home and away teams and the entire game(p<.001). The red card increased significantly throughout the home team, away team, and the entire game(p<.001). Sixth, the additional time showed no difference the first half and the entire game, and was a little reduced in the second half (p<.05). [Conclusions] As a result of this study, players should not anticipate offside decision and stop playing in critical situations that may lead to a score or penalty kick, and continue playing until the referee makes a final decision. In addition, all red card situations are review through the VAR system, so excessive foul play or unnecessary behavior should be avoided. K-League referees are required to make a more accurate decision in the red card situation, and the time wasted by the VAR system during the game is not much."

The author took 41 songs and 143 translated versions of an idol group named WINNER as examples and compared and analyzed those samples and stated the outcomes. The main outcomes are as follows.  In China, the versions of translated lyrics could be mainly divided in official translations which are from QQMUSIC and NETEASE CLOUD MUSIC and fans’ translations. As for QQMUSIC, this company has several professional translation teams, however as for NETEASE CLOUD MUSIC, this company does not have any translation teams so the translations are mainly from the users. Fans’ translations are mainly from BAIDU online communities. The fans need to cooperate the activities of the singers so they have to translate the lyrics as soon as possible in order to synchronize the activities. In comparison, the quality of translations from QQMUSIC is satisfactory and correct. There exists many literal translations and unnatural translations among fans’ translated versions. The author discovered many critical translation errors in both official translations and fans’ translations. These critical errors contains confounding the relationship between certain and deny, confounding the main language and guest language, missing contents of lyrics and logic errors between texts et cetera.  It is generally recognized that the translation of lyrics is an assistant method of understanding songs so that the lyrics will not be modified after publishing even users discovered some errors, neither official translations nor fans’ translations. So the users are tend to understand the meanings of songs rather than the accuracy of the translations. In order to solve this problem, it is significant to establish the system of translation and proofreading as soon as possible. Therefore the people who work in translation-related professions should reform their cognition in translating lyrics fundamentally."

This research explores how the popularity of Korean pop culture (Hanryu) complicates the construction of fashion identity of Chinese consumers and how their consumption restructures clothing production of Dongdaemun Fashion Market (DFM) in Seoul. Throughout the 2000s, the waning DFM has been revived by increased exports to China and other Asian countries, as well as more visits by international consumers looking for K-fashion, who are intrigued by the cultural consumption of Hanryu. Beyond the surface of consumption, however, hidden/invisible circuits of clothing production and consumption exist through transnational mediascapes. Many Chinese have emerged as important players in terms of retailers/producers who interlink fashion industries between Korea and China. In this context, there is no essential correspondence between particular commodities, national or local identities. By examining the transnational/transcultural fashion routes centered on DFM, this research traces the shifting boundaries of fashion identity and the specific fashion geographies of consumption and production within the inter-Asian context."

In today’s trans-national world, a diaspora’s hybrid identity plays a positive role in handling ‘global discourse’. First, this study investigates the fundamental meaning of a diaspora and Homi K. Bhabha’s hybridity, which explains the doctrine of creating a cultural boundary from a postcolonial perspective. Second, it derives two antagonistic cultures through the flow of aesthetic knowledge and design in a multifaceted perspective, such as art and philosophical concept, considering the confusion resulting from cultural conflicts as an aesthetic attribute of ‘opening’. Third, this study is significant in that it expresses the inner world of a diaspora, reflecting hybridity as a new form of bonding through the human body, taking Homi Bhabha’s third space as the creative space of cultural heredity. The ultimate goal of this study is to prove that body art can be transformed into a new form of formative art by converging open thinking about art/beauty elements and performing differentiated studies. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the study results would help set a direction for body art, taking the diaspora’s hybridity as an aspect for interdisciplinary studies across art, culture, and philosophy from a convergence perspective."

We assessed the feasibility and clinical relevance of frailty status in Korean older inpatients using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and Korean version of the Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illnesses, & Loss of Weight scale (K-FRAIL) questionnaires.Methods: Frailty status was measured using the Korean-translated version of the CFS and K-FRAIL questionnaire within 3 days from admission in 144 consecutive patients aged 60 years or older. The correlation between CFS and K-FRAIL score was assessed. The criterion validity of CFS was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. As outcomes, delirium, bedsore, length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, and unplanned 30-day readmission were measured by reviewing medical records.Results: The mean age of the study population was 70.1 years (range, 60 to 91), and 75 (52.1%) were men. By linear regression analysis, CFS and K-FRAIL were positively correlated (B = 0.72, p < 0.001). A CFS cutoff of ≥ 5 maximized sensitivity + specificity to classify frailty using K-FRAIL as a reference (C-index = 0.893). Higher frailty burden by both CFS and K-FRAIL was associated with higher LOS and bedsores. Unplanned readmission and in-hospital mortality were associated with higher CFS score but not with K-FRAIL score, after adjusting for age, gender, polypharmacy, and multimorbidity.Conclusions: Frailty status by CFS was associated with LOS, bedsores, unplanned readmission, and in-hospital mortality. CFS can be used to screen high-risk patients who may benefit from geriatric interventions and discharge planning in acutely hospitalized older adults."

First of all, Yijing thought which the Taegeukgi contains, is not an exclusive property of a particular country or nation, but a universal philosophy of Northeast Asia. The owner's qualifications are not based on origin, but on the narrative that has been embodied in life and history. The complementary thinking of yin and yang, love of life, resistance to anti-life violence, and humanitarianism are consistent from Dangun mythology, to Choe Chi-won's Pungnyudo, Neo-Confucianism, Donghak's ""people are the heaven."", and Jumgyerk. The representative symbol is the Taegeukgi. Koreans have lived their lives by deeply internalizing the idea of Taegeukgi. Today, when people around the world recognize the symbol of Korea as the Taegeuk mark, the representative of the Taegeukgi ideology is definitely Korea. Korean society, which has miraculously achieved material prosperity despite the colonial invasion, the Korean War, and the crisis of the IMF, is about to achieve a second miracle in terms of mental culture. As the core of Korea's long-standing history, the Yingyang thinking of the Taegeukgi is an excellent framework to explain Korea's potential for overcoming many crises. It contains humanistic values that must be recalled in seeking a K-philosophy that can spread beyond Korean society to universal values of mankind."

CSBD 관련 문제는 특정 민족이나 문화권에 국한되지 않으며 범국가적 관심을 요구하지만, 현재까지의 연구 대다수는 서구권을 중심으로 수행되었다. 국내 CSBD 관련 연구를 촉진하기 위한 첫걸음으로, 본 연구는 ICD-11 진단지침을 토대로 개발된 CSBD 선별척도인 CSBD-19를 한국어로 번안 및 타당화하였다. 참여자는 온라인으로 표집된 성인 404명(남 179, 여 225)이었으며 연령 범위는 19∼69세였다(M=45.01, SD=13.54). 확인적 요인분석 결과 선행연구에서 제안된 5요인(통제, 현저성, 재발, 불만족, 부정적 결과) 모형은 본 연구의 한국인 참여자들에게도 적합한 것으로 나타났다. K-CSBD-19 전체 척도 및 하위요인들의 내적 합치도 또한 양호한 수준이었고(전체 척도=.938, 하위요인=.712∼.898), 기존에 개발된 유관 척도와의 공인 타당도 역시 확보되었다. 다음으로 CSBD 고위험군 식별을 위한 절단점을 탐색하고자 잠재프로파일분석 및 ROC 분석을 수행하였으며, 표본의 3.7%가 고위험군으로 분류되고 이들을 식별하는 최적 절단점은 48.5점으로 제안되었다. 끝으로 본 연구의 의의와 한계점을 논하고 후속연구를 제언하였다.","Compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD) is now included as an impulse control disorder in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11). CSBD-related problems require global attention as they are not limited to a particular ethnic group or culture. The majority of prior studies have been conducted in western societies. As a first step towards stimulating CSBD research in Korea, we translated and validated CSBD-19, a recently developed screening measure of CSBD, into Korean. The subjects were 404 adults (179 men and 225 women) ranging in age from 19 to 69 years old (mean age=45.01, standard deviation=13.54). The results of confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a five-factor (control, salience, relapse, dissatisfaction, negative consequences) model proposed in a previous study was fit for the current data. Internal consistency coefficient of the Korean version of CSBD-19 (K-CSBD-19) were also good (total items=.938, sub-domains=.712~.898). The results of concurrent validity analysis showed that K-CSBD-19 was positively correlated with the existing scales of related variables. Next, latent profile analysis and receiver operating characteristic analysis were conducted to calculate cut-off points for classifying individuals at high risk of CSBD. We identified a high-risk group of 3.7 percent of the total samples, and a score of 48.5 was proposed as an optimal cut-off point. Lastly, theoretical and practical implications as well as the limitations of this study were discussed."
중수골 기저부 및 경부 골절에서 K-강선을 이용하여 만든 Staple 고정술의 치료 결과,2021,"['Metacarpal fracture', 'Neck', 'Base', 'Staple', 'Open reduction', '중수골 골절', '경부골절', '기저부골절', '스테이플러', '해부학적 정복']",,"Purpose: This study was designed to evaluate the radiological and clinical outcomes of a new surgical technique―customized staple fixation using K-wire―in displaced metacarpal neck or base fractures.Materials and Methods: From November 2016 to May 2017, 13 unstable metacarpal neck and base fractures (10 patients) were treated with II-shaped customized K-wire staples fixation, after performing open reductions through minimal dorsal incisions. The radiological and clinical outcomes were retrospectively evaluated.Results: A mean of 2.6 staples were used for each fracture fixation. Preoperative angulation of 36.3° was reduced to 3.1° postoperatively. A week after surgery, the volar short arm splint was replaced with a dorsal splint to initiate active range of motion exercise, and the splint was subsequently removed after 3 weeks. The radiologic union was achieved at a mean of 5.1 weeks, and total active motion was recovered at a mean of 7.4 weeks. On a mean, K-wire staples were removed at 16.5 weeks after the surgery, and the mean treatment took 18.6 weeks. At the final follow-up (at mean 27.3 weeks), no significant difference was observed for total active motion of the digits and grip strength, when compared to the contralateral hand. Complete union was achieved in all fractures without deformity, or complications such as infection or nerve injury. All patients were satisfied with the cosmetic and functional outcomes.Conclusion: K-wire stapling is an effective alternative modality in treating unstable displaced metacarpal neck or base fractures. It requires minimal incision to enable open reduction. In addition, early mobilization is ensured through the rigid fixations. Moreover, it prevents postoperative joint stiffness and reduces the time needed for treatment."

We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes according to the antibiotic regimens and identify risk factors for mortality in patients with KPC-producing K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli bacteremia.Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all adult patients with monomicrobial bacteremia (KPC-producing K. pneumoniae or E. coli) between January 2011 and March 2021 at a 2,700-bed tertiary center.Results: Ninety-two patients were identified; 7 with E. coli bacteremia, and 85 with K.pneumoniae bacteremia. Thirty-day mortality was 38.0% (35/92). Non-survivors were more likely to have had nosocomial infection (88.6% vs. 63.2%, P = 0.01), high APACHE II scores (mean [interquartile range], 22.0 [14.0 - 28.0] vs. 14.0 [11.0 - 20.5], P <0.001), and septic shock (51.4% vs. 26.3%, P <0.001) and less likely to have been admitted to the surgical ward (5.7% vs. 22.8%, P = 0.04), undergone removal of eradicable foci (61.5% vs. 90.6%, P = 0.03), and received appropriate combination treatment (57.1% vs. 78.9%, P = 0.03) than survivors.No significant difference in mortality was observed according to combination regimens including colistin, aminoglycoside, and tigecycline. In multivariable analysis, high APACHE II scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 - 1.23, P <0.001), and appropriate definitive treatment (aOR, 0.25; CI, 0.08 - 0.74, P = 0.01) were independent risk factors for mortality.Conclusion: High APACHE II scores and not receiving appropriate definitive treatment were associated with 30-day mortality. Mortality did not significantly differ according to combination regimens with conventional drugs such as aminoglycoside and colistin."

Perhaps what will be most exciting to scholars of Buddhist literature is the news that this edition of the Sanskrit text reports the readings of a palm-leaf manuscript that preserves the complete work in the original language, one of two palm-leaf manuscripts kept at Drepung Monastery to have recently come to light. The edition also takes into account previous scholarship on Kṣemendra’s version of the story. A dynamic English translation attempts to convey some sense of the meaning and poetry of the original, and thereby to extend knowledge within a broader literary and historical context, and makes the argument that the primary source for Kṣemendra’s retelling is the version of the Great Miracle story found in the Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinaya.

The Role of ‘Political Trust’ in Science Communication: Focusing on ‘K-Quarantine Evaluation’ on COVID 19,2021,"['COVID 19', 'K-Quarantine evaluation', 'political trust', 'support for Moon government', 'science communication']",,"Public evaluation of national policy acts as an important factor in maintaining or replacing the government in the upcoming election. The same is true of scientific policy evaluations, including high-tech and medical care. In the face of the COVID-19 crisis, the national evaluation of “K-Quarantine” in the medical science field can also serve as an important variable in the operation of the democratic system. 1) How do sovereign citizens evaluate “K-Quarantine”? 2) How much influence does the ‘political trust’ factor have in the scientific communication of COVID-19 and ‘K-Quarantine’ evaluation? 1,000 citizens participated in an internet survey and the results were analyzed.The mean score of “K-Quarantine Evaluation” was 5.595 out of 10, indicating that the public holds a slightly positive view on “K-Quarantine”. Research Hypothesis 1 states that “The more people support Moon Jae’s government, the more positively they will evaluate ‘K-Quarantine’”. After conducting regression analysis on the survey result, it was found that the evaluation of “K-Quarantine” also increased as the “political trust” of “Moon Jae in government support” increased. Research hypothesis 1 was supported by the survey. Research Hypothesis 2 states that “support for Moon Jae’s government” will have a greater influence on the “K-Quarantine evaluation”, which is more controversial than those with less debates in the public sphere such as “tracking the path of confirmed patients”. Four less controversial dependent variables were “vaccine stability”, “tracking the path of confirmed patients”, “QR certification”, and “smart city surveillance society” Regression analysis conducted on the data showed that the “political trust” variable of “support for Moon Jae’s government” had greater influence on “K-Quarantine evaluation” than the other four dependent variables. Research hypothesis 2 was also supported.The results were consistent with the effect of national gathering that the people support the government and its leaders in times of national crisis.

데이터마이닝을 이용한 공군 F-15K 수리부속 예측모형에 관한 연구,2021,"['Data Mining', 'Demand Forecasting', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'Feature Engineering', 'F-15K']","군에서 사용하고 있는 수리부속은 약 72만 종으로, 국방 예산의 약 3%(약 1.3조원)을 차지하고 있으며, 적시적기의 수리부속 보급은 무기체계 전투준비태세에 직접적인 영향을 미치고 있어 수리부속 수요예측은 예산 운영과 장비 가동률 측면에서 매우 중요한 요소가 되고 있다. 그래서 현재 공군에서 적용 중인 시계열 모형의 예측한계를 개선하기 위해 다수의 연구들이 데이터마이닝 중 지도학습을 통한 새로운 외부변수를 추가하여 예측률을 향상시키는데 집중하였고, 비지도학습과 피쳐 엔지니어링을 통한 예측 정확도 향상 연구는 한정되어 있었다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 수리부속 수요예측 정확도 제고를 위해 공군에서 운용중인 F-15K 전투기에 대한 2014 ~ 2019년까지의 5,752개 수리부속 품목의 소모개수와 표준단가 데이터 수집하였고, 데이터마이닝 모형(Random forest, GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net regression)을 활용하여 시계열모형과 예측률을 비교하였다. 예측력척도는 RMSE (평균제곱근오차)를 사용하였다. 연구결과 데이터마이닝 모형이 현재 공군에서 적용중인 시계열 예측 모형에 비해 예측정확도가 높았으며, 이어서 비지도학습의 차원축소와 피쳐 엔지니어링을 통해 예측정확도를 더욱 높일 수 있었다.","The military uses approximately 720,000 kinds of repair parts, accounting for approximately 3% (~ 1.3 trillion won) of the defense budget. The timely supply of repair parts has a direct impact on weapons systems. Therefore, a demand forecast for repair parts has become a very important factor in terms of budget and equipment utilization. To improve the prediction limits with the time series model currently being applied in the Airforce, several studies focused on improving the prediction rates by adding new external variables through supervised learning. Research on improving the predictive accuracy through unsupervised learning and feature engineering has been limited. In this study, the consumption and standard unit price data of 5,752 repair accessory items from 2014 to 2019 were collected for F-15K fighter jets operated by the Airforce. In this study, the data-mining model (Randomforest, GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet regression) was used to compare the time series models with the prediction rate. The predictive power scale was RMSE (mean square root error). This study showed that data mining models have higher prediction accuracy than the time series prediction model currently applied in the Airforce. In addition, dimensionality reduction and feature engineering improve the prediction accuracy further."

This data will facilitate more accurate detection and follow-up of the risk of mild cognitive impairment in this population, taking into consideration age and education. Future studies are required that should focus on the cut-off score on the level of education according to age."
A Network Meta-Analysis Comparing Osteoporotic Fracture among Different Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Vitamin K Antagonists in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation,2021,"['Atrial fibrillation', 'Factor Xa inhibitors', 'Network meta-analysis', 'Osteoporotic fractures', 'Vitamin K']",,"Background: There are limited studies comparing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures between different direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Using a network meta-analysis (NMA), we compared osteoporotic fractures among 5 different treatment arms, viz. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and VKA. Methods: Ten studies, including 5 randomized control trials and 5 population-based studies, with a total of 321,844 patients (148,751 and 173,093 in the VKA and DOAC group, respectively) with a median follow-up of 2 years, were included. A Bayesian random-effects NMA model comparing fractures among the treatment arms was performed using MetInsight V3. Sensitivity analysis excluded studies with the highest residual deviances from the NMA model. Results: The mean age of the patients was 70 years. The meta-analysis favored DOACs over VKA with significantly lower osteoporotic fracture (odds ratio [OR], 0.77; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.70-0.86).The NMA demonstrated that fractures were significantly lower with apixaban compared with dabigatran (OR, 0.64; 95% CrI, 0.44-0.95); however, fractures were statistically similar between apixaban and rivaroxaban (OR, 0.84; 95% CrI, 0.58-1.24) and dabigatran and rivaroxaban (OR, 1.32; 95% CrI, 0.90-1.87). Based on the Bayesian model of NMA, the probability of osteoporotic fracture was highest with VKA and lowest with apixaban, followed by rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran. Conclusions: The decision to prescribe anticoagulants in elderly patients with AF should be made not only based on thrombotic and bleeding risks but also on the risk of osteoporotic fracture; these factors should be considered and incorporated in contemporary cardiology practice."

In this regard, each country is implementing a variety of policies on border management systems, analyzing factors that endanger security, and spreading infectious diseases. The problem of illegal migration between countries causes confusion in the legal order of the receiving country due to the increase in refugee and foreign crimes. In addition, there is a possibility of social division due to increased antipathy towards foreigners, and the possibility of terrorism caused by the entry of international terrorist organizations and domestic activities is mainly dealt with as a security issue. In Korea, the embassy in Afghanistan allowed the humanitarian stay of the people who were friendly. Nevertheless, our country is in a situation where international politics, geographical problems, and military problems are compressed. Therefore, it is necessary to respond to the adverse function of illegal immigration through effective border management.

Based on 『Shishuoxinyu(世說新語)』 and Zhi’s 「Daxiaopin duibi yaochao xu(大小品對比要抄序)」, however, Jeuksekui can be viewed as an explanation of Saek(色) through Myeongsang(名想) as a cognitive process. Thus, one can claim that what he ultimately aims at is the reduction to Bonmu(本無). Moreover, the meaning of Zhi’s Bonmu can be viewed as Gong(空) in the meaning that it lies outside personal awareness called Musim(無心), which has the same meaning as Jiin’s merits. Zhi Daolin’s Jiin refers to the subject of Soyo(逍遙) attained through Musim. In this sense, Jiin can be seen as a development of the Taoist view of the virtuous person because it not only refers to Guo Xiang’s Mang(忘) but also does not rule out the proactiveness of ordinary people.As such, Zhi Daolin’s Jiin is the subject of Soyo that knows being satisfied (Jijok: 至足) through Musim and is spoken of through the idea of the Imperishable Spirit. The concept of Jiin as spirit, which was posited in early Chinese Buddhism to explain samsara and karma, and which is related to the idea of the immortality of spirit, is similar to the expression of spirit as manifested in Lushan Huiyuan’s theory of practice. Huiyuan regarded the subject of practice as the attainer of wisdom and construes Dharma-Kāya as the sole existence of spirit that has left the body of Lei (累). The similarity between Huiyuan’s Dharma-Kāya and Zhi Daolin’s Jiin shows that Buddhism during the time of the Eastern Jin understood the main body of Buddhist practice and the ultimate attainer through spirit.Therefore, this paper assumes that the true meaning of Zhi’s Jeuksekui lies in the reduction to Bonmu through the Musim of Jiin and shows that the Jiin that is attained to the level of Soyo is an idea directly related to the meaning of Dharma-Kāya."

This Act states that the executive government can review and reduce appropriations of the budget of other constitutional branches such as the judiciary and legislature after hearing the other branches' opinion regarding their own appropriation.In the US, where the principle of separation of powers is a major principle of the constitution, the legislative branch has all authority about the U.S. budget by the U.S. Constitution.

Furthermore, 31 US Code §1105(b), which is the federal law on budget proposals, states that “Estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations for the legislative branch and the judicial branch to be included in each budget...shall be submitted to President...and included in the budget by President without change”.For my study, I conducted a thorough research on the US Code § 1105(b) by analyzing the literature, historical background, interviewing some Constitutional law experts.The historical root of the US Code §1105(b) can be found in the Administrative Office Act of 1939(Act of 1939), enacted by the US Congress. Before enacting Act of 1939, the executive government took a charge of judiciary's administration. The Act of 1939 was enacted on the premise of consensus on the principles of separation of powers and independence of the judiciary. Attorney General stated for Act of 1939 in Congress that “I believe, too, that there is something inherently illogical to the current system, having the budget and expenditure of the courts and individual judges under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice. The court should be an independent, coordinating branch of the Government in every proper sense of term.” As the Act of 1939 was enacted, the executive branch was excluded from all judicial administration, including judiciary's appropriation of budget.I believe that the U.S.'s above system, elaborated above, can help us understand the meaning of ROK's Constitution §54(2).We need to understand that the constitutional branches of governments' appropriations of budget are different from those of agencies under the executive branch. it goes against main principles of constitution like separation of powers and independence of the judiciary to understand that 'the executive government can review and change the other branches' appropriations of budget'.Therefore, ROK's National Finance Act §40 should be amended as soon as possible so that “The judiciary and other constitutional branches' appropriations of budget shall be included in the budget by the executive government without change,” following the US system."

In the current, when estimating traffic demand, use AAWDT (Annual Average WeekDay Traffic) estimated from household traffic survey sample data to estimate traffic pattern by applying the ratio of peak and non-peak vehicle trip. However, it is thought that estimating the concentration ratio of roads with uniform rate of peak and non-peak regardless of travel distance (travel time) to analyze the network path will differ significantly from the actual traffic patterns. This study proposes a more realistic method of estimating by reflecting the traffic patterns which difference in peak and non-peak time due to differences in departure time by distance using actual measurement data of navigation. in the network analysis. This study use SK T-map data, which has the highest share of navigation service in Korea, of 261 day on weekdays during one year. SAS (statistical package program) and RapidMiner (data mining platform) were used as analysis tools to construct k-means clustering. Based on actual navigation data, interregional travel distance was divided into seven groups to have similar characteristics, and the average traffic rate was calculated by the distance groups. By grouping and simplifying similar traffic patterns such as peak, non-peak and night using 24-hours traffic concentration rate data from derived seven distance group, a study was conducted on how to most realistically express traffic patterns. In other word, using the 24-hour traffic concentration rate of seven distance groups, through the k-means clustering analysis from k=2 to k=5, the time zone with similar traffic pattern of concentration was divided into one group. The results of BIC, Elbow, Silhouette, correlation coefficient analysis by k-means clustering result, slope, and value of non-segmented simple regression model were compared according to k value. As a result of this study, it was found that it is best to classified traffic pattern by time into three groups. In addition, it proposed a method of building OD data to enable network analysis that reflected the classification of travel distance and traffic concentration ratio patterns obtained from the research results. It is expected that a more realistic analysis of the traffic patterns of time bands on roads where short, medium and long distance traffic is mixed when performing a traffic assignment based on OD data which reflecting differences in departure time by travel distance."

As a result of the study, it was confirmed that there was a positive (＋) significant correlation between the difference in the Notes by company－year and the information usefulness measured by the absolute value of Cumulative Abnormal Return. This means that the investor found the new information obtained from the Notes useful. Next, it was confirmed that the company－year difference in the Notes increased after the fully adoption of K－IFRS, and it was found that the company－year difference in the Notes by companies that voluntarily adopted K－IFRS was larger than that of companies that mandatorily adopted K－IFRS. As the preparers’ discretion was expanded by the principle－based accounting standards, the information usefulness of the Notes was improved by the adoption of K－IFRS, and in the case of companies that adopted mandatorily, compliance with disclosure regulations was more focused."

Enhancing Clustering Algorithm with Initial Centroids in Tool Wear Region Recognition,2021,['Semi-supervised learning · Clustering · Tool wear region · Statistical analysis · Z-rot'],,"Autonomous manufacturing allows the system to distinguish between a mild, normal and total failure in tool condition. K-means clustering has become the most applied algorithm in discovering classes in an unsupervised scenario. Nevertheless, the algorithm is sensitive to the initial centroids giving various solution every time the system updating. Regular unsupervised K-means is refocused as semi-supervised Fixum K-means. It is embedded with a new tactic to recapture the K value and new initial seedings computation to kick off the system until it converges. Force components of cutting force F c , thrust force F t and perpendicular cutting force F cn were extracted from Neo-MoMac cutting force measurement device. The analysis threshold represents a natural-sorted input vector as Z -rot coefficient ( R Z ) corresponds to the number of cutting accomplish a strong correlation ( R 2 = 0.8511) over wear evolution. The clustering system adopted a new calculation of initial centroids has successfully determined the three regions for only a single assignment and achieving the optimal distance squared through eight given data sets. It is conflicting with the standard K-means that return different clustering structure in each run, while K-means + + replicates several times to achieve minimum objective function. During the course, F-Km delivered robust and consistence clustering results of 85% accuracy over standard K-means and four times converges faster than K-means + + . The silhouette value average score is 0.8504 (highest score is 0.9207) of how well-distributed the resulting clusters. The clustering system has identified the tool to stop cutting at approximate VB = 0.213 mm before the tool condition enters the failure region of abnormal phase ( VB < 0.250 mm ).s The proposed system functioned effectively in clustering the data obtained from cutting tests performed within a reasonable range of wear stages. Precision and robustness analysis have proved F-km to score 100% attainment for clustering assignment output and replicability. In contrast, K-means scored 76.3% for precision and ranging from 5 to 33% for robustness. Whereas, K-means + + scored 33% for robustness and a higher chance of time complexity compared to F-km. F-Km is found to be more accurate, time savvy and robust than standard K-means and K-means + + . Therefore, the method can be reliably used for observing tool wear state recognition without training and equivocate traditional direct tool wear."

However, to perform several tasks such as detection, tracking, and identification of persons in video data, it is an essential step to develop an algorithm specifically using a distributed network. For this purpose, numerous techniques have been developed in the field of computer vison for single-view images/video analysis. However, overviewing the literature of video data analytics, the techniques for multi-view analysis are missing on extreme level. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method for person re-identification and tracking in multi-view images through hybrid approach of several techniques that are usually applied for a single-view image. At first, we generate our own dataset and pass the images into a preprocessing step to detect person using YOLO and subtract the background through Mask-RCNN. Next, the color features are extracted from the images which are fed into K-mean clustering algorithm. We introduce a novel distancing formula by adding weights to Bhattacharyya’s distance to measure the similarity between the clusters of two multi-view input images. The conducted experiments verify and confirm the affectiveness of the proposed method by obtaining 86.23 average precision."

In this study, we propose a system that can prevent school violence by analyzing data on the frequency of conversations between students, friendship and preference to be in the same group. This data was quantified using a Likert scale questionnaire, and also grouped into the appropriate number of clusters using the K-means algorithm. Additionally, the homeroom teacher observed the frequency and nature of conversations between students, and targeted specific individuals or groups for counseling and intervention, with the aim of reducing school violence. Data analysis revealed that the teachers' qualitative observations were consistent with the quantified data based on student questionnaires, and therefore applicable as quantitative data towards the identification and understanding of student relationships within the classroom. The study has potential limitations. The data used is subjective and based on peer evaluations which can be inconsistent as the students may use different criteria to evaluate one another.

A New Hybrid Approach of Clustering Based Probabilistic Decision Tree to Forecast Wind Power on Large Scales,2021,['Wind power forecast  · K-means clustering  · NB tree  · Machine learning  · Windfarm'],,"The wind power forecasting plays a vital role in renewable energy production. Due to the dynamic and uncertain behavior of wind, it is really hard to catch the actual features of wind for accurate forecasting measures. The patchy and instability of wind leading to the assortment of training samples have a main infl uence on the forecasting accuracy. For this purpose, an accurate forecasting method is needed. This paper proposed a new hybrid approach of clustering based probabilistic decision tree to forecast wind power effi ciently. The collected data is screened for noisy information and selected those variables which mainly contribute in accurate predictions. Then, the wind data is normalized using mean and standard deviation to extract playing level fi elds for each feature. Based on the similarity of the data behavior, the K-means clustering algorithm is applied to classify the samples into diff erent groups which contain the historical wind data. Further, the Naïve Bayes (NB) tree is proposed to extract probabilities for each feature in the clusters. The NB tree is a hybrid model of C4.5 and NB methods that successfully applied on three big real-world wind datasets (hourly, monthly, yearly) collected from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The forecasting accuracy exposed that the proposed method could forecast an accurate wind power from hours to years’ data. Comprehensive comparisons are made of the proposed method with the most popular state of the art techniques which show that this method provides more accurate prediction results."

Together with data preparation, such as the analysis of time-series patterns and well-formulated features, clustering methods can be used to specify group-based energy consumption data. Hence, we propose to use k-Means and agglomerative clustering, which adapt to the time-series data for grouped apartments. Then, robust gradient boosting is implemented to predict the levels of energy consumption for each group. Finally, prediction of energy consumption for the whole building is estimated. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the method allows significantly fewer errors than previous techniques."
An expanded Matrix Factorization model for real-time Web service QoS prediction,2021,"['Real-time QoS prediction', 'matrix factorization', 'clustering', 'K-means']",,"Real-time prediction of Web service of quality (QoS) provides more convenience for web services in cloud environment, but real-time QoS prediction faces severe challenges, especially under the cold-start situation. Existing literatures of real-time QoS predicting ignore that the QoS of a user/service is related to the QoS of other users/services. For example, users/services belonging to the same group of category will have similar QoS values. All of the methods ignore the group relationship because of the complexity of the model. Based on this, we propose a real-time Matrix Factorization based Clustering model (MFC), which uses category information as a new regularization term of the loss function. Specifically, in order to meet the real-time characteristic of the real-time prediction model, and to minimize the complexity of the model, we first map the QoS values of a large number of users/services to a lower-dimensional space by the PCA method, and then use the K-means algorithm calculates user/service category information, and use the average result to obtain a stable final clustering result. Extensive experiments on real-word datasets demonstrate that MFC outperforms other state-of-the-art prediction algorithms."

Through the analysis of requirements specification, a standard technical Korean(STK) has been established in the domain of the railway vehicle system. Based upon STK, this paper also derives a type of templates for the guideline of requirements specification. A variety of templates in the railway vehicle system domain are fed into the input of unsupervised machine learning algorithms as training instances. The clustering models in an unsupervised way classify the templates into a several clusters. Our system that verifies the soundness of requirements specification has been developed in the basis of clusters. The system we have developed makes a new sentence of specification belonged into one of groups, and then, if it finds the identical template in a specific cluster, it confirms the new specification as a sound one. Otherwise, it autonomically returns the most similar template recommended by k-means clustering algorithm. We have tested our system to verify both cases. In the experiment, no matter what a new sentence exists in the knowledge base of templates, it turns out that our robust system confirms whether or not the new sentence is correctly written, based upon the clusters, and further provides the most similar template as being updated for the correct specification."

In this case, financial performance was defined as the net sales growth rate and the rate of operating profits, and was clustered through K-means clustering analysis. The resulting cluster of financial performance was again applied to the analysis of covariance to confirm whether significance was maintained even when the covariates were controlled. As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that there was a significant difference in the industrial technology classification cluster even when the size of innovative SMEs was controlled. In particular, 18 industrial technology classifications were classified as financial performance superior technologies in both the start-up and non-start-up companies, and it was confirmed that the proportion of medicine⋅biotechnology was relatively high. Through this, it was concluded that there is a significant difference in financial performance depending on the technology possessed, which is the intrinsic attribute of innovative SMEs. In addition, the necessity of the government's industrial policy and SME promotion policy reflecting the attributes related to the technology possessed by innovative SMEs was suggested."
Prediction of ship power based on variation in deep feed-forward neural network,2021,"['Ship power prediction', 'Preprocessing', 'Deep learning', 'Deep feed-forward neural network (DFN)', 'Hyperparameter optimization', 'K-means clustering']",,"Fuel oil consumption (FOC) must be minimized to determine the economic route of a ship; hence, the ship power must be predicted prior to route planning. For this purpose, a numerical method using test results of a model has been widely used. However, predicting ship power using this method is challenging owing to the uncertainty of the model test. An onboard test should be conducted to solve this problem; however, it requires considerable resources and time. Therefore, in this study, a deep feedforward neural network (DFN) is used to predict ship power using deep learning methods that involve data pattern recognition. To use data in the DFN, the input data and a label (output of prediction) should be configured. In this study, the input data are configured using ocean environmental data (wave height, wave period, wave direction, wind speed, wind direction, and sea surface temperature) and the ship's operational data (draft, speed, and heading). The ship power is selected as the label. In addition, various treatments have been used to improve the prediction accuracy. First, ocean environmental data related to wind and waves are preprocessed using values relative to the ship's velocity. Second, the structure of the DFN is changed based on the characteristics of the input data. Third, the prediction accuracy is analyzed using a combination comprising five hyperparameters (number of hidden layers, number of hidden nodes, learning rate, dropout, and gradient optimizer). Finally, k-means clustering is performed to analyze the effect of the sea state and ship operational status by categorizing it into several models. The performances of various prediction models are compared and analyzed using the DFN in this study."

K강선은 1개(1.6 mm), 2개(1.1 mm), 또는 3개(0.9 mm)를 사용하여 수술하였다.방사선 검사에서 골 유합을 확인하였고, K강선 제거 기간, 수술시간, total active motion (TAM), 골수강 내 직경, 중수골의 수술 전후 길이 단축 및 각 변형을 분석하였다. 다섯 번째 중수골의 각 형성 측정에는 Medullary Canal-lateral view 방법을, 길이 단축에 대해서는 Shortening Stipulated 방법을 사용하였다. 골수강 내 직경은 방사선 사진 관상면의 다섯 번째 중수골 몸통 중간 부위에서 측정하였다. TAM은 퇴원 후 외래에서 측정하였다.결과: 모든 환자가 골 유합을 보였고, 다른 임상 및 방사선학적 변수는 고정한 K강선의 개수에 따른 유의한 통계적 차이가 없었으나 수술시간은 1개의 K강선을 사용한 그룹에서 가장 짧았다.결론: K강선의 개수에 따른 수술 및 수술 후 결과는 통계적 차이가 없었다. 즉, 1개의 K강선을 사용하더라도 안정적인 고정을 얻을 수 있으므로 집도의의 선호도에 따라 1개의 두꺼운 K강선을 골수강 내에 삽입하여 수술하는 것도 한 대안이 될 수 있다.","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological results of patients with fifth metacarpal neck fractures using different sizes and numbers of Kirschner wires (K-wire). Methods: A single institutional retrospective review identified 67 patients with a fifth metacarpal neck fracture between January 2015 and July 2020. The minimum follow-up time was 6 months and they were all treated within 6.4 days of the initial injury. Either one K-wire (1.6 mm), two K-wires (1.1 mm), or three K-wires (0.9 mm) was used. We analyzed the bone union period, and K-wire removal period, duration of surgery, total active motion, intramedullary diameter, pre/postoperative shortening, and pre/postoperative angulation clinically. We used a Method of Shortening Stipulated to measure shortening and the Medullary Canal-lateral view method for angulation. The intramedullary diameter was measured in the mid-shaft of the fifth metacarpal bone in the coronal view. Total active motion was measured at the time of follow-up in our outpatient department. Results: Clinical and radiological parameters showed no statistically significant differences. Even though it did not present a statistical significance, the absolute mean duration of surgery was the shortest in a single K-wire group. Conclusion: The clinical and radiological outcomes of surgery were comparable regardless of the number of K-wires inserted. However, we could look forward to gaining potential benefit from shortened operation time in a single K-wire group. Since stable fixation can be obtained even if one K-wire is used, inserting one thick K-wire into the intramedullary canal can be an alternative according to the surgeon’s preference."

Aural rehabilitation includes diagnosis and identification of hearing loss, provision of appropriate assistive listening devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, auditory training, speechreading, and communication strategies training. Communication strategies refer to a course of action taken to facilitate conversation interaction or to correct communication problems. Compared to other components of aural rehabilitation, communication strategies have not been focused on as a significant evaluation tool in spite of their importance in daily life. This study aimed to develop a Korean version of the Communication Scale for Older Adults (K-CSOA) originally designed by Kaplan et al. (1997) to evaluate the changes in communication strategies and attitudes. Methods: The K-CSOA was composed of communication strategies and communication attitudes. The Communication strategies have three subcategories of Facilitative (10 items), Repair (15 items), and Preparatory strategies (16 items). The communication attitudes have also three subcategories of Own Attitude (19 items), Family’s Attitude (7 items), and Others Attitude (5 items). The validity and reliability of KCSOA were obtained with total sixty subjects consisting of thirty subjects with normal hearing and thirty subjects with different degrees of hearing loss with mean age of 72 years old ranging from 60 years old to 85 years old. Results: The validity and reliability of the K-CSOA were measured using Pearson`s correlation coefficient, Cronbach Alpha coefficient, and independent t-tests. The correlation coefficients were high (.502-.984) between total means of K-CSOA and subcategories of K-CSOA. The internal consistency ranged from .802 to .930 for Communication Strategies and from .620 to .962 for Communication Attitudes. The test-retest correlation of the K-CSOA was .986 and .988 for Communication Strategies and Attitudes, respectively. The correlation coefficient was .784 between the K-CSOA and Korean Hearing Handicap for the Elderly (KHHIE). In addition, there were significant differences in Communication Strategies and Communication Attitudes between the normal hearing and hearing loss groups. Conclusion: These results indicate that K-CSOA can be used as a useful clinical tool providing in-depth information regarding communication strategies and attitudes in Korean elderly people."

The Korean version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (K-HADS) has been widely used to assess depression and anxiety symptoms in Korean patient with PD. The present study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of the K-HADS using Rasch measurement analysis.Methods: A total of 106 PD patients (54 males, 52 females) who met the diagnostic criteria of the United Kingdom Brain Bank were recruited. Unidimensionality, the Rasch model fit, response category functioning, patient-item distribution, and the separation reliability of the K-HADS depression (K-HADS-D) and anxiety (K-HADS-A) subscales were statistically evaluated.Results: The mean K-HADS-D and K-HADS-A scores were 8.08±4.69 (mean±standard deviation) and 5.44±4.18, respectively. Cronbach’s α coefficients of the K-HADS-D and K-HADS-A were 0.82 and 0.83. The Rasch analysis revealed that the K-HADS-D and K-HADS-A showed unidimensionality and no disordered functioning was observed in the 4-point polytomous scale. However, both K-HADS-D and K-HADS-A exhibited suboptimal separation reliability, while the K-HADS-A showed inadequate scale targeting with floor effect.Conclusions: The present study comprises the first validation of the K-HADS using the Rasch measurement model, suggesting that the K-HADS-D and K-HADS-A are clinimetrically acceptable and reliable scales for use in Korean patients with PD. However, the moderate person separation indices implicate the relatively low discriminatory ability of the K-HADS in our study patients"

In particular, web-based cryptojacking is easy to attack because the victim can mine cryptocurrencies using the victim""s PC resources just by accessing the website and simply adding mining scripts. The cryptojacking attack causes poor performance and malfunction. It can also cause hardware failure due to overheating and aging caused by mining. Cryptojacking is difficult for victims to recognize the damage, so research is needed to efficiently detect and block cryptojacking. In this work, we take representative distinct symptoms of cryptojacking as an indicator and propose a new architecture. We utilized the K-Nearst Neighbors(KNN) model, which trained computer performance indicators as behavior-based dynamic analysis techniques. In addition, a K-means model, which trained the frequency of malicious script words for script similarity-based static analysis techniques, was utilized.

Since ASOS is a point-based observation, it was converted into grid data with a spatial resolution of 0.125° for the application of KLDAS(ASOS-S, ASOS-Spatial). After comparing the hydrometeorological data sets applied to KLDAS against the ground-based observation, the mean of R<sup>2</sup> ASOS-S, MERRA-2, and GDAS were analyzed as temperature(0.994, 0.967, 0.975), pressure(0.995, 0.940, 0.942), humidity (0.993, 0.895, 0.915), and rainfall(0.897, 0.682, 0.695), respectively. For the hydrologic output comparisons, the mean of R<sup>2</sup> was ASOS-S(0.493), MERRA-2(0.56) and GDAS (0.488) in soil moisture, and the mean of R<sup>2</sup> was analyzed as ASOS-S(0.473), MERRA-2(0.43) and GDAS(0.615) in evapotranspiration. MERRA-2 and GDAS are quality-controlled data sets using multiple satellite and ground observation data, whereas ASOS-S is grid data using observation data from 103 points. Therefore, it is concluded that the accuracy is lowered due to the error from the distance difference between the observation data. If the more ASOS observation are secured and applied in the future, the less error due to the gridding will be expected with the increased accuracy."

Such an systematic error in IQ estimation threats the validity of intelligence scale short form. The current study aims to resolve the problem by proposing new way of correction based on RTM amount formula by Davis(1976). To do so, this study compared the accuracies of proration method, linear equating method, regression formula method, regression equation correction by Ehrler et al.(2019) with our correction proposal. Two homogeneous low intelligent groups and a heterogeneous clinical group were tested. As results, the proposed correction method showed better accuracy over regression formula method, better validity over proration method and linear equating method, and more generally applicable over Ehrler et al.(2019)’s correction. The proposed correction method successfully reduced the systematic error of over-estimation for lower intelligence."

"Korean Pop Music a Threat to Contemporary Filipino Identity? Globalization, Nation, and Interrogation in Philippine Culture and Identity",2021,"['K-pop', 'Philippines', 'culture', 'national identity', 'globalization']",,"For almost a decade, Korean Pop (K-pop) music has become a global phenomenon. Transgressing regional boundaries, K-pop music found extraordinary success in Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. Globalization of culture, however, had not only produced skeptics but also challenged the tenets of cultural identity vis-à-vis a crisis on nationalism. This paper seeks to theorize the adverse and favorable effects of K-pop music with regard to its significance to contemporary Filipino national identity through assessment of history, culture, and meaning. This paper tackles and examines its nuance to contradictions of culture and identity and how the transnationalism of pop culture, like K-pop music, contributes to the development of culture and society in the Philippines in recent history."
EMG Based Control of Transhumeral Prosthesis Using Machine Learning Algorithms,2021,"['k-nearest neighbors', 'myo armband', 'prosthetic arm', 'real-time classification', 'surface electromyography', 'transhumeral amputation']",,"This research presents work on control of a prosthetic arm using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals acquired from triceps and biceps of fifteen healthy and four amputated subjects. Myo armband was used to acquire sEMG signals corresponding to four different arm motions: elbow extension, elbow flexion, wrist pronation, and wrist supination. Ten time-domain features were extracted and considered for classification to recognize thefour-arm motions. These features and their various combinations were used to train four different classifiers, in both offline and real-time settings. It was found that the combination of signal mean and waveform length as a feature and k-nearest neighbors as classifier performed significantly better (p < 0.05) than all other combinations in both offline and real-time settings. The offline accuracies of 95.8% and 68.1% and real-time accuracies of 91.9% and 60.1% were obtained for healthy and amputated subjects, respectively. Results obtained using the presented scheme successfully demonstrate that using suitable features and classifier, classification accuracies can be significantly improved for transhumeral prosthesis, thereby, providing better, wearable and non-invasive control of prostheses using sEMG signals."
The Korean Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status-Update : Psychiatric and Neurosurgery Patient Sample Validity,2021,"['K-RBANS', 'Convergent validity', 'Construct validity']",,"Objective : This study aimed to validate the Korean version of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status Update (K-RBANS). Methods : We performed a retrospective analysis of 283 psychiatric and neurosurgery patients. To investigate the convergent validity of the K-RBANS, correlation analyses were performed for other intelligence and neuropsychological test results. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test a series of alternative plausible models of the K-RBANS. To analyze the various capabilities of the K-RBANS, we compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC). Results : Significant correlations were observed, confirming the convergent validity of the K-RBANS among the Total Scale Index (TSI) and indices of the K-RBANS and indices of intelligence (r=0.47-0.81; p<0.001) and other neuropsychological tests at moderate and above significance (r=0.41-0.63; p<0.001). Additionally, the results testing the construct validity of the K-RBANS showed that the second-order factor structure model (model 2, similar to an original factor structure of RBANS), which includes a first-order factor comprising five index scores (immediate memory, visuospatial capacity, language, attention, delayed memory) and one higher-order factor (TSI), was statistically acceptable. The comparative fit index (CFI) (CFI, 0.949) values and the goodness of fit index (GFI) (GFI, 0.942) values higher than 0.90 indicated an excellent fit. The root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) (RMSEA, 0.082) was considered an acceptable fit. Additionally, the factor structure of model 2 was found to be better and more valid than the other model in χ2 values (Δχ2=7.69, p<0.05). In the ROC analysis, the AUCs of the TSI and five indices were 0.716-0.837, and the AUC of TSI (AUC, 0.837; 95% confidence interval, 0.760-0.896) was higher than the AUCs of the other indices. The sensitivity and specificity of TSI were 77.66% and 78.12%, respectively. Conclusion : The overall results of this study suggest that the K-RBANS may be used as a valid tool for the brief screening of neuropsychological patients in Korea."

Spin-up was repeated 8 times in 2018. In addition, low-resolution and high-resolution meteorological data were generated using meteorological data observed by Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), Rural Development Administration (RDA), Korea Rural Community Corporation (KRC), Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co.,Ltd. (KHNP), Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-water), and Ministry of Environment (ME), and applied to KLDAS. And, to confirm the degree of accuracy improvement of Korea Low spatial resolution (hereafter, K-Low; 0.125°) and Korea High spatial resolution (hereafter, K-High; 0.01°), soil moisture and evapotranspiration to which Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and ASOS-Spatial (ASOS-S) used in the previous study were applied were evaluated together. As a result, optimization of the initial boundary condition requires 2 time (58 point), 3 time (6 point), and 6 time (3 point) spin-up for soil moisture. In the case of evapotranspiration, 1 time (58 point) and 2 time (58 point) spin-ups are required. In the case of soil moisture to which MERRA-2, ASOS-S, K-Low, and K-High were applied, the mean of R<sup>2</sup> were 0.615, 0.601, 0.594, and 0.664, respectively, and in the case of evapotranspiration, the mean of R<sup>2</sup> were 0.531, 0.495, 0.656, and 0.677, respectively, indicating the accuracy of K-High was rated as the highest. The accuracy of KLDAS can be improved by securing a large number of ground observation data through the results of this study and generating high-resolution grid-type meteorological data. However, if the meteorological condition at each point is not sufficiently taken into account when converting the point data into a grid, the accuracy is rather lowered. For a further study, it is expected that higher quality data can be produced by generating and applying grid-type meteorological data using the parameter setting of IDW or other interpolation techniques."

This article deals with the transformation of religious symbols during socio-economic crises in early modern East Asia. (1) Maitreya, the future Buddha, had been a deity to prayer for reincarnation into paradise and good fortune in Buddhism and folk religions. However, rebels in premodern China and Korea, who resisted state power, imagined that Maitreya would immediately appear and bring an end to the world. (2) In classical literature, Kaebyŏk was a concept to describe the creation of the world. Kaebyŏk as a radical cosmological transformation in the future, which have been generally accepted by new religions in Korea until the present, gradually emerged during political crises after the 18th century. (3) The concept of Yonaoshi, which had initially meant to pray for the abundance of agriculture, extended its meaning to demanding a radical renewal of the existing world in the period of natural disasters and political upheaval in the 19th century."

When discussing issues about welfare for the aged based on the concept of AIP, the places they send most of their time are exemplified as only home or facility. In other words, this binary approach in terms of places only considers the physical environment. This may also be related to the absence of a scale to measure the sense of place.The purpose of this study is to develop a Korean version of the sense of IBASHO scale(K-SIS). To achieve this purpose, this study conducted a survey on 500 elderly people aged 65 and over living at home in Seoul and Gyeonggi province. Of the 473 final respondents, Using data from 451 suitable for analysis were used for confirmatory factor analysis.The results of evaluating the K-SIS were satisfactory. The K-SIS is Three sub-factors consisted of 19 items. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the scale is composed of 3 factors (Physical, Personal, Social). The scale showed high internal consistency reliability and satisfactory construct validity. This can be interpreted as meaning that the items in the three sub-factors constituting the scale are sufficient to measure the same factor and to measure the concept in which each factor is distinct. The development of the K-SIS will contribute to measuring the sense of IBASHO in the place where social welfare service clients live."

The controversial relations of this middle Mādhyamikas are clearly shown in relation to the interpretation of the first kārikā of the first chapter of the Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā [Mmk], where Bhāviveka insisted that the interpretation of the Buddhapālita was sāvakāśa-vākya and Candrakīrti said that this sāvakāśa-vākya was a same of prasaṅga-vākya.The sāvakāśa-vākya is translated as 'the sentence with room for absurd' or 'the sentence with room for censure'. Looking at the first kārikā of the first chapter of Mmk from the point of sāvakāśa-vākya, when it is said that the existences does not arise from itself, this means that the existence is born from another etc.. In this regard, the prasaṅga interpretation of Candrakīrti can be understood that if the existence arises from itself, it falls into the error that the same thing arises out of the same thing and the same thing arises infinitely.Therefore, I think that the meaning of the sāvakāśa-vākya of Bhāviveka is different from the prasaṅga- vākya of Candrakīrti. It is thought that the understanding of sāvakāśa-vākya and prasanga-vākya in Tibet as well as up to the present day is not consistent and has been misunderstood in some cases.

Kümmell’s disease following OVCF occurrence is not a rare complication and is frequently associated with severe pain or neurologic deficit with progressive kyphotic deformity. Kümmell’s disease initially meant post-traumatic delayed vertebral collapse, but now it is also termed nonunion, osteonecrosis, or intravertebral vacuum cleft, all of which suggest the disruption of the healing process.Current Concepts: The major pathogenesis of Kümmell’s disease is a vascular compromise caused by mechanical stress or intravascular pathology. The key radiologic sign to diagnose Kümmell’s disease is the presence of intravertebral vacuum cleft, observed using simple X-ray, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most useful diagnostic tool showing gas or fluid signals. The risk factors for the progression of Kümmell’s disease after OVCF include middle-column injury, confined low signal intensity on T2-weighted image, posterior wall combined fracture, kyphotic angle >10°, and a height loss >15%.Its treatment can be broadly classified as conservative treatment, bone cement injection, and surgical treatment.The appropriate treatment method is selected based on the pain intensity, neurological symptoms, and the severity of the kyphotic deformity.Discussion and Conclusion: Kümmell’s disease usually develops along with osteoporosis. Therefore, the treatment should be focused on relief from symptoms associated with Kümmell’s disease and osteoporosis.It is recommended that an anabolic agent should be administered after the diagnosis of Kümmell’s disease, regardless of the treatment modality."

Rahner) 신학을 대변한다. 그런데 교회 밖의 구원 가능성에 관한 긍정적 논의는 블롱델(M. Blondel)로부터 신신학(Nouvelle Théologie)으로 이어지는 신학 조류 안에서 공의회 이전부터 발전하고 있었다. 도미니코 수도회 르솔슈아르(Le Saulchoir) 학파에 속했던 스힐레벡스(E. Schillebeeckx)도 라너와 비슷한 시기에 독자적으로 ‘익명의 그리스도인’ 이론을 전개했다. 본고는 1971년 이전 작품을 중심으로 교회 밖의 비그리스도인이 하느님의 보편적인 구원 활동과 연결되는 지점을 정리한다. 스힐레벡스는 하느님과 인간의 특별한 관계를 ‘theologal’로 집약하며 자유의지를 갖고 하느님과 친밀한 상호 주체적 친교를 맺는 인간을 그려낸다.  그는 그리스도를 통해 하느님을 향한 정향성을 회복한 인간은 세상의 구체적 경험을 통해 하느님 앞에 선다고 말한다. 스힐레벡스는 의미를 추구하고 보다 나은 세계를 건설하려는 인간의 모든 노력도 하느님의 구원은총이 작용한 ‘익명의 종교성’으로 간주한다. 그런데 스힐레벡스는 역사라는 상대적 실재에서 그리스도라는 절대적 실재가 드러나고 인간의 삶은 익명성에서 벗어나 하느님의 보편적 구원 의지에 개방된 향주적인 삶의 지평으로 진입한다고 한다. 이처럼 스힐레벡스는 그리스도의 자기 전달 안에서 인간 경험의 초자연적 심연의 차원이 드러나면서 인간이 진정한 자기 이해에 도달한다고 역설한다. 이러한 ‘익명의 그리스도인’ 이해에서 ‘세계 밖의 구원은 없다’는 주장의 그림자가 확인된다. 스힐레벡스의 ‘익명의 그리스도인’ 이론은 교회의 선교 임무를 약화시키지 않는 가운데 비그리스도인 뿐 아니라 신앙인의 일상에서 하느님의 은총을 발견할 수 있는 좋은 틀을 제시할 뿐 아니라, 살아계시는 하느님의 활동을 세계 안에서 사랑과 정의 실천으로 증거하며 세계와 함께 보다 나은 역사를 건설할 그리스도인의 사명을 말해준다.","Although K. Rahner is famous for the theologoumenon of ‘anonymous Christian’, the movement of seeking the possibility of salvation outside the Church was endemic among Catholic theologians in decades preceding Vatican II. Maurice Blondel laid the groundwork for this stream followed by Nouvelle Théologie. The notion of ‘anonymous Christian’ has analogues in the writings of Edward Schillebeeckx, a Dominican affiliated with the School of Le Saulchoir, around the time that it appeared in Karl Rahner’s works. In this paper, Schillebeeckx’s understanding of ‘anonymous Christian’ was analyzed based mainly on his works written before 1971 while asking how an anonymous Christianity stands within the dynamism towards the end of God’s universal salvific activity. Schillebeeckx draws the unique relationship between the human being and God by using neologism of ‘theologal’. By ‘theologal’, Schillebeeckx intends to give salient to the reciprocity and inter-subjectivity of human beings reflected on an intimate relation with God.  According to Schillebeeckx, man who had recovered his tendency toward God by the Grace of Jesus Christ stands before God only through and in a concrete experience in the world. In Schillebeeckx’s the theology an ‘anonymous religiosity’ is not confined on the religious activity, but extended to understanding man’s endeavor of seeking the meaning of his existence and of looking for a better world. He argues that man’s eagerness for these endeavors has its root in the saving activity of God. Besides, according to Schillebeeckx, man’s life enters into a theologal life only when his existence is removed from his anonymous status by opening himself toward Christ, who is the absolute reality revealed in the horizon of history. In this theologal life, the implicit transcendental horizon of life manifests the mystery of God. In the face of which the self-understanding of man reaches to his very core within the absolute self-communication of Christ. From this perspective, in his theology the proposition of “Extra mundium nulla salus” is not contradictory to the  roposition of “extra ecclesia nulla salus.” Schillebeeckx’ theory of ‘anonymous Christian’ presents a perspective from which we Christians can recognize the grace of God working in our concrete daily life in this world without sacrificing the task of mission granted to the Church. Also it reflects the vocation of every Christian to devote themselves on ‘building a better world’ with and in the world while testifying the existence and saving activity of God by our practice of love and justice in our daily life."

The Effects of SCORING First on the Match Results in Football Matches,2021,"['Football', 'Performance Analysis', 'First Goal', 'Situational Variables', 'K-League']",,"Purpose: As a single goal in football has a great value compared to other sport, the importance of the first goal is also greater than other sport. This study aimed to identify the effects of scoring first on the match results considering a variety of match situational variables e.g. match venue, team quality, opposition team quality, the latest performance form, opposition’s latest performance form and time, that were not considered in the previous football studies. Method: All matches(N=162) from all teams(N=12) in K-league during 2020 season were selected as a sample. The data, officially provided from K-league website, were compiled using Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and IBM SPSS 25 was used to conduct statistical analysis. The mean and standard deviation were obtained through descriptive statistical analysis, and cross-tabulation analysis and chi-square analysis were conducted to analyze the mean differences between independent variables. Results: Of all matches, a goal scored during 149 matches and 13 matched finished without a goal, that resulted 0:0. Of 149 matches, the teams that scored the first goal had a 68.5% chance of winning the matches. The winning rate(67.9%) when the home teams scored the first goal was lower than that of the away teams(69%), but there was no statistically significant difference. The winning rate(87.7%) when the top teams scored the first goal was statistically significantly higher than the winning rate(55%) when the middle teams and the bottom teams(52.3%) scored the first goal. The winning rate(47.5%) when scoring the first goal against the top teams was statistically lower than the winning rate(72.9%) when scoring the first goal against the middle teams and the bottom teams(80%). The winning rate of teamsscored first goal at the end of matches(60-75 minutes: 88.2%, 75-90 minutes: 100%) was higher than the winning rate of teams scored first early(0-15 minutes: 64.3%, 15-30 minutes: 63.3%), but there was no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: The first goal had a huge impact on the outcome of the game. In detail, the first goal had a significant impact on the outcome of the matches depending on the level of the teams that scored the first goal and the opposing teams, while the venue, recent performance form and time of the matches did not have a significant impact. Looking at these results, the need for research on the first goal, which greatly affects the outcome of the game, is emerging, and it is believed that systematic analysis is needed to suit the situational variables."

The mission is given based on thorough historical research, which means the narration is focused on the event. Since China has a long and interesting history, they can make better use of the format than any other countries. Based on this their characters could be also expanded in variety, so Let’s Go made a great success in China.Better Late Than Never on NBC in the states is the program that imported the format of Grandpas Over Flowers on TV in Koera. Korean program brought the characters to the forefront, back-grounding the tourist attractions. On the other hand, Better Late Than Never took the opposite strategy. The program centers the extraordinary events and episodes the characters could experience only in the country they visited. Such staged events and backgrounds made the program close to a sitcom or a soap opera. This is the high degree strategy of localization for the American viewers unfamiliar to Korean reality program format.The Voice of Korea and Produce 48 failed in localization by overlooking the differences. The most significant format of The Voice of Korea is ‘the blind audition.’ The winners were selected solely by their singing ability completely excluding the contestants’ appearance, performance or private stories. Thus most viewers lost interest in the competent contestants who don’t need any improvement. Moreover, the winners were neglected in K-POP music market where beautiful appearances and spectacular performances are necessary.Produce Series imported the annual general election format from AKB48, Japanese girl band.The most important point of this format is that every winners were determined by 100% viewer voting. Produce Series attracted the viewers who are called the ‘National producers’ in the show.For this reason, the fairness and the objectivity is necessary for the success. But it has come to the worst program due to unfair editing and vote tampering.For the localism of successful formats and cultural translation, the ingredients of the storytelling should be processed and transformed according to the social, cultural and historical background of the importing country."

Both schools share identical terms and concepts to explain empirical emptiness, but show different approaches and descriptions. For example, regarding bliss/emptiness (bde stong), Jo nang pa explains it in terms of the transcendent experience of the ultimate; Rnying ma pa, in terms of the non-duality between emptiness and phenomena. Explanations of time, which are inextricably tied to their explanations of emptiness, are also similar but different. Both Schools explain primordial timelessness by placing irreducible transcendence and omnipresent and ever present immanence on the same plane. However, Jo nang pa emphasizes that, by means of a gradual approach to purify mental obscuration, the primordial state is revealed, which is an experience of the ultimate reality. This is also a description of Ādibuddha’s primordial time which is different from the conventional time of sentient beings. Meanwhile, Rnying ma pa emphasizes the indeterminacy of the ultimate. In Rdzogs chen practice, when mind is reduced to the primordial state, practitioners realize that conventional mind is primordial mind. Timelessness is experienced through time. Thus, ‘the fourth time’, which is beyond past, present and future, is timeless time or an indeterminate time on which Samanthabhadra’s realization is grounded, being nondual with the three times. In this way, experience of emptiness is explained in conjunction with temporality in both Schools. I suggest that they both explain that ultimate reality lies not in a conventionally flowing chronos time but in a Deleuzian primordial time of aion simultaneous with chronos time, and that the time of aion can be understood as the plane of empirical emptiness."

Therefore, the present study attempts to examine the status of K-pop in the Indonesian market by analyzing the current state and factors pertaining to the popularity of K-pop in Indonesia. The study selected 16 locals who are either operating or active members of a K-pop dance team and collected data using an interview investigation method in order to accurately identify the current state of K-pop in Indonesia. The study then drew a significant conclusion by analyzing the linguistic meanings extracted from the answers to the 15 specific questions. First, there must emerge K-pop productions in a variety of styles and K-pop idols who also possess skills. Second, K-pop must be produced in a way that respects the culture and religion of each country. Third, various government-led classes related to K-pop must be opened and many events must be hosted in order to expand K-pop fandom within Indonesia. The limitations of the present study include the fact that it is difficult to generalize the answers of research participants in a few regions including Yogyakarta as the overall opinion of Indonesians. The present study is significant in that it can reconsider local strategy in the future based on interviews with K-pop fans in the Indonesian market.

In this study, an attempt is made to study the geographic distribution of the various categories of healthcare facilities in the city of Thiruvananthapuram, South India using the centrographic analysis that includes the Mean Center, Standard Deviational Ellipse and Average Nearest Neighbour and it was found that there is an uneven distribution. Network-based point pattern analysis is also performed and cross k-function is used to determine the distribution of medical shops relative to the healthcare services. A weighted node approach is used to calculate the indices of centrality by weighing all nodes based on their degree using Geographical Information System (GIS).Multi centrality assessment model consisting of betweenness, closeness and straightness centrality is used to compute the weighted road centrality on a local and global scale. Kernel Density Estimation technique is applied to modify the centrality values and the vector points to a basic raster framework. Correlation analysis was performed to find the role of the network centrality on the location of healthcare facilities in the study area. Correlation values are greatest among category 2 hospitals; straightness centrality and betweenness centrality favours the location of category 1 hospitals and homeopathy hospitals respectively. The results confirm that network topology influences the location of medical facilities in the study area."
Supervised learning and frequency domain averaging‐based adaptive channel estimation scheme for filterbank multicarrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation,2021,"['channel estimation', 'FBMC‐OQAM', 'frequency domain averaging', 'k‐nearest neighbors', 'supervised machine learning']",,"Filterbank multicarrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC‐OQAM) is an attractive alternative to the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique. In comparison with OFDM, the FBMC‐OQAM signal has better spectral confinement and higher spectral efficiency and tolerance to synchronization errors, primarily due to per‐subcarrier filtering using a frequency‐time localized prototype filter. However, the filtering process introduces intrinsic interference among the symbols and complicates channel estimation (CE). An efficient way to improve the CE in FBMC‐OQAM is using a technique known as windowed frequency domain averaging (FDA); however, it requires a priori knowledge of the window length parameter which is set based on the channel's frequency selectivity (FS). As the channel's FS is not fixed and not a priori known, we propose a k‐nearest neighbor‐based machine learning algorithm to classify the FS and decide on the FDA's window length. A comparative theoretical analysis of the mean‐squared error (MSE) is performed to prove the proposed CE scheme's effectiveness, validated through extensive simulations. The adaptive CE scheme is shown to yield a reduction in CE‐MSE and improved bit error rates compared with the popular preamble‐based CE schemes for FBMC‐OQAM, without a priori knowledge of channel's frequency selectivity."

(1) 梵語 ‘gate’를 ‘揭帝’를 써서 對譯한 것은 문제가 없다. 즉 梵語의 ‘g-’는 全濁聲母인 ‘羣母字’를 써서 對譯하였고, 梵語 ‘te-’는 舌尖塞音인 ‘端母字’를 써서 대역하였기 때문이다. (2) 梵語 ‘gate’에서 ‘ga’ 를 羣母字인 ‘揭’나 疑母字인 ‘誐’로 대역할 수 있는 것은 ‘揭’의 中古音 추정음이 유성음 ‘g- 이고, 아음 ‘誐’의 中古音 추정음은 ‘ŋ-’로 ‘g- 와 조음 위치가 같으면서 次濁으로 기식이 적어 상대적으로 유성 무기음을 나타내기에 적절했기 때문이었을 것이다. (3) 梵語 ‘gate’를 ‘誐諦’를 써서 對譯한 것에 대하여는 숙고한 결과, 梵語 ‘g-’는 단지 순수한 有聲無氣音이 아니고 鼻音 성분이 내포된 音으로 인식한 것이기 때문이라고 유추할 수 있다. 그리고 梵語 ‘t-’는 ‘諦’를 對譯한 것은 ‘帝’와 같이 舌尖塞音인 ‘端母字’를 써서 대역하였기 때문에 문제가 없다. (4) 『般若心經』 呪文에서 ‘gate’는 漢語로 ‘揭帝’로 對譯한 글자를 쓰고 있지만, 韓國語로 ‘아제’로 읽는 것은, 梵語의 ‘ga’가 鼻音聲母인 것을 인식하고 漢語에서 ‘誐’로 對譯한 것을 따라 읽은 것이다. (5) 梵語 ‘pāragate’ 중의 ‘pā’를 漢語에서는 幫母字인 ‘波(播)’로 對譯하였다. ‘波(播)’는, 幫母字로서 漢語에서는 無聲無氣音인 /p-/로 읽히고 있으며, 현대의 韓國 漢字音으로는 우리말의 激音化현상에 의해 音이 변화하여 ‘파’로 읽히지만, 『東國正韻』시기에는 脣音 全淸 ‘바’로 주음했고, 『般若心經』의 呪文을 읽을 때도, 『訓民正音』시기의 音을 따라 ‘바’로 읽는다. (6) 梵語 ‘pāragate’에서 ‘-r-’는 에 해당하는 讀音은 漢語에 없으므로, 그것과 유사한 것으로 來母字인 ‘羅’를 써서 對譯하였다. 그러나 音譯本에서는 口邊字인 囉를 만들어 梵語 ‘r-’을 나타내었다. (7) 梵語의 ‘pārasaṃgate’에서 ‘saṃ’은 曾攝字를 써서 對譯하였다. 梵語의 ‘-aṃ’은 漢語의 宕摄(/-ɑŋ/)과 曾摄(/-əŋ/) 그리고 梗摄(/-ɐŋ/) 등으로 나누어 배열하고 있으나, 굳이 曾攝字인 ‘僧’을 써서 對譯한 것은, ‘僧’의 문자학적인 의미에서 찾을 수도 있을 것으로 보았다.","Within the Banyasimgyeong(Prajñā-Paramitā/般若心經)’s zhòuwén(呪文/incantations), the term ‘gate’ uses letters that have been transliterated as ‘jiē dì(揭帝) in Chinese but reading this as ’ahjae’ in Korean meant that it recognized that ‘ga’ in Sanskrit(梵語) was bíyīnshēngmǔ(鼻音聲母/nasal initial sounds) and that it followed the reading sounds that have been transliterated to ‘誐(ah)’ in Chinese. The ‘pā’ amongst the Sanskrit ‘pāragate’ was translated into ‘波(播)(bō)’ which is a Bāngmǔzì(幫母字) in Chinese. The ‘波(播)(bō)’ is read off as /p-/, which is a wúshēngwúqìyīn(無聲無氣音/silent sound) which acts as a bāngmǔzì in Chinese. This is read off as ‘pa’ in Korean for Chinese character sounds due to the changes in the phoneme due to the aspirated phenomenon but during the time of ‘Donggukjeongun(東國正韻)’, it was pronounced as ‘ba’ under the chúnyīnquánqīng(脣音全淸/labial tones) and when reading off the incantations in the Banyasimgyeong, it was pronounced as ‘ba’ following the sounds dictated by the time of the Hunminjeongeum(訓民正音/a.k.a. Hangeul). The pronunciation of ‘-r-’ within the Sanskrit ‘pāragate’ did not exist in Chinese so it was transliterated into a similar sound ‘luó(羅)’ which is a Láimǔzì(來母字/lai initial consonant letter). However, in the book of chinese character transcription, the ‘luó(羅)’ which is a kǒubiānzì(口邊字/verbal letter) was created to indicate the Sanskrit ‘r-’ sound. The ‘saṃ’ in the Sanskrit ‘pārasaṃgate’ was transliterated by using the Céngshèzì(曾攝字). The ‘-aṃ’ in Sanskrit has been arranged in sequence according to the Chinese Dàngshè(宕摄)(/-ɑŋ/), Céngshè(曾摄)(/-əŋ/) and gěngshè(梗摄)(/-ɐŋ/) but the reason why the Sēng(僧) of the Céngshèzì(曾攝字) was chosen for the transliteration amongst other sounds has been deemed to be because of the graphemic meaning that can be found in the character ‘Sēng(僧)’."
『능가경』의 여래장설,2021,"['『능가경』', '알라야식', '여래장', '무루습기', '윤회의 주체', 'Laṅkāvatārasūtra', 'ālayavijñāna', 'tathāgatagarbha', 'anāsravavāsanā', 'agent of saṃsāra.']","『능가경』에서는 ‘알라야식이라고 불리는 여래장’, ‘여래장이라고 불리는 알라야 식’, ‘여래장알라야식’이라는 표현으로 여래장과 알라야식을 결합시키고 있다. 본고 에서는 이들 표현들이 등장하는 『능가경』의 「찰나품」을 중심으로 하여 『능가경』의 여래장설을 고찰한다. 먼저 ‘알라야식이라고 불리는 여래장’이라는 표현의 의미를 분석하는 방식으로, 『능가경』에서 여래장은 알라야식과 동일시되고 있다고 하는 종래의 견해를 검토한 다. 『능가경』에서는 여래장이 희론습기에 훈습될 때 알라야식이라고 불린다고 ‘알 라야식이라고 불리는 여래장’의 의미를 설명한다. 즉 훈습된 여래장이 알라야식인 것이지 여래장 자체가 알라야식인 것은 아니다. 이로부터 『능가경』의 여래장설의 특징으로 여래장과 알라야식의 동일시를 제시하는 기존의 견해들은 수정될 필요 가 있음을 도출한다. 이어서 『능가경』에서 여래장은 알라야식이 아니라 알라야식에 내장되어 있는 무루습기임을 논증한다. 그 근거는, 첫째, 희론습기에 훈습된 여래장은 무루습기 와 전식습기로 구성되어 있으며 이 때 희론습기는 전식습기에 대응하고 여래장은 무루습기에 대응하기 때문이다. 둘째, 무루습기는 『능가경』에서 무위법으로 인식 되고 있기 때문이다. 셋째, 보리류지는 무루습기를 가리키는 무위법을 진여여래장으로 번역하고 있기 때문이다. 마지막으로 『능가경』에서 여래장은 윤회의 주체로서의 알라야식이 갖는 모순점 을 해결하기 위하여 도입되었음을 밝힌다. 유식의 체계에서 윤회의 주체로서 등 장하는 알라야식은 윤회의 주체이므로 비찰나적이지만 동시에 유위법이기 때문에 찰나적이라는 점에서 모순된다. 『능가경』에서는 윤회의 주체로 ‘알라야식이라고 불 리는 여래장’을 제시하는데, 이때 여래장은 윤회의 주체가 갖는 비찰나성으로 활 용되고 있다. 이로부터 『능가경』의 여래장 도입의도가 윤회의 주체로서의 알라야 식이 갖는 모순점을 해결하기 위한 것에 있었음이 드러난다.","Laṅkāvatārasūtra (LAS) combines tathāgatagarbha with ālayavijñāna in the expression of ‘tathāgatagarbha which is called ālayavijñāna’, ‘ālayavijñāna which is called tathāgatagarbha’, ‘tathāgatagarbhālayavijñāna’. In this paper, I examined the theory of LAS based on the kṣaṇikaparivarta contained within LAS in which these expressions appear. First, by analyzing the meaning of the expression ‘tathāgatagarbha which is called ālayavijñāna’, I examined the existing theory that tathāgatagarbha is identified with ālayavijñāna in LAS. And based on the fact that it is the tathāgatagarbha infused by prapañcavāsanā that is called the ālayavijñāna, rather than the tathāgatagarbha itself, I deduced that LAS doesn’t identify tathāgatagarbha with ālayavijñāna. Next, I argued that tathāgatagarbha is anāsravavāsanā, which exists in the ālayavijñāna. The reason for this is that, first, the tathāgatagarbha that is infused by prapañcavāsanā consists of anāsravavāsanā and pravṛttivijñānavāsanā. Among them, prapañcavāsanā corresponds to pravṛttivijñānavāsanā and tathāgatagarbha corresponds to anāsravavāsanā. Second, the anāsravavāsanā is recognized as asaṃskṛta in LAS. Third, Bodhiruci translates the asaṃskṛta, which refers to anāsravavāsanā, into 真如如來藏. Finally, I argued that tathāgatagarbha is accepted to resolve the contradiction of ālayavijñāna as the agent of saṃsāra in LAS. To be the agent of saṃsāra, one must not be momentary. But ālayavijñāna is momentary in the system of Vijñānavādin. In LAS, ‘tathāgatagarbha which is called ālayavijñāna’ is the agent of saṃsāra. And at the time tathāgatagarbha is used as a continuity which is essential to the agent of saṃsāra. From this, it is revealed that LAS accepted the tathāgatagarbha to resolve the contradiction of ālayavijñāna as the agent of saṃsāra."
핵심기본간호술을 통한 첫 간호의미 경험,2021,,,"The purpose of this study to understand the meaning of nursing through core basic nursing for nursing students before clinical practice. Participants of this study were analyzed through interviews after taking the core basic nursing skills class for 3rd graders who are currently enrolled in the Department of Nursing at M University. Seventeen students were enrolled in a K-city university as a third-year student who first performed core basic nursing skills. As a result of the study, it was derived into 3 categories and 19 thematic collections. The three categories included 1. meaning of help, 2. overcoming fear, and 3. opportunity to acquire nursing skills. The conclusion was that the first core basic nursing skills before clinical practice was a time to learn the true meaning of nursing through mutual help The difficulties were overcome with repeated practice, and the acquisition of newly learned nursing skills appeared as an effective process to experience with confidence. Therefore, it can be used as a useful basic data for counseling and guidance on the adaptation of nursing students to clinical practice, and it is expected that it will be used as a useful data for successful practice application counseling."
프랜차이즈 뷰티 아카데미의 교육서비스 품질이 관계 몰입을 통한 교육 서비스 성과에 미치는 영향 연구: 신뢰 수준의 조절효과,2021,"['Beauty Academy', 'Franchise', 'Quality of Education Service', 'Relationship Commitment', 'Trust Level', '뷰티 아카데미', '프랜차이즈', '교육서비스 품질', '관계몰입', '신뢰수준']","최근 K팝을 필두로 한 한류열풍과 K뷰티에 관한 관심이 높아지고 있다. 또한, 국내 뷰티 서비스 산업에 대한 인기와 영향력이 커지며 경제적, 문화적 파급효과가 지속해서 확대되고 있다. 해당 파급효과와 더불어 국내 뷰티 서비스 발전에 따른 인력 수요에 대응한 전문인력양성 필요성이 강조되고 있기도 하며 뷰티 아카데미의 실 수요자인 교육생도 점차 증가하고 있다. 따라서 본 연구의 목적은 뷰티 아카데미에서 제공하는 교육서비스에 있어 교육목적을 달성하기 위한 교육서비스 품질요인의 중요성과 관계몰입 간 영향 관계 및 교육서비스 성과를 살펴보는 것이다. 나아가 교육서비스 제공 활동을 비롯하여 행정지원서비스, 교육프로그램 등의 중요성을 도출하는 것이다. 하지만 뷰티 서비스 제공에 따르는 전문인력 양성을 위한 연구는 뷰티 산업의 발전속도에 비하여 부족한 편이다. 따라서 뷰티 서비스 교육이 강조되고 있는 현재 시점에서 본 연구는 국내 프랜차이즈 뷰티 아카데미의 교육생들이 교육서비스 품질을 바탕으로 하는 관계몰입과 교육서비스 성과에 간의 영향 관계를 살펴볼 것이다.본 연구 수행을 위해 설정한 측정변수는 프로그램, 강사자질, 수강료, 외적 서비스, 서비스 공정성, 관계몰입, 신뢰수준, 교육서비스 성과이다. 해당 변수들은 설문조사를 통한 자료를 분석하여 측정하였으며 실증분석 결과 아래와 같은 내용을 도출하였다.첫째, 뷰티 아카데미에서 제공하는 교육서비스 품질인 프로그램, 외적 서비스, 서비스 공정성, 관계몰입 그리고 신뢰수준은 관계몰입에 유의한 영향을 미쳤다. 교육프로그램의 체계성과 다양성 등 학원 측에서 제공하는 교육서비스가 수강생에게 일률적인 관계몰입을 가능케 하는 것으로 나타났다. 교육서비스 품질 자체가 수강생 입장에서 뷰티 서비스 제공에 필요한 전문지식을 학습 받고 학원과의 관계에 유기적인 역할을 하는 것이다.둘째, 교육서비스 품질과 관계몰입에 있어 학원과 수강생 간 신뢰수준의 조절 효과가 유의하게 나타났다. 이는 학원이 제공하는 교육서비스에 대하여 수강생들의 실질적인 신뢰 관계를 통해 더욱 높은 수준의 서비스품질을 느끼게 된다는 것이다.위와 같은 실증분석 결과를 바탕으로 본 연구가 가지는 시사점은 교육서비스 성과로 대표되는 수강생 실력과 만족도를 향상할 방안을 강구하는 것이다. 뷰티 아카데미라는 학원 입장에서 제공하는 교육서비스 품질이 교육시설이나 수강생들의 진로 선택에도 큰 영향을 미칠 것이기 때문이다. 교육 자체에 관한 일관성과 편의성, 지식 지향성 등의 특성이 종합적으로 고려되어야 할 것이며 학원의 외부환경인 외적 서비스 요인을 통한 이미지 형성으로 강력한 시장 입지를 구축해야 한다. 나아가 경쟁업체와의 차별화된 전략 제시 측면에서도 교육서비스품질요인은 수강생과의 관계몰입에 상당히 중요한 역할을 하는 것으로 알 수 있기에 수강생의 행동에 수반되는 수요를 사전적으로 파악하여 수강생 개인이 경험하는 심리적 안정감에도 관계 마케팅 역할이 중요할 것이다.","Recently, interest in Korean Wave craze and K-beauty, led by K-pop, is increasing. In addition, the popularity and influence of the domestic beauty service industry has increased, and the economic and cultural ripple effects have been continuously expanding. The need to professional manpower training in response to the demand for manpower due to the growing development of domestic beauty services is emphasized, and the number of trainees who are actual consumers of beauty academy is increasing. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to examine the importance of quality factors of educational services to achieve educational purposes in the educational services provided by the Beauty Academy and the relationship between relationship commitment and educational service performance. Furthermore, it is to draw the importance of administrative support services, educational programs as well as educational service provision activities.However, the research for professional manpower training according to the provision of beauty services is insufficient compared to the development speed of the beauty industry. Therefore, at the present time when beauty service education is emphasized, our study will examine the relationship between relationship commitment and educational service performance based on the quality of education service by the students of domestic beauty academy.The measurement variables set for our study are program, instructor quality, tuition, external service, service fairness, relationship commitment, trust level, and educational service performance. The variables were analyzed and derived through the survey, and the following contents were derived from the empirical analysis.First, the quality of education service provided by the beauty academy, such as program, external service, service fairness, relationship commitment and trust level, had a significant effect on relationship commitment. Educational services provided by the institute, such as the systematicity and diversity of educational programs, enabled students to have a uniform relationship commitment. The quality of education service itself is to learn the expertise necessary for providing beauty service from the standpoint of the students and play an organic role in the relationship with the institute.Second, the moderating effect of trust level between academies and students was significant in the quality of education service and the relationship commitment. This means that students will feel higher level of service quality through the practical trust relationship of the students about the educational services provided by the institute.Based on the results of the empirical analysis, the implications of our study are to find ways to improve the students' ability and satisfaction represented by the results of educational services. This is because the quality of education services provided by the institute called Beauty Academy will have a great impact on the career choice of educational facilities and students. The characteristics of consistency, convenience, and knowledge orientation of education itself should be considered comprehensively, and a strong market position should be established through image formation through external service factors, which are external environments of academies.Furthermore, in terms of presenting differentiated strategies with competitors, the educational service quality factors play a significant role in the commitment to the relationship with the students, so the role of relationship marketing will be important for the psychological stability experienced by the students by grasping the demand accompanying the behavior of the students in advance."

Historic and cultural resources have the advantage of being a material that ordinary people can easily relate to in life and culture while linking with the values that dominate our daily life for a long time. In addition, for local governments, it is undoubtedly an attractive material in that it can solidify their identity and elicit the sense of beloning of community members. The cultural content developing project using historic and cultural resources currently being carried out by individual local governments is to shape cultural resources in the region into contents as a tool for revitalizing cultural tourism, thereby creating a business model that can revitalize the local economy. However, in the case of historic and cultural resources based on historical facts, it is possible that various local governments can utilize it rather than being exclusively attributed to a specific local government, and it is true that the handling of them varies according to the size and characteristics of individual local governments. In particular, in the process of a specific local government trying to monopolize historic and cultural resources that have the characteristics of a public good, fierce competition for ownership of one material is even seen between regions. In order to solve such a problem, it is necessary to change the perspective and method of dealing with the existing historic and cultural resources, and it is also necessary to redefine the meaning of mutually beneficial development. This study intends to propose an organic community operation model between local governments in which a plurality of local governments share the core themes and contents of historic and cultural resources as media containing the values of the times, and use them for individual city marketing differently. The concept of inter-city theme sharing community model was derived from the German case so that local governments could organically unite while sharing the core themes of historic and cultural resources. It could show operating model of K-style inter-city theme sharing community ."

For this, first of all, we looked at the usage examples of vijñapti, focusing on 9 kārikā of Viṃśatika. Next, the relationship between self-seeds(svabīja) and vijñapti, and the relationship between appearance(pratibhāsa) and vijñapti were examined.Therefore, The cause of vijñapti is self-seeds(svabīja) in ālayavijñāna. The self-seeds(svabīja) change and appear in a shape similar to that of an external object. It is the vijñapti known to us that has appeared so. Therefore, Vijñapti encompasses both self-seeds(svabīja) and appearance(pratibhāsa). Vijñapti has the characteristic that exists as self-seeds(svabīja) with its own seed or as appearance(pratibhāsa) with manifestation. Therefore, the world exists only as vijñapti(vijñaptimātra)."

In the process of erecting monuments at royal relics and publishing many booklets during the King Jeongjo period, the ‘saja-gwan’ played an central role as they copied such works neatly, which were then presented to Jeongjo for compilation. However, there are very few data showing details about the officials and their activities at that time. Hongjae-jeonseo (K4-5702), one of Jangseogak’s collection records the names, activities and other various aspects of the ‘saja-gwan’ during King Jeongjo.  In general, ten ‘saja-gwan’ officials appear in 18 books edited in fine print, compared to 35 in 14 books in bold writing. Six ‘saja-gwan’ appear in both data. Each of the 39 other ‘saja-gwan’ did not participate in the transcription of the material. This means that these two series of Hongjae-jeonseo (K4-5702) transcriptions were not performed at the same time, but the time difference was not huge. Therefore, it can be estimated that six people worked together during a period of their appearance in the two data.  Through this, it can be confirmed that the ‘saja-gwan’ used the same style of handwriting, not their personal one.

게임의 확장성과 웹툰 -트랜스미디어 시대 게임 IP의 웹툰화를 중심으로-,2021,"['웹툰', '게임', '게임화', '트랜스미디어', '확장성', 'Webtoon', 'Game', 'OSMU', 'Trans-media', 'IP', 'Gamification']","문화콘텐츠 중에서 세계 문화 시장을 리드하며 두각을 나타내고 있는 분야가 K-pop과 웹툰 그리고 게임이라고 할 수 있다. K-pop은 이미 세계 대중음악의 새로운 장르로 자리 잡았고 웹툰은 고유한 형식을 만들어 세계인을 상대로 서비스하며 영토를 확장시키고 있는 중이다. 하지만 게임은 중국의 판호 발급이라는 거대한 벽에 막혀 산업 초기의 성장세가 꺾인 모양새다. 그래도 다행스러운 것은 미국, 중국, 일본에 이어 세계 시장 점유율 4위를 기록하고 있다는 점이다.  거대한 중국 게임 시장이 열리기를 기대하는 국내 게임 산업계는 올해를 새로운 도약의 해로 만들기 위한 다양한 움직임을 보이고 있다. 그중에서 주목해야 할 것이 IP게임 개발과 확장성이다. 과거 중국에 비해서 기술적 우위를 점하고 있던 우리나라 게임은 자본과 시장 규모를 앞세우며 성장해 온 중국 게임과 대등해지거나 어느 부분에서는 추월당하고 있다. 이를 극복하고 세계 게임 시장을 리드하기 위해서는 새로운 IP 개발이 절실해졌다. 과거 중국은 해외 저작권을 외면하거나 의도적으로 도용을 묵인했다. 하지만 게임 시장의 글로벌화가 이루어지고, 저작권 문제가 대두 되면서 중국내 저작권 보호도 강화되고 있다. 이때 국내 게임사 위메이드가 중국 샨다게임즈와 벌인 「미르의 전설」 저작권 분쟁에서 승소한 것은 매우 의미 있는 일이다. 이제 게임은 IP전쟁이라 할 만큼 IP가 중요해졌다. 아무리 좋은 게임이라고 해도 부가가치를 높이고 저작권 보호를 받기 위해서는 게임 IP를 소유하고 있어야 한다. 많은 게임 제작사들이 근래에 인수 합병이 원활하게 이루어지고 있는 것도 내면에는 게임 IP를 소유하고 개발하기 위해서다. 이와 더불어 중요한 부분이 게임콘텐츠의 확장성이다. 이미 원소스멀티유즈라는 개념이 일반화 되면서 타 장르간 콘텐츠 공유나 확장이 활성화 되고 있다. 근래에 드라마, 영화는 물론 웹툰들이 게임화가 이루어지는 현상들을 자주 보게 된다. 그중에서 주목되는 것이 웹툰 IP를 활용한 게임 제작이다. 웹툰의 게임화는 웹툰의 인기와 검증된 콘텐츠의 활용이라는 측면에서 중요한 사업적 가치를 창출했다. 이제 거꾸로 게임 IP의 확장성에 대한 적극적인 고민과 접근이 필요한 시기다. 게임은 이미 종합문화콘텐츠 산업으로 자리 잡았고, 이는 게임 산업이 문화산업 전반에 걸쳐서 영향력이 확대 된다는 의미가 된다. 현대 문화콘텐츠 산업은 한 분야에 머무르지 않고 트랜스미디어화 되는 현상이 늘어나고 있다. 이제 게임도 이러한 시대적 트랜드에 맞게 게임 IP를 활용한 웹툰 제작에 적극적으로 접근해야 한다. 게임의 세계관을 공유하며 만들어진 웹툰은 또 다른 문화콘텐츠 소비욕구를 충족시키고 게임 시장성을 확대시키며, 게임 IP를 견고하게 만들어 줄 수 있기 때문이다. 이미 몇몇 게임에서 시도 되고 있는 이러한 현상은 트랜스미디어 환경과 맞물리면서 더욱더 늘어날 것으로 보인다. 이에 본 연구는 지속적으로 중요시되고 있는 게임 IP와 이를 기반으로 만들어진 웹툰화 과정을 분석하고, 트랜스미디어 시대의 게임 산업의 확장성 측면으로 웹툰의 가치와 상관관계를 밝힘으로써 향후 게임과 웹툰 산업 발전에 기여하고자 한다.","Games have already established themselves as a comprehensive cultural contents industry, which means that the game industry will expand its influence throughout the cultural industry. The modern cultural contents industry is not limited to one field and is increasingly becoming transmedia. Now, games should also actively approach to the production of webtoons using game IP in line with this trend of the times. This is because webtoons created by sharing IP(Intellectual Property) of the game can satisfy the desire to consume another cultural contents industry, expand the game marketability, and strengthen the game IP. This phenomenon, which is already being tried in some games, is expected to increase even more as it engages with the transmedia environment. Therefore, this study analyzes the game IP, which is constantly being considered important, and the webtoonization process created based on it, and reveals the value and correlation of webtoon in terms of the scalability of the game industry in the transmedia era."
Comparison between Pin Fixation and Combined Screw Fixation in Proximal Chevron Metatarsal Osteotomy for Hallux Valgus Deformity Correction,2021,"['Hallux valgus', 'Proximal chevron metatarsal osteotomy', 'Pin fixation', 'Combined screw fixation']",,"Background: Problems associated with hallux valgus deformity correction using Kirschner-wire (K-wire) fixation include pin pullout and loss of stability. These complications are pronounced in the osteopenic bone, and few reports have focused on pin versus screw fixation. We examined the use of additional screw fixation to avoid these problems. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of K-wire fixation (KW) and a combined K-wire and screw fixation (KWS).Methods: Two groups with hallux valgus deformity, who were treated with a proximal chevron metatarsal osteotomy (PCMO), were compared based on the fixation method used. The KW group included 117 feet of 98 patients, and the KWS group included 56 feet of 40 patients. Clinically, the preoperative and final follow-up visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux score, and patient satisfaction score were evaluated. Radiographically, hallux valgus angle (HVA) and intermetatarsal angle (IMA) were measured.Results: The mean VAS score decreased from 6.3 preoperatively to 1.6 postoperatively in the KW group and from 5.7 preoperatively to 0.5 postoperatively in the KWS group (p < 0.001). The mean AOFAS scores of the KW and KWS groups improved from 59.4 and 58.2, respectively, to 88.9 and 95.3, respectively (p < 0.001). Eighty-five percent in the KW group and 93% in the KWS group were satisfied with surgery. Clinical differences were not significant. The mean HVAs decreased from 34.7° to 9.1° in the KW group and from 38.5° to 9.2° in the KWS group (p < 0.001). The mean IMA decreased from 14.5° (range, 11.8°–17.2°) to 6.4° (range, 2.7°–10.1°) in the KW group and from 18.0° (range, 14.8°–21.2°) to 5.3° (range, 2.5°–8.1°) in the KWS group (p < 0.001). When IMA values at the 3-month postoperative and the final follow-up were compared, the IMA was significantly increased only in the KW group (p < 0.001) and no difference was found in the KWS group (p = 0.280).Conclusions: We found a statistically significant difference in the decrease in IMA between the 2 groups. We recommend the combined pin and screw fixation in PCMO to enhance fixation stability and prevent potential hallux valgus correction loss."
1990년대 한국 가요 뉴트로(Newtro) 현상에 대한 일고찰 -‘양준일 현상’을 사례로-,2021,"['양준일', '90년대 가요', '레트로', '뉴트로', '국가주의', 'Yang Joon-il', '1990s K-pop', 'retro', 'newtro', 'nationalism']","이 글은 ‘양준일 현상’을 사례로 1990년대 한국 가요 뉴트로 생산과 소비 양상과 그 의미를 파악한 것이다. ‘양준일 현상’은 90년대를 겪지 않은 요즘 10대층이 과거의 영상 속에서 양준일을 ‘지드래곤 닮은 꼴’이란 캐릭터를 부여하여 불러냈고, ‘슈가맨’ 프로그램을 통해 소환된 이후에는 90년대 경험 세대인 40대가 그에게 열광하며 거대한 양준일 팬덤 문화를 일으킨 레트로-뉴트로의 색다른 소비 방식을 보여준다.  신드롬을 일으킨 세대와 신드롬을 팬덤 문화로 정착시킨 세대가 다른 점, 심지어 팬덤 문화를 이끄는 90년대 경험 세대조차도 당대 양준일에 대해 알고 있는 경우가 거의 없다는 점에서 좋았던 과거를 파고드는 기성세대의 레트로에 속하지 않고, 젊은 세대가 새로이 과거의 문화를 재창조하는 뉴트로로 단정하기에도 어려운 이례적인 현상이라 할 수 있다.  ‘양준일 현상’에서 볼 수 있는 독특한 부분은 그가 과거에 톱스타였는지, 가수로서의 충분한 기량을 보유하고 있는지는 별 의미가 없다는 점이다. 동안의 외모와 그의 선구적인 패션을 통해 팬이 꿈꾸는 시간여행을 만끽할 수 있는지가 훨씬 중요한 요소로 작용한다. 이것이 기존 90년대 레트로 · 뉴트로 현상과의 결정적 차이다.  ‘시간여행자’ 양준일이 겪은 신데렐라 스토리는 팬들이 그를 스타의 반열에 오르도록 하는데 결정적인 당위를 부여했다. 또한 그가 보여준 겸손한 남편이자 아빠, 국민으로서의 인성과 철학은 이 시대 스타가 지녀야 할 도덕적 · 윤리적 이상향에 부합하는 것이었다. ‘양준일 현상은 사회적 기억에 없는 그 시절 그때를 소환하여 소비하는 독특한 문화로 자리매김했다.  스타 양준일의 본격적인 행보는 한국 사회의 혹독한 도덕적 검증을 예고하는 것이었다. 양준일의 과거 이력에 대한 전면적 공격은 그가 강조했던 스타관, 인생관, 가족관, 국가관의 범위에서 작동하는 양상을 보인다. 한국 사회에 재진입하고자 하는 옛 가수에 대한 과도한 관심과 검증 욕구는 한국 사회에 만연한 가족확장성에 깊은 뿌리를 두고 있으며, 그 속성의 요건은 도덕 지향성의 문제와 긴밀한 관계를 맺고 있다. 도덕 지향성은 도덕적인 것과는 매우 다른 것으로, 사람들의 모든 언동을 도덕에 비추어 평가하는 ‘도덕 환원주의’라 할 수 있다.  현재 양준일을 통해 바라보는 국민주의의 모습은 그간 국가 바깥 영역으로 두고 도외시했던 교포사회 구성원까지 한국인으로 수용할 것인지, 또한 수용의 검증을 통과한 이들에게 국민으로서의 소속감을 부여할 것인지 고민하는 이른바 ‘다원적 국가주의’ 확장으로의 단면을 보여주고 있다.","This article examines the production and consumption patterns of the K-pop’s Newtro trend from the 1990s and its meaning based on the case of ‘Yang Joon-il phenomenon. The ‘Yang Joon-il phenomenon’ shows the exceptional consumption style of retro-newtro in which 21th teenagers rediscoverd and nicknamed him ‘looks like G-Dragon from the past performance videos, and the middle-aged has created a huge fandom through his appearance in a TV show ‘Sugar Man’.  The unprecedented part of ‘Yang Joon-il phenomenon’ is that it doesn’t matter whether he was a top star in the past or whether he has sufficient skills as a singer. A much more important point is that fans enjoy the time travel through his youthful looking and remarkable sense of fashion. This is the decisive difference from the other retro-newtro phenomenon of the 1990s.  The Cinderella story experienced by Yang Joon-il, the ‘time traveler’, gave fans a decisive justification for him to rise to the ranks of stars. In addition, his humble personality and philosophy as a husband, father and citizen live up to the moral and ethical virtues that a star should possess in this era.  With star Yang Joon-il’s popularity, he was subjected to harsh moral verification of Korean society. Excessive interest and verification is footed in the prevalence of family expansion in Korean society, and the requirements for its attributes are closely related to the issue of moral orientation. Moral orientation is very different from morality, and it can be called ‘moral reductionism’, which evaluates people’s words and actions by reducing them to morality.  The current state of nationalism viewed through Yang Joon-il is the so-called ‘whether to accept the people of the Korean-Korean society, who have been neglected as outside the country, as Koreans, and whether to give the immigrants who have passed the verification of acceptance a sense of belonging as a citizen’. It shows the cross-section of the expansion of ‘pluralistic nationalism’."
갈애의 발생과 소멸에 관한 일고찰 - 빠알리(Pāli) 문헌을 중심으로 -,2021,"['갈애', '감각적 즐거움', '유(有)와 무유(無有)', '견해', '느낌', '수념처(受念處)', '지견(知見)', 'craving', 'sense pleasure', 'being & nothingness', 'view', 'sensation', 'contemplation of sensation', 'knowledge & vision']","본고는 고(苦)의 주요 원인인 갈애(渴愛)의 의미와 기능을 살펴보고, 그것이 생기하는 조건과 사라지게 하는 방법을 탐구함으로써 그 수행적 위상을 규명하기 위한 것이다. 갈애는 모든 괴로움의 뿌리이므로 갈애의 소멸은 괴로움의 종식으로서 열반을 의미한다. 불교 수행의 방법론은 갈애를 소멸하기 위한 방향으로 수렴된다고 보아도 좋을 정도로 반드시 정화해야 할 핵심적인 요소로서 중요시된다. 갈애의 종류는 보통 그것을 일으키는 대상을 기준으로 ‘감각적 즐거움(kāma)에 대한 갈애’, ‘유(有, bhava)에 대한 갈애’, ‘무유(無有, vibhava)에 대한 갈애’ 이렇게 세 가지로 구분한다. 여기에서 ‘유에 대한 갈애’는 자아(我)와 세상(界)이 존속한다는 견해인 상견(常見)에 의지하는 것이고, ‘무유에 대한 갈애’는 사후에 모든 것이 파괴된다는 견해인 단견(斷見)에 의지하는 것이다. 그런데, 일각에선 ‘유에 대한 갈애’와 ‘무유에 대한 갈애’를 그 토대가 되는 신체적 낙(樂)과 고(苦)에 대한 감수[受]로만 설명되어야 한다고 보는 시각이 있다. 하지만 니까야(Nikāya)를 비롯한 빠알리(Pāli) 문헌을 살펴보면 갈애가 육근, 오온의 행위 및 대상 전체와 관련된다는 경증을 발견할 수 있다. 만일 신체적 감수로만 그 외연을 한정한다면 본래의 포괄적 성격이 제한될 우려가 있다. 수행에 있어서 갈애의 기능과 중요성에도 불구하고 지금까지 학계에서 체계적인 논의는 본격적으로 이루어지지 않고 있다. 이에 따라 본 연구는 갈애에 대한 개념적 이해의 지평을 넓히고 그 수행적 위상에 주의를 환기시키는 계기가 될 수 있을 것이다.","This study aims to identify performative status by examining the meaning and nature of craving (渴愛), which is the main cause of suffering (苦), and exploring the conditions under which it arises (生起) and how to make it disappear. Since craving is the source of all suffering, the cessation of craving means Nirvana as the end of suffering. To the extent that it can be said that the Buddhist method of practice is concentrated in the direction to extinguish craving, craving is regarded as a key element that must be purified.Craving is usually divided into three types: craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being (bhava, 有), and craving for nothingness (vibhava, 無有). This goes beyond a mere formal and schematic classification and becomes a condition for craving each. Craving for being refers to obsession with sang-gyeon (常見), the view that the self (我) and the world (界) persist. Craving for nothingness is the obsession with dan-gyeon (斷見), the view that everything is destroyed after death. Some believe that these two cravings should be understood only as a response to sensation (受) for pleasure (樂) and suffering (苦), which are its foundations. However, in Pāli literature including the nikāyas, craving for the dhamma (法) is specified as the object of the faculty of mind (意根). Affirmation is given that craving is related to acts of the sixfold sense bases, the five aggregates, and the whole subject. Nevertheless, if the explicit meaning of craving is limited only to the response of the sensual, there is a problem that its comprehensive character will be reduced. Despite the function and importance of craving in the practice of Buddhism, systematic discussions have not been held in earnest in academia until now. The results of this study can serve as an opportunity to broaden the conceptual understanding of craving and draw attention to the performative status."
고전요가의 ‘śabda’(말)에 대한 관점 __Yogabhāṣya를 중심으로__,2021,"['소리', '의미', '관계', '소리의 힘', '관행', 'sound(śabda)', 'meaning(artha)', 'relation(sambandha)', 'power(śakti)', 'convention(saṃketa)']","일찍이 고대인도 종교·철학 학파들은 언어에 대한 높은 수준의 논의를 전개하였다. 언어에 대한 논의는 비단 문법학파(Vaiyākāraṇa)에만 국한된 것이 아니었다. Yogasūtra에서 시작된 고전요가체계에서도 ‘소리’(śabda)와 ‘의미’(artha)의 본질에 관한 언어학적 사유가 발견된다.여기에서 언어는 주로 음성언어인 ‘말’을 일컫는다. 말은 소리와 의미로 이루어져 있으며, 화자(話者)의 인식은 ‘소리’라는 매체를 통해서 청자(聽者)에게 전달된다. 소리로 전달되는 말의 의미는 인식을 담고 있다. 고전요가체계에서 말을 중요시하는 이유도 바로 말과 인식, 특히 말과 삼매(samādhi)의 연관성에 있다. Yogasūtra에 따르면, 삼매는 말로 표현 가능한 대상에 대한 분별로부터 시작된다.본고에서는 Yogasūtra와 이에 대한 최초의 주석으로 알려진 Bhāṣya를 중심으로 고전요가 초기의 말에 대한 관점을 살펴보려고 한다. 특히 Bhāṣya의 언어와 관련된 주석은 후대의 주석들과는 조금 다르다는 점에서 의미가 있으며, 아직까지 많이 알려져 있지 않다. 본고에서는 가장 권위 있는 최초의 주석을 중심으로 수트라의 저자인 Patañjali의 언어에 대한 관점에 대해서 파악하려고 한다. 이와 같은 고찰은 고전요가 초기의 언어관에 주안점을 두고 있지만, 다른 학파들과의 언어관 비교연구에도 도움이 될 수 있을 것이다.","In the Classical Yoga system, the role of words is considered to be important in relation of cognition as a starting point of meditation (vitarka samādhi), where language and cognition partially begin to coincide.Words are made up of sounds and meanings. Considering these two aspects of speech, I made this research based on the two sides of phonetics and semantics.The Sanskrit word śabda means sounds, words as well as verbal testimony. Sounds can be classified as a genus (jāti), as it has universality and the particulars. Words as a kind of sounds, it also has this characteristic of sounds, which makes differences between the sounds and its meaning (cognition) in ordinary speech. But in the case of coincidence of conception between a speaker and the listener(s), it can be a verbal testimony, being recognized as one of valid proofs.And the Classical Yoga acknowledges three phases of phonetic units called syllable sounds (dhvani), word sounds (nāda) and sentence sounds (śabda). It is the meaning that is conveyed through these media of sounds, sounds are converted into meanings through grammatical analysis.It is one of the characteristics of Yoga system that the sentence meaning (śabdārtha) is relatively emphasized as an indivisible semantic units. However, the underlying matters, such as the motives of the speaker are only mentioned to be superimposed on the Consciousness (Puruṣa). But the terms of ‘the motives’ itself is important in that this conception links the material aspects of sounds and the Consciousness. And this causal relation overcomes the limits of the Dualism.In addition, the Yoga system also acknowledges both the word’s capacity and the variable factor of the long time-accumulated practices as the creative sources of words. According to YBh, the meaning of a sound is primarily established by the inherent powers of sounds itself, and the meaning is revealed [re]established by the actual practices by its users. This eclectic stance is explicitly supported by Mādhava’s expositions in regards of the denotation and connotation of words, and also by Vācaspati Miśra and Vijñāna Bhikṣu’s later commentaries.In brief, the Yoga system’s perspectives of the conventionalism centered on the naturalism on the relationship between sound and meaning can be more easily understood in the context of their own peculiar relative eternalism (śāśvatavāda), which allows for changes."

The result showed that median values of heating energy consumption tend to increase as the building ages increase, regardless of heating degree days. To examine the effect of energy conservation measures for old apartments, energy simulations were conducted assuming the window replacement for Group 2 apartment, which accounts for most of the old apartment buildings. Simulation results showed that the window replacement led to the energy reduction by 19.3~47.8%, which corresponds to Group 4 or higher level of energy efficiency."

Through a review of the literature, factors that hindered the sustainability of the K-pact(The Korean Pact on Anti-Corruption and Transparency), which used to be an anti-corruption governance system, were identified. In addition, it examined how the obstacles were overcome in the process of making an innovation decision to establish the Integrity Social Public-Private Council. If the K-pact(The Korean Pact on Anti-Corruption and Transparency) was to establish a cooperative system to enhance social transparency with a social movement-like nature, the Integrity Social Public-Private Council seems to have gone through an innovation decision process to ensure the continuity of the anti-corruption governance system. In order for the Integrity Social Public-Private Council to secure sustainability through anticorruption governance, it is necessary to establish an institutional foundation. In addition, it is believed that sustainability can be secured when other public institutions recognize that anti-corruption governance is an effective tool for enhancing social transparency and preventing corruption by disseminating best practices for public institutions to choose anti-corruption governance as a means of innovation."

He also compiled lots of books including Tongguk t’onggam (東國通鑑), Tongguk yŏji sŭngnam (東國輿地勝覽), Yŏkdae yŏnp’yo (歷代年表), Tongin sihwa (東人詩話), T’aep’yŏng hanhwa kolgyejŏn (大平閑話), P’irwŏn chapki (筆苑雜記), Tongin sihmun (東人詩文).” Aside from these books, he participated in various national projects of book compilation including Tongmunsŏn (東文選), Kyŏngguk taejŏn (經國大典) as well as ŏnhae translation of Yŏnju sigyŏk (聯珠詩格) and Hwangsangok sijip (黃山谷詩集). He also composed plenty of prefaces for the books sponsored by government.As Sŏ Kŏjŏng has held the literary standards (文衡) for twenty-three years since he additionally held the position of Yemun’gwan taejehak (intendant of education of the Bureau of Arts and Letters) as Hyŏngjo p’ansŏ (minister of Justice) at the age of forty-eight, it can be said that his activities of writings and compilations not only demonstrates the achievement of a scholar official who lived in the fifteenth century, but also reveals a huge phase of court literature in that period. That is also well proved by the fact that his collective works was published by the order of the king. This paper surveys his literary activities during the reign of King Sejo and King Sŏngjong, and also illustrates the meaning that his activities have."

Six-elite modern pentathlon athletes(n=6, age 19.95yrs, height 178.8cm, weight 71.34kg, BMI 10.83%fat, BMD 1.25g/cm2) performed three-30sec WAnT with Excalliber Sports, Netherlands for anaerobic capacities. Total work, peak power, mean power, minimum power, fatigue index were assessed and the test results were summarized, and compared with those of national and international other events and athletes in this paper. And the results of study is as follows: Peak power in athlete A,B,C,D,E,F all showed higher level than those of compared team. Mean power in athlete A,C,D,E,F appeared higher than those of compared team, and in athlete B moderately higher than those of compared team. Fatigue index in athlete A,D assessed higher than those of compared team, in athlete E,F slightly higher than those of compared team. but in athlete B, C rather showed lower than those of compared team. Thus, the results of this study recommended that the lower athletes of peak and mean power must carry out aerobic and anaerobic interval training and anaerobic threshold(AT) training, and the lower athletes of fatigue index must strengthen anaerobic system and lactate tolerance training. Based on these individual comparison and evaluation results, specific personalized training methods of each individual athletes for anaerobic power and capacity were recommended, and it should be followed as an opportunity to implement them."

In the part of *Śarīrārthagāthānirdeśa (Verses on the meaning of canonical corpus and their commentary) of the Cintāmayī Bhūmi, the set of verses is quoted from early Buddhist scriptures, such as the Saṃyuktāgama. These verses sing of the process by which a yoga practitioner overcomes sexual desire and further eliminates the conceit (māna) by means of meditation, such as the contemplation of the impure, suffering and the non-self, eventually to put an end to all sufferings. There are relatively short but nonetheless interesting commentaries on these verses by an early Yogācāra scholar (or possibly scholars).  This paper has two objectives. The first objective is to present the main text of the commentary part, borrowed from my unpublished critical edition of the Śarīrārthagāthānirdeśa, and its Korean translation. Fumio Enomoto had published an edition of the entire verses of the chapter in 1989 and a few scholars have been studying these verses based on Enomoto""s edition. However, there are little studies on their commentaries because of the lack of critical edition on that part.  The second objective is to find out ‘forced interpretations’ made by the commentator(s), that is to say, to shed light on the commentator(s)’s distortion of the original meaning and intention of the verses so as to fit their contents to the system of the early Yogācāra school. One of the most noteworthy interpretations in this regard is the interpretation of the compound mānānuśaya, which should be understood as propensity for conceit, as ‘the ‘I am’ conceit and the latent tendency for sexual desire. This forced interpretation is based on the early Yogācāra""s stance that divides afflictions (kleśa) into two modes, namely the latent tendency (anuśaya) and its outburst (paryavasthāna). Consequently, the samādhi of signlessness (ānimittasamādhi), which initially intended to uproot the conceit (māna), comes to relate with the elimination of the latent tendency for sexual desire."

In classical Sanskrit poetry, likewise, various alaṃkāras are mentioned as technical devices that convey the poets’ intentions and express poetic beauty.In this paper, I try to estimate how some alaṃkāra techniques can be interpreted in modern popular art beyond the temporal and genre gaps through the film < Burning >. The < Burning >, directed by Lee Chang-dong, is based on the Barn Burning (1983) by Haruki Murakami.As one of the methods of reading the film, I will briefly mention how to understand it from the perspective of Indian philosophy or Buddhism concerning the discourse of perception and existence directly or indirectly revealed in the film. Through this, I examine the metaphors and narratives discussed in the film and try to analyze the meaning of the consequences of these elements, based on one of the rhetoric devices of classical Sanskrit literature, especially utprekṣā mentioned in the Kāvyālaṃkāra by Bhāmaha. In this sense, 'burning a vinyl greenhouse' in the film can be interpreted metaphorically as 'killing a woman' by the feature of ascription of utprekṣā even if there is no common attribute between the two, that is upamāna and upameya.The film demonstrates a process in which the perception of an object, which is subjective and full of uncertainty, is re-recognized as a world with certainty in the artist (of hero of the movie)'s creation.At last, it shows that the ambiguity of perception ends in literary consequences. In the end, the uncertainty, ambiguity, and borderline that constantly are revealed through psychological triggers and the open narrative of the movie < Burning > are the logic and awareness of art that more clearly reveals the incomprehensible reality and the absurdity/ irony of reality."

Nobody can escape from death, and everybody knows that they will die someday. However, talking about death is taboo in both Western and Eastern cultures. People live their present lives as if they will never die. They only face up to the reality of death when death stares them in the face. If people think of death as a part of life, human beings would accept their death naturally as they accept their birth. Nonetheless, they tend to deny the fact that they are going to dying. Therefore, this study concerns what people are afraid when they face death and dying based on some cases of the dying. In order to find the basis of fear of the dying, I revisit Elisabeth Kubler Ross’ On Death and Dying, and look into interview with terminally ill patients that Kübler Ross conducted. Recently, there are few death related studies in Korea, specifically about the fear of death and dying. Thus, On Death and Dying provides abundant sources of how terminally ill patents experience the process of dying. The result shows that they fear being alone, losing their dignity, and feeling worthless and hopeless, and this study found that these fears relate to personal relationships to which have been connected in life. The cases are examined from socio-cultural and pastoral theological perspectives on death and dying, and the result of analysis is applied to pastoral care and counseling. Death is inevitable; also, fear of death and dying is natural emotion. The one thing people have to recognize is that people need to live their lives thinking of death. It will help them reduce their fear of death. If people think of their lives separate from death, the fear of death and dying becomes bigger. Thus, it is important for people to integrate life into death when the time comes for the wholeness of their lives. In addition, I suggest that pastors provide with death education, which will support meaning of life and death according to Christian faith."

Methods One-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 nursing students who participated in writing reflective journal in the pharmacology class. Data were collected from September 2 to December 10, 2018. The grounded theory approach of Corbin and Strauss was adopted to analyze the data obtained through in-depth interviews. Results Core phenomenon of this study was ‘slow but steady’. A causal condition was ‘endlessness of creating a reflective journal’. Contextual conditions were ‘time consuming’ and ‘difficulties in transferring learning habits’. Intervention conditions were ‘trying not to delay’ and ‘a new mind’. Action/interaction strategies were ‘rumination’, ‘self-feedback’, and ‘iterative learning’. Consequences were ‘expansion of knowledge’ and ‘transition to leading learning habits’. Conclusion As the result of this study, it was found that nursing students experience of participation in reflection study was a process of searching for a true learning method. Reflection learning is necessary not only in pharmacology but also in other subjects and it is also necessary to develop an educational program that can provide diverse learning experiences in addition to reflective learning."

When the relational data does not exist directly, a social network can be configured by calculating relational data such as attribute similarity from attribute data of entities and using it as links. In this paper, the composition method of the social network using the attribute similarity between entities as a connection relationship, and the clustering method using subgroups for the configured social network are suggested, and the clustering effectiveness of the clustering results is evaluated. The analysis results can vary depending on the type and characteristics of the data to be analyzed, the type of attribute similarity selected, and the criterion value. In addition, the clustering effectiveness may not be consistent depending on the its evaluation method. Therefore, selections and experiments are necessary for better analysis results. Since the analysis results may be different depending on the type and characteristics of the analysis target, options for clustering, etc., there is a limitation. In addition, for performance evaluation of clustering, a study is needed to compare the method of this paper with the conventional method such as k-means."

Total five climate types, Cfa, Cfb, Cwa, Dwa, and Dwb were identified in ROK based on the Köppen’s climate classification criteria. Subtropical climate types, Cfa or Cwa types were broadly covered with 79.9% of 219 stations and the most of remaining stations were included in Dwa types which had a very cold winter and hot summer with wet conditions.In the Trewartha classification, four climate types were identified, one subtropical Cfa, and three temperate Doa, Dca, and Dcb types. Dcb types were found at four stations (Daegwallyeong, Taebaek, Jinburyeong, and Sabuk) in Taebak mountains indicating the extent of cool summer climate types with more stations in mountain areas. The climate characteristics by climate types only were presented the results from the Trewartha classification with the new normals and 66 ASOS stations because Köppen’s climate classification was not appropriate for ROK. The annual mean precipitation of Cfa was the greatest while Dcb the lowest among four types. The annual range was the greatest at Dca types while the smallest at Cfa due to the geographical varieties. More detailed climate types were located in ROK with 219 weather stations and the new normals (1991-2020). However, there were some limitation applying the criteria of Köppen’s and Trewartha’s climate classification to a very complex topographical region."

The bakufu had admitted the Chōsen-Tsūkō, the communication to Joseon, as the role of Tsushima. But at the late 17th century the trade with Joseon started to wan, Tsushima insisted that it has to be kept to maintain the Chōsen-Tsūkō. As the result, Tsushima preserved their privilege by the bakufu. In the meantime, Tsushima started to recognize themselves as the Hampei, a bordered region toward foreign lands. At the same time, Tsushima’s assertions against the bakufu were gradually linked to the logic of Ikoku-osae, the control of foreign invasions. Under these circumstances, Tsushima petitioned for the preservation of the right to trade which had been their financial source of the military readiness of Hampei, since the Tokugawa Ieyasu’s order. Furthermore, they insisted that Tsūkō is an important role that keeps Joseon as a breakwater against the Xing’s invasion. As a result, on the discourse of Tsushima in the early 18th century, the Chōsen-Tsūkō came to exist as a means of maintaining the balance in foreign relations and as an aspect of Ikoku-osae. Finally, it is suggested that the logical concept and structure asserted by Tsushima in the early 18th century was developed into the discourse on the role of Chōsen-osae used in negotiations with the bakufu in the latter half of the 18th century."

However, the history of human thoughts is bound to be integrated because various and heterogeneous thoughts constantly move forward in mutual influence beyond regions and times. Since interpenetrating Buddhism is not a unique characteristic of Korea, for productive discussions, it is necessary to investigate the nature of Buddhism’s Korean interpenetration and confirm the consistent basis of its worldview.The purpose of this paper is to grasp Tanheo(呑虛, 1913~1983)’s integrated idea of Confucianism-Buddhism-Daoism in succession with Choi, Chi-won(崔致遠, 857~?)’s “Profound and Mystical Dao(Hyun-Myo-jido 玄妙之道)” revealing that the interpenetrating view of Korean Buddhism is based on the worldview of inactual Becoming theory.First of all, it was revealed that the meaning of “Interdependent Arising(緣起法)”, the basic perspective of Tanhe as a monk, is an interdependent principle of creation that constantly emerges without a fixed invariant substance.In addition, the “Change(易)” philosophy of Confucianism, one of the pillars of the three religions, also shares the foundation of the worldview of creation centered on change in that it emphasizes the creative activity of heaven and earth.Finally, I would like to find the origin of Tanhe’s integrated identity in Choi Chi-won’s mention of “Profound and Mystical Dao”(玄妙之道) and “The Flow of Wind”(風流). “Hyun-Myo”(玄妙) is a collective unconscious prototype of Korean culture, which is the core of cultural identity and independent subjectivity. “Hyeon”(玄), an expression borrowed from Laozi (老子), is an irregular dynamism in which all dichotomous confrontations return to identity. It is a vital force that forever refuses to become a noun and promotes the world of phenomena in heaven and earth.Tanhe extended this Hyeon’s generative unification theory to three schools as a unified basis for integrating all dichotomy."

In particular, the claim that all living beings are tathāgata-garbha is analyzed in the 27th verse in Chapter 1 of the Ratna-gotra-vibhāga in three meanings: dharma-kāya, tathatā, and gotra. So far, there are two trends in interpreting tathāgata-garbha, using the transformation and the manifestation theories. The transformation theory interpretation is represented by Jikido Takasaki and rNgog Blo ldan shes rab, the manifestation theory by Bauddha-gotra-śāstra, translated by Jeanje, and Vajra-samādhi-sūtra-śāstra, commented by Wonhyo.  Among modern scholars, the transformation theory interpretation is mainstream, while the manifestation theory has recently emerged. According to the transformation theory, tathāgatagarbha and buddha-dhātu · bauddha-gotra are the saṃskṛta-dharma, which exists as possibility · hetu to all living beings. On the other hand, according to the manifestation theory, the amala-tathatā ․ buddha-dhātu or tathāgata-dharma-kāya · buddha-dhātu that all living beings contain is the asaṃskṛta-dharma that is covered or appears depending on the presence or the absence of kleśa-kośa.  Jeanje interprets tathāgata-garbha from the perspective of the Yogācāra School, while Wonhyo interprets it based on Anūna-anadhika-sūtra and Śrīmālā-devī-si􀎥ha-nāda-sūtra. Specifically “sarva-sattvās tathāgata-garbhāḥ” described in Tathāgata-garbha-sūtra is interpreted as “all living beings are bauddha-gotra who contains amala-tathatā ․ buddha-dhātu inside.” by Jeanje, and “all living beings contain tathāgata-dharma-kāya · buddha-dhātu inside, but all living beings are bauddha-gotra who is covered in kleśa-kośa.” by Wonhyo.  Until now, the tathāgata-garbha thought has been known to claim that all living beings has tathāgata-garbha (the cause of becoming tathāgata) and bauddha-gotra (the possibility of becoming buddha). But according to Wonhyo’s view, the tathāgata-garbha thought is the idea that all living beings are naturally tathāgata · buddha. Specifically, the tathāgata-garbha thought suggests that dhātu in all living beings (gotra) is tathāgata · buddha, but that dhātu is still covered in kleśa-kośa. This idea is the tathāgata-garbha thought that the 27th verse in Chapter 1 of the Ratna-gotra-vibhāga is trying to present."

The data are based on naturally occurring ELF conversations among the international students at a university in the U.K., and Conversation Analysis (CA) approach was adopted to identify and analyse mechanisms of other-repair strategies in the data. The findings suggest that ELF speakers engage in diverse clarification and repair strategies to clarify unclear messages of the others’ talk and to offer elaboration and support in co-construction of meanings. The participants are found to employ other-repair strategies of lexical replacement, interpretive summarising, and lexical supporting. The ELF speakers in the data display and confirm their own understanding to the others by replacing and modifying troublesome items for explicitness and attempt to resolve ambiguity and uncertainty to achieve mutual understanding. Repair is not limited to rectify linguistic perturbation, but it is extended to comprehensible clarity and explicitness in a broader sense. The result of the study supports that ELF speakers do not take understanding for granted, but they work hard to achieve it by pre-empting understanding troubles before the occurrence and promoting explicitness."

To this end, this study had classified the answers to the open-ended questions using a Structural Topic Model and K-means clustering. After splitting the sample according to the gender of the respondents, it performed the multinomial logistic regression analysis. The analysis results are as follows. First, the attitude toward the #MeToo movement classifies its aspects as a) ‘Egalitarianism’ which agrees with both the victim statement itself and the social movement for gender equality; b) ‘Law and Order’ that trusts the victim statement but opposes the social movement, and; c) ‘Skepticism’ that disagrees with both. Second, lower the age, the greater probability to have a skeptical attitudes in all groups. Third, hostile sexism critically weakens the egalitarian attitudes in all groups, but benevolent sexism abates the Law and Order attitude only within women. Fourth, the right-wing authoritarian tendency reinforces Law and Order attitude in all groups, and the social dominance orientation stresses Law and Order only within women. Overall, the forcible and most consistent influence on the #MeToo movement are age, hostile sexism, and right-wing authoritarian tendencies. Since these analysis results are different from the theoretical assumptions about the effects of traditional patriarchal or authoritarianism, additional empirical investigation and analysis shall follow in the future. And it is hoped that this study can contribute to the refinement of theoretical premises and indicators when measuring gender-related values in the future."

For this study, a 38-year-old married woman who had lost her companion animal two months ago was selected as the subject and was conducted a grief-focused art therapy program based on the five stages of grief model of Kübler-Ross 1-2 times a week: 70 min., per session and 34 sessions in total from April 4, 2019, to January 30, 2020. As study tools, Pet Bereavement Questionnaire (PBQ) and Korean Version of Beck's Depression Inventory Version II(K-BDI-II) were used for pre-, post-, and follow-up comparisons, and as a projective test, House-Tree-Person (HTP) was used for pre-, post-, and follow-up qualitative comparisons. In addition, each session and each stage of the program was analyzed qualitatively with session-specific art therapy observation records. The study findings are as follows. First, the scores in the domains of grief/sadness, trauma, and guilt decreased, and the score in adult female depression was significantly reduced. This change can also be found in HTP, which suggests that grief-focused art therapy positively influences adult female grief alleviation and depression reduction. Second, as a result of examining the changes in sessions and stages of grief and depression in an adult female who had lost her companion animal, it was found that she could accept the reality of her loss of companion animal and discern the meaning of new life through the art therapy process and the outputs. Positive changes emerged as she perceived the changes of depression and returned to everyday life. Based on these results, this study suggested the effectiveness of grief-focused art therapy for an adult female who has lost a companion animal to alleviate grief and reduce depression. In this regard, it is significant in that this study provided the fundamental data for both feasibilities in the art therapy settings and follow-up studies."

From the point of philosophical history, people may say 『Yuānhǎizipíng(淵海子平)』 is just a book of superstition, but I would like to study this book with two great significances. First, you can look at a section of Chinese philosophy based on the principle of 『Zhōuyì』 in a large category. Second, it is to look at the differences between state-led and private-sector 『Yì(易)』.『Zipíngyuānhǎiyīnyìxiángzhù(子平淵海音義詳註)』 was compiled by Xúshēng(徐升), and reinforced by Yángzōng(楊宗), Zhútíng(竹亭) of the Míng Dynasty. At the beginning of this book, the order of the Cosmology, generation from Tàiyì(太易) to Taiji(太極) is described in the order of ‘Tàiyì → Tàichū(太初) → Tàishĭ(太始) → Tàisù(太素) → Taiji’, which is also a process of change of ‘qì(氣, 太初) → xíng(形, 太始) → zhì(質, 太素) → xíng·tǐ(形·體, 太極). What I question is the use of ’tǐ (體)’ in xíngtǐ. 『Yuānhǎizipíng(淵海子平)』’s assertion about wǔyùn(五運) is somewhat different from 「Qiánzáodù(乾鑿度)」 or 「Qiánkūnzáodù(乾坤鑿度)」 of 『Yìwěi(易緯)』 or 『Xiàojīng, Gōumìngjué(孝經緯․鉤命訣)』 in the Han Dynasty, when the mention of Taiji began. It is also different from the arguments of Wangbi(王弼) of Wei Dynasty in the middle period or those of Kǒng Yǐngdá(孔穎達) of the Tang Dynasty. In addition, as a condition that must be preceded to solve this problem, it was to clarify which dimension of 『Yuānhǎizipíng(淵海子平)』’s Taiji between ‘yǒu(有)’ and ‘wú(無). Therefore, I compared and analyzed their Taiji(Han dynasty, Wangbi, Kǒng Yǐngdá) and 『Yuānhǎizipíng(淵海子平)』.Through this study, I carefully inferred that the meaning of the ’tǐ’ of the ‘xíng·tǐ’ in 『Yuānhǎizipíng』 refers to ‘tǐ’ as a ‘principle’ or ‘cause’ that produces ‘qiánkūn(乾坤)’, not a ‘xíng’ or a ‘zhì’. Second, I found that the system of 『Yì(易)』 organized by the state and that organized voluntarily by the private sector is similar in a large frame."

In order to achieve the purpose of the study, a program for strengthening communication competencies was applied to three 5th graders of ‘D’ Elementary School and 69 students. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, class reflection diary prepared by the supervisor, and open-ended questionnaire prepared by students after class, and data analysis was conducted through inductive category analysis and hermeneutic cycle. As a result of the study, in terms of the operation of the interdisciplinary convergence program centered on communication competency, ‘Teacher K’ who taught the program said that while feeling the freedom of curriculum design, it had difficulties. It was discussed that elementary school teachers teach multiple subjects, so they are free to integrate content elements for each subject when implementing the curriculum, but there may be difficulties due to the lack of experience in designing the framework of the national-level curriculum. He was thrilled with the process of applying the new program, and at the same time felt a sense of frustration. The necessity of reviewing the arrangement of content elements for each subject was raised in the practice of the teacher's curriculum. It was possible to recognize that the process of non-verbal communication is also important in the practical context of the game. In spite of the difficulty of process-based evaluation, self-evaluation was suggested as a methodologically practical alternative. The effects of the interdisciplinary convergence program centered on communication skills were ‘the joy of team activities’, ‘acquisition of communication skills’, ‘solving conflicts through team activities’, and ‘creating an intersubjective relationship of recognition order.’ As a suggestion for follow-up research, it was suggested that follow-up studies to correct and supplement the problems of the program are necessary."

대학축구선수의 부위별 근력수준과 슈팅스피드 및 정확도와의 관계연구,2021,"['isokinetic contraction', 'shooting speed', 'college soccer players']","본 연구의 목적은 축구 선수들의 슈팅능력과 발목 및 무릎 관절의 등속성 근기능 관련성을 분석하여 슈팅 능력(속도)을 향상시키기 위한 트레이닝의 기초자료를 제공하는데 있다. 피험자는 2018-2019년 대한축구협회 K3리그에 소속된 남자 축구선수를 대상으로 하였으며, 인스텝 슈팅, 인프런트 슈팅의 속도를 측정하여 킥 능력을 중위 50%로 구분하여 각 슈팅별로 집단 내 우수그룹(n=20)과 집단내 비우수그룹(n=10)으로 분류한 후 신체적 특성을 측정하여 동질성 검정을 실시하였다. 이후 모든 대상자는 2차 측정으로 등속성 근기능 측정장비를 이용하여 발목 및 무릎관절의 등속성 근기능을 측정하였다. 얻어진 등속성 근기능의 결과 중 근력요소(절대 최대근력, 상대 최대근력, 동측근력비, 양측근력비), 위치요소(최대근력 발현각도)를 우수집단과 비우수집단으로 구분하여 분석하였다. 자료처리는 SPSS ver. 22.0 통계 패키지를 이용하였고, 각 슈팅별 집단의 측정 항목별 기술통계치 평균(M)과 표준편차(SD)를 산출하였고, 동질성검증을 위해 Levene의 등분산 검증을 실시하였으며 각 슈팅별 집단 내 우수집단과 비우수집단의 등속성 근기능의 차이를 검증하기 위해 독립 t검정을 실시하였고 유의수준은 α=.05로 하였다. 인스텝 슈팅 능력에 따른 무릎 및 발목관절 근력요소의 비교에서는 무릎 관절의 신전근의 최대근력과 상대 최대근력에서 A그룹이 B그룹에 비해 유의하게 높은 것으로 나타났고, 발목 관절의 배측굴곡근과 저측굴곡근의 절대최대근력, 상대최대근력에서도 A그룹이 B그룹에 비해 유의하게 높은 것으로 나타났다. 인프런트 슈팅 능력에 따른 무릎 및 발목관절 근력요소의 비교에서는 무릎관절의 신전근의 절대최대근력과 상대최대근력에서 A그룹이 B그룹에 비해 유의하게 높은 것으로 나타났고, 발목관절의 배측굴곡의 절대최대근력과 상대최대근력에서 또한 A그룹이 B그룹에 비해 유의하게 높은 것으로 나타났다.  이 연구를 통해 인사이드 슈팅능력은 집단 내 슈팅 능력 우수집단과 비우수집단 간 발목관절의 배측굴곡근을 제외한 하지 근기능의 근력요소, 위치요소, 시간요소에서 유의한 차이가 나타나지 않은 반면, 인스텝 슈팅 능력과 인프런트 슈팅 능력은 집단 내 우수집단과 비우수집단 간 무릎 및 발목의 등속성 근 기능에서 유의한 차이가 나타났다고 설명할 수 있다. 따라서 이 연구를 통해 슈팅 능력을 향상시키기 위해서는 기술적인 훈련 이외에 무릎관절의 신전근, 발목관절의 저측굴곡과 배측굴곡의 기능 등 전반적인 하지의 근기능을 향상시키는 훈련이 필요할 것으로 사료된다.","The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between shooting ability and isokinetic muscle function of ankle and knee joints of soccer players and to provide basic data for training to improve shooting speed. The subjects were male soccer players who belonged to the K3 league of the Korea Football Association from 2018-2019. The speed of in-step shooting and in-front shooting were measured and classified into excellent group(n=20) and non-excellent group(n=10) in each group. The subjects were tested for homogeneity by measuring physical characteristics of the subjects, and the isokinetic muscle function of ankle and knee joints was measured by using isokinetic muscle function measurement equipment as a secondary measurement. Among the results of isokinetic muscular function, muscle strength and position factors were classified into excellent and non-excellent groups. Data processing is done using SPSS ver. 22.0 statistical package. The mean of descriptive statistics(M) and standard deviation(SD) were calculated for each group of shooting, and Levene""s equivariance test was conducted to verify homogeneity. In order to verify the difference of isokinetic muscular function between the excellent group and the non-excellent group in each group of shooting, independent t-test was conducted and the significance level was =.05. In the comparison of knee and ankle joint muscle strength factors according to the in-step shooting ability, group A was significantly higher than group B in the maximum muscle strength and relative maximum muscle strength of the knee joint. The absolute maximum muscle strength and relative maximum muscle strength of the dorsal flexor and the lower flexor of the ankle joint were significantly higher in group A than in group B. The comparison of knee and ankle joint muscle strength factors according to the in front shooting ability. The absolute maximum muscle strength and relative maximum muscle strength of the extensor muscle of the knee joint were significantly higher in group A than in group B. The absolute maximum muscle strength and relative maximum muscle strength of the dorsal flextion of the ankle joint were significantly higher in group A than in group B. In this study, there was no significant difference in muscle strength, position, and time factors of lower limb muscle function except for the dorsal flexor of ankle joint in comparison between the group with excellent shooting ability and the group with no excellent shooting ability. However, the in-step shooting ability and the infront shooting ability showed significant differences in the isokinetic muscle function of the knee and ankle between the excellent and non-excellent groups in the group. Therefore, in order to improve shooting ability, it is necessary to improve the general lower limb muscle function such as extension muscle of knee joint, lower side bending of ankle joint and function of dorsal bending in addition to technical training."
스마트미터 데이터 활용 방법에 대한 연구,2021,,,"This work introduces a new approach that classifies individual household water usage by examining the characteristics of smart meter end-user demand data. Here, one of the most well-known unsupervised machine learning, K-means algorithm, is applied to classify water consumptions by each household. The intensity and duration of end-user demands are used as main features to determine the households with similar water consumption pattern. The results showed that 21 households are classified into 13 clusters with each cluster having one, two, three, or five houses. The reasoning why multiple households are classified into the same cluster is described in this paper with respect to the collected data and end-user water consumption behavior."

The NIMS-KMA produces new future projections using the ensemble mean of KMA Advanced Community Earth system model (K-ACE) and UK Earth System Model version1 (UKESM1) simulations to provide scientific information of future climate changes. In this study, we analyze four experiments those conducted following the new shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) based scenarios to examine projected climate change in the twenty-first century. Present day (PD) simulations show high performance skill in both climate mean and variability, which provide a reliability of the climate models and reduces the uncertainty in response to future forcing. In future projections, global temperature increases from 1.92 °C to 5.20 °C relative to the PD level (1995–2014). Global mean precipitation increases from 5.1% to 10.1% and sea ice extent decreases from 19% to 62% in the Arctic and from 18% to 54% in the Antarctic. In addition, climate changes are accelerating toward the late twenty-first century. Our CMIP6 simulations are released to the public through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) international data sharing portal and are used to support the establishment of the national adaptation plan for climate change in South Korea."

Methods : One hundred students (the mean age of 25.2±1.63) underwent objective refraction using three types of autorefractor including open-fied, closed type and hand-held type (Nvision-k 5001P, KR-8100P and Righton Retinomax K-plus). Subjective refraction for all was performed by an experienced optometrist without reference of autorefractors’ results. The difference of results between three autorefractors and subjective refraction was compared. Results : With the result of subjective refraction, the difference was shown minimum with open-view autorefractor followed by closed-view and hand-held autorefractor, which is significant difference among the devices (p<0.001). In addition, there was significant difference between subjective and objective refractions in spherical equivalent. The difference was minimum with open-view autorefractor followed by closed-view and hand-held autorefractor (p<0.001). Conclusion : The difference between open-view and closed-view type of autorefractor was not significant. Therefore, the results from these devices would be a good reference for subjective refraction. However, attention needs to be taken for held-held type as it may stimulate accommodation or cause measurement error."

As a follow-up study, we investigated the effects of OLED and LED at a different color temperature (3,000 K) on melatonin profile, sleep, and vigilance.Methods 24 healthy subjects (27.5±5.1 years) were exposed to three light conditions [OLED, LED, and dim light (DL)] from 17:30 to 24:00, in a random order and with a 1-week interval. Saliva samples for melatonin were taken every hour from 18:00 to 24:00. Polysomnography (PSG) and a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) were performed.Results Melatonin onset time was significantly delayed under OLED and LED compared with DL, with no significant difference between OLED and LED. The mean melatonin level at 24:00 under LED was lower than that under DL, but there was no significant difference between OLED LE and DL. The percentage of slow wave sleep (N3) in LED was significantly lower than in OLED.Conclusion Exposure to light in the evening can suppress melatonin secretion late at night and disturb deep sleep, and those effects are slightly worse under LED than OLED."

Additionally, low-yield nuclear weapons can be evaluated as having the capability, communication of nuclear retaliation wills and possibilities, and credibility for these wills and capabilities, which are 3C elements of deterrence in that they are “possible-use nuclear weapons.” Hence, they can be evaluated as highly-applicable deterrence means. As North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities have advanced and the U.S. is developing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, this article intends to make several suggestions regarding deterrence and response. First, because North Korea's policy to strengthen its tactical nuclear capabilities in 2021 is inevitably closely related to the technical characteristics of the development of low-yield nuclear weapons, it should be evaluated and prepared in connection with this. Second, it is necessary to understand the Biden administration's nuclear strategy regarding the extended deterrence strategy of the U.S. and discuss it closely based on the 5th NPR unveiled in early 2022. Third, to ensure the credibility of the R.O.K.-U.S. tailored deterrence strategy, “multilateral deterrence measures” must be considered at the regional level, including low-yield nuclear weapons."

Data regarding the radiographic grade, self-reported weight change during the past year, physical activity, level of knee pain, and health-related quality of life (EuroQOL five- dimension (EQ-5D) index) were collected. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify factors significantly associated with the level of knee pain and health-related quality of life in subgroups according to the body mass index (BMI) range (≤ 22.5, between 22.6 and 27.5, and > 27.5 kg/m2).Results: In the whole group, the level of knee pain was significantly associated with K-L grade (P < 0.001), and EQ-5D was negatively associated with age (P < 0.001), the level of knee pain (P < 0.001), and weekly hours of vigorous-intensity activity (P = 0.026). In the subgroup analysis, weight gain showed significant association with the level of knee pain only in women with 22.5 kg/m2 < BMI ≤ 27.5 kg/m2 (P = 0.006). Weight gain showed significant association with EQ-5D in women with BMI ≤ 22.5 kg/m2 (P = 0.047) whereas weekly hours of moderate-intensity activity was negatively associated with EQ-5D in women with BMI > 27.5 kg/m2.Conclusions: The association of weight change and physical activity with knee pain and health-related quality of life might be different according to BMI ranges. Well-designed interventions to improve both knee pain and health-related quality of life need to be investigated in future studies that would strictly control physical activity, diet, and weight changes."

To this purpose, this study uses the extended conceptual metaphor theory of Kövecses(2020) and studies practical use cases using the news database. According to the four bit orders proposed by the theory of extended conceptual metaphor, we try to analyze the implementation with the ideological relationship and frequency number of the meaning elements appearing in this bit order. The results show that the heterogeneity of the cognitive mechanisms could be found when expressing the same topic in Korean and Chinese through conceptual metaphors, like disease, which is subjective and sensitive. Based on the latest results of conceptual metaphor theory, we try to overcome previous studies on the composition of metaphor meanings and propose new comparative analysis, which can find the originality of this study."

The prediction model takes seven temperature sensors at point k and seven heater power at point k as prediction variables and seven temperature sensor values at point k+Δt as response variables. In this paper, we propose a novel method in the form of a mixture of physics-based and data-driven models. 1) We establish a model in the form of formulas using the first law of thermodynamics, 2) extract features from sensor data corresponding to the form of formulas, and extract the modulus of formulas using regression techniques. This has two differentiating points compared to ANN, a representative black-box model. 1) It is possible to learn models with high prediction accuracy with less data. 2) Interpretation of the model is possible because the coefficients of the learned model have physical meaning. The temperature prediction using the proposed method resulted in 1.5x higher accuracy compared to ANN."

For the construction of the fabric database, 287 woven fabrics were examined by using the CLO fabric kit, KES-FB system, and drape test system. The k-means cluster analysis method was used to classify the fabrics into 7 grades. After correlation analysis of the fabric properties for each experiment, similar properties of the CLO fabric kit and KES-FB system were chosen, which were then designed to extract similar fabrics from the database. It was confirmed that inferring the drape information and objective hand feeling of fabrics was to some extent possible by extracting similar fabrics from the database. In this study, the primary hand and total hand value(THV) of KES-FB system, which was constructed by Kawabata and other experiments, were used to quantify the objective hand feeling, because they are the most widely used. However, these standards can be changed over time; in order to be applied within the clothing industry, these standards may have to be changed to some extent. Moreover, it is notable that although objective hand feeling cannot be expressed in the 3D virtual costume program, it can be easily derived from the constructed database. Additionally, it is expected that the existing 3D virtual costume program will express the costumes more realistically by improving these results."

This means that the degree of information asymmetry appears to be high for companies that frequently receive the inquired disclosure requests. Second, the higher the ratio of ‘pending’ response to the inquired disclosure requests or the number of responses for single request, the higher the stock price crash risk. This means that the positive relation between the inquired disclosure and stock price crash risk is primarily derived from companies disclosing ambiguous answers.[Implications]To our knowledge, this study reveals for the first time that the inquired disclosure regulation not only protects capital market participants by mitigating information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders, but also has a side effect of providing useful information for potential investors in evaluating the information environment of the target companies."

As a result, dementia patients were classified into four types: inactive-dependent, active-problematic behavior, activity-autonomy, and inactive-offensive. Inactive-dependent type was a group with the most severe disability in cognitive and daily activity functions; however, they lacked behavioral and psychological symptoms and problematic behavior with clothes. Active-problematic behavior type showed the most behavioral and psychological problems and problematic behavior with clothes. Activity-autonomy type was a group without any problematic behaviors. Moreover, the inactive-offensive type had very good cognitive function toward humans. The study imply that it is necessary to provide clothes with proper functions based on the types of patients rather than providing them uniform clothes because clinical and clothes behaviors differ significantly depending on the types of dementia patients."

Scaling analysis of magnetic-thermal behaviors in ferromagnetic insulator LaCoO3 thin film,2021,['Second-order phase transition Magnetic entropy change Scaling LaCoO3 thin films'],,"The structure, surface topography and magnetic properties of LaCoO3 (LCO) thin films deposited epitaxially on the SrTiO3 substrates have been investigated in detail. The LCO thin films show a typical ferromagneticparamagnetic (FM-PM) phase transition at 78 K. Based on the measurements of isothermal magnetization around the Curie point, the magnetic entropy change (ΔSM) of LCO thin films under various applied magnetic fields were obtained. By utilizing scaling theory, all of the ΔSM curves can be re-scaled, confirming that the FMPM phase transition is second-order magnetic phase transition. Moreover, the magnetic entropy change -ΔSM features a maximum around TC, whereas, power law fitting of -ΔSmax M with H gives n = 0.9704, which is obviously deviating from the standard value n = 2/3 for the Landau mean field model. This indicates that the mean field theory cannot be used to explain the critical behavior of LCO thin films which implies that the critical behavior of LCO thin films may involve complex magnetic interactions. These interactions are correlated with a long-term puzzling finding in this system why its Curie point is always around 80 K regardless of the different fabrication methods and conditions used in the film growth."

The proposed method proceeds in three steps. The first is the pre-processing and feature extraction step. It collects user’s lifelog using a wearable device, removes incomplete data, errors, noise, and contradictory data, and processes missing values. Then, for feature extraction, important variables are selected through principal component analysis, and data similar to the relationship between the data are classified through correlation coefficient and covariance. In order to analyze the features extracted from the lifelog, dynamic clustering is performed through the K-means algorithm in consideration of the passage of time. The new data is clustered through the similarity distance measurement method based on the increment of the sum of squared errors. Next is to extract information about the cluster by considering the passage of time. Therefore, using the health decision-making system through feature clusters, risks able to managed through factors such as physical characteristics, lifestyle habits, disease status, health care event occurrence risk, and predictability. The performance evaluation compares the proposed method using Precision, Recall, and F-measure with the fuzzy and kernel-based clustering. As a result of the evaluation, the proposed method is excellently evaluated. Therefore, through the proposed method, it is possible to accurately predict and appropriately manage the user’s potential health risk by using the similarity with the patient."

Verbs in which one infinitive unites both perfective and imperfective meanings e.g. (impf.) napovídal mi při luštění křížovky [he gave me hints when I was solving the crossword], (pf.) hodně toho napovídal, ale málo udělal [he has talked a lot, but has done little]; D. Verbs with predominantly perfective meanings, from which a certain impf. meaning was clearly separated; for example: vejít se, hodit se, sednout (kabát mu sedne).The issues of aspectual homonymy/polysemy are closely related to the issue which factors contribute to the aspectual interpretation of an utterance. A list of examples of such factors is provided. To identify the aspectual value of an expression, it is not enough to consider morphology of the verb only. The aspectual construal of a verb is not determined by its morphology alone, it depends on the way it is used."

Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that comprehensive intervention with emphases on improving COVID-19 self-confidence, social support, and reducing stress is required to improve community health practitioner mental health. The results also indicate a need for educational programs aimed at improving the mental health of young community health practitioners."
Suspecting Intussusception and Recurrence Risk Stratification Using Clinical Data and Plain Abdominal Radiographs,2021,"['Intussusception', 'Recurrence', 'Abdominal radiographs', 'Pediatrics']",,"Purpose: Although ultrasonography is the gold standard of diagnosing intussusception, plain abdomen radiograph (AXR) is often used to make differential diagnosis for pediatric patients with abdominal pain. In intussusception patients, we aimed to analyze the AXR and clinical data to determine the characteristics of early AXR findings associated with diagnosis of intussusception and recurrence after reduction. Methods: Between January 2011 and June 2018, 446 patients diagnosed with intussusception based on International Classification of Diseases-10 code of K56.1 were admitted. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 398 patients who received air reduction; 51 of them have recurred after initial reduction. We evaluated six AXR features including absent ascending colon gas, absent transverse colon gas, target sign, meniscus sign, mass, and ileus. Clinical data and AXR features were compared between single episode and recurrence groups. Results: Two groups did not show significant differences regarding clinical data. Mean time to recurrence from air reduction was 3.4±3.2 days. Absent ascending colon gas (63.9%) was the most common feature in intussusception, followed by mass (29.1%). All of six AXR features were observed more frequently in the recurrence group. Absent transverse colon gas was the most closely associated AXR finding for recurrence (odds ratio, 2.964; 95% confidence interval, 1.327-6.618; p=0.008). Conclusion: In our study, absence of ascending colon gas was the most frequently seen AXR factor in intussusception patients. Extended and careful observation after reduction may be beneficial if such finding on AXR is found in intussusception patients."

In this study, gamma radiation of drinking spring water was measured and internal exposure dose evaluation was performed to determine its harmfulness. K-40 and uranium-based radioactivity analysis was performed through a high-purity germanium detector, and as a result, drinking water was detected somewhat higher than that of mixing water. Since there is no regulation on the natural radioactivity concentration in Korea, it was compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Drinking Water Regulations and World Health Organization standard. As a result, there were some items that exceeded standards. Internal exposure was evaluated according to the effective dose formula of ICRP 119. As the result was derived that a maximum of 1.17 mSv per year could be received. This result means that the dose limit for the general public may be exceeded, and it was judged that it is necessary to set an appropriate standard value and present a recommendation value through continuous monitoring in the future."

These regulations mean that IMO and EU urging to make efforts to reduce carbon emissions worldwide, and they have officially declared that the shipping sector can no longer enjoy preferential treatment as an unregulated industry. On top of that, Korea's shipbuilding and shipping industry cannot be an exception to this trend of the international community.Korea enacted the Eco-Friendly Ship Act in 2018 to cope with the ‘2020 Sulphur Cap’, which is considered the strongest regulation in shipping history. As the title of the law suggests, it aims to develop and support eco-friendly ship in response to various environmental regulations such as sulfur oxide regulations, but it is difficult to respond to overall environmental regulations.In addition, China, the United States, and Europe have already been operating ECA, but Korea is lagging behind this measures while enacted the Port Air Quality Act on September 1, 2020 to establish low-speed navigation zones, belatedly following air pollution regulations in the shipping sector.On the other hand, in relation to the carbon emission trading system, Korea has also introduced and implemented the Korean carbon emission trading system (K-ETS) since 2015, but it has not yet been applied to the shipping sector.As such, Korea's maritime environment-related laws are still lacking in international standards, and practical responses are more of a temporary measure than a comprehensive and systematic response.In fact, strengthening carbon emission regulations can lead to various legal problems, which will also require preemptive responses, such as explicit regulations in charter contracts, transportation contracts, and insurance contracts.From this point of view, this paper examines international discussions on carbon emissions and what legal countermeasure is in Korea.

The research and application of hedging is the most effective way to reduce the market risk. Hedging is a risk management strategy employed to offset losses in investments by taking an opposite position in a related asset. We use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to cluster companies and futures products respectively, and analyze the relationship between the number of hedging firms, regional distribution, nature of firms, capital distribution, company size, profitability, number of local Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs), regional location, and listing time. The study shows that listed companies with large scale and good profitability invest more money in hedging, while state-owned enterprises’ participation in hedging is more likely to be affected by the company size and the number of local futures commission merchants, and private enterprises are more likely to be affected by the company profitability and the regional location. Listed companies are more willing to choose long-listed and mature futures products for hedging. We also provide policy advice based on our conclusion. So far, there is no study on the characteristics of hedging. This paper fills the gap. The results provide a basis and guidance for people’s investment and risk management. Using clustering analysis in hedging study is another innovation of this paper."

The results of an online survey conducted for single-person households of Korean nationality from July 20 to July 24, 2020, were used. After categorizing each of the four variables through K-means analysis, latent class analysis(LCA) was conducted and the optimal market segmentation was determined to be seven. After identifying the characteristics of the seven groups and comparing them with the main portion of spending, it was confirmed that there were differences in dining out, clothing and luxury goods, housing costs, cultural and leisure activities, and financial activities. In particular, there was a clear difference between the groups in the items of clothing and luxury items. Also, clothing and luxury items showed significant differences between group 2 and group 7 from other groups. Group 2 and Group 7 are similar in that they emphasize economic value and prefer internal activities compared to other groups. This characteristic led to the lowest number of clothing and luxury items, distinguishing them from other groups. This study is expected to provide useful information for identifying the needs of single-person households and determining target markets for various industries related to single-person households.

Exploring the effects of speed and scale on a ship’s form factor using CFD,2021,"['Form factor', 'Ship resistance', 'Scale effects', 'Reynolds number dependence', 'Froude number dependence']",,"The problem of predicting a ship’s form factor and associated scale effects has been subject to many investigations in recent years. In this study, an attempt is made to investigate whether the form factor is influenced by a change in the ship’s speed by numerically modelling a geosim series of the KCS hull form by means of a RANS solver. The turbulence dependence of the problem is also studied by altering the closure model among three widely used approaches (the k-ω, k-ω SST, and k-ε models). The results show that at very low speeds (Froude numbers in the range of 0.02–0.06) the numerical model predicts changes in the form factor of a ship between 10% and 20%, depending on the turbulence model and scale factor choices. As the speed is increased further, the form factor exhibits little change, usually in the range of 1% or less. Simulations where the Reynolds number is changed by approximately two orders of magnitude, achieved by altering the value of viscosity, confirmed that the form factor can be considered Froude-dependent only for low speeds, predicting essentially identical values when high speed cases are considered."

Existing diplomatic methods by government representatives and diplomats have important meanings in their own right, but their influence is limited. Therefore, it is not enough to improve the national image and raise Korea's status abroad, and additional measures are necessary.To this end, a public diplomacy by the private sector is emerging, since it is expected to achieve results in a relatively short period of time and has a ripple effect on local audience. The first step was promoting Korea's culture and its values through cultural contents. For the past 20 years, contents such as Hallyu dramas and K-pop have been gaining great popularity around the world through media and internet. Fascinated by these contents, the population of foreign visitors to Korea has dramatically increased, and they came to tour, learn Korean language, or even study in Korean Universities. In fact, the increase number of visitors from foreign countries by such cultural contents is contributing to the revival of Korea's tourism industry and vitalization of the travel industry.Japan has been making efforts to form a national image by spreading its culture, knowledge, and technology to various countries abroad based on its abundant financial power. There are also a number of countries that actually benefit from these activities. At the same time, Japanese cultural contents were also spread to many overseas young people and gained great popularity. However, the influence of Japanese cultural contents is currently on a path of decline.The expansion of influence through cultural contents, which is currently mainly practiced in Korea, can be considered successful, but as can be seen in the case of Japan, changes in its influence may occur. In preparation for this, it is necessary to diversify the ways of public diplomacy in which the private sector participates."

The experimental Reynolds number was Re = 1.5 × 106, and the reduced frequency was k = 0.069. The propagation of the unsteady pressure field during the dynamic stall process was analyzed in detail. The motion characteristics of the DSV were examined, including its near-wall development characteristics and near-wall evolution velocity. Moreover, the frequency characteristics of the near-wall DSV were studied using wavelet analysis combined with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technology. In addition, the effects of the mean angle of attack (AoA) and the amplitude on the DSV motion and frequency characteristics were examined in detail. The effects of the mean AoA on the near-wall DSV strength and the propagation velocity were linear, while the effects of amplitude were nonlinear. The mean AoA and amplitude had a significant influence on the frequency of the leading-edge vortex (LEV) at the initial stage of the DSV development (x/c = 0.10–0.20).

The activation energy varies almost linearly from 0.57 eV at V GS = 2 V to 0.019 eV at V GS = 26 V then goes up to 0.071 eV at V GS = 40 V. This means that this dependence is very strong in the sub-threshold regime while it is inactivated beyond threshold voltage. The threshold voltage and the electric fi eld mobility were also found to be thermally activated. This temperature dependence may be attributed to the contribution of the density of states to the channel electrons in the sub-threshold region or to speed accumulation of electrons at the pc ZnO/SiO 2 interface. However, the contribution of this density of states beyond threshold voltage is negligible. Furthermore, the threshold voltage was found to be proportional to the electric field mobility."

Clustering the Clinical Course of Chronic Urticaria Using a Longitudinal Database: Effects on Urticaria Remission,2021,"['Chronic urticaria', 'cluster analysis', 'recurrence', 'database', 'cohort studies', 'survival analysis', 'prognosis', 'house dust mites']",,"Purpose Little is known about the clinical course of chronic urticaria (CU) and predictors of its prognosis. We evaluated CU patient clusters based on medication scores during the initial 3 months of treatment in an attempt to investigate time to remission and relapse rates for CU and to identify predictors for CU remission.Methods In total, 4,552 patients (57.9% female; mean age of 38.6 years) with CU were included in this retrospective cohort study. The K-medoids algorithm was used for clustering CU patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Cox regression was applied to identify predictors of CU remission.Results Four distinct clusters were identified: patients with consistently low disease activity (cluster 1, n = 1,786), with medium-to-low disease activity (cluster 2, n = 1,031), with consistently medium disease activity (cluster 3, n = 1,332), or with consistently high disease activity (cluster 4, n = 403). Mean age, treatment duration, peripheral neutrophil counts, total immunoglobulin E, and complements levels were significantly higher for cluster 4 than the other 3 clusters. Median times to remission were also different among the 4 clusters (2.1 vs. 3.3 vs. 6.4 vs. 9.4 years, respectively, P < 0.001). Sensitization to house dust mites (HDMs; at least class 3) and female sex were identified as significant predictors of CU remission. Around 20% of patients who achieved CU remission experienced relapse.Conclusions In this study, we identified 4 CU patient clusters by analyzing medication scores during the first 3 months of treatment and found that sensitization to HDMs and female sex can affect CU prognosis. The use of immunomodulators was implicated in the risk for CU relapse."

Translation and Validation of the Korean Version of the Forgotten Joint Score,2021,"['Knee', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Total knee arthroplasty', 'Forgotten joint score', 'Patient reported outcome measure']",,"Background: The Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) is a newly developed patient-reported outcome measure designed to evaluate clinical outcome after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The FJS is known as a sensitive test with a low ceiling effect. It has been recently translated into many languages. However, no study has reported the validity or reliability of a Korean version of the FJS (K-FJS).Thus, the purpose of this study was to address this issue.Methods: According to guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation, translation of the English version of the FJS was performed. After obtaining a license from the original developer, 150 patients who had undergone TKA at more than 1 year to less than 5 years ago completed the K-FJS, visual analog scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), and the 36- Item Short Form (SF-36) health survey. To measure test-retest reliability, the K-FJS was completed twice by telephone survey for 100 patients. Responsiveness was retrospectively calculated based on a survey of 50 patients at 3 months and 1 year after surgery.Results: The K-FJS exhibited an excellent reliability (Cronbach's α, 0.967; intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.958; 95% confidence interval, 0.930–0.974). The ceiling effect of the K-FJS was 8.7% (n = 13), which was lower than the WOMAC's ceiling effect (10%).There was no floor effect. The correlation coefficients with WOMAC and SF-36 (physical function) were 0.708 and 0.682, respectively, indicating good construct validity. However, its correlation with mental health subscale of SF-36 was low (r = 0.143). At 3 to 12 months after TKA, the standardized response mean (SRM) was 0.67, which was lower than the SRM of WOMAC (1.03) obtained in the same period. The K-FJS demonstrated strong measurement properties in terms of good construct validity and reliability.Conclusions: This study suggests that the K-FJS is an excellent instrument that can be used to monitor clinical outcomes after TKA. Using this standardized K-FJS, it would be possible for medical institutions to share more accurate clinical results."

Historians of the Pacific War assert that the Japanese deployed the ‘wazo’ tactics, and the Allies pursued ‘bypass’ tactics in battles. As the first step in dismantling of such stereotype, the paper reviews errors between Chinese character translations as empirical consideration for the wazo tactics. Subsequently, the paper compares the usage of the words ‘wazo’ and ‘leapfrog’ to evaluate the implications of the two terms in war context.Furthermore, the paper traces by literature type and chronology the unique portrayal of ‘island hopping’ from the American and U.K. perspectives. In the process, the paper uncovered the differences and similarities between ‘leapfrog’ and ‘island hopping’. Finally, the paper examined MacArthur, who serves as the center point for the Pacific War converges.MacArthur claimed that the Navy’s operation was unfair during the war, and this point was reproduced to glorify and heroify the Pacific War in other nations.However, in the historicalization of the war, the term ‘island hopping,’ which he called as a unique method of the navy, became generalized to characterize the history of the Pacific War. As a result, war the clichés, regarding the allied forces crossing the Pacific Ocean could break away from the past methods embedded in a person - centered view of history and entered into a new historigraphical landscape."

Association between Variations in Body Mass Index and Cognitive Function in Older Korean Adults,2021,"['Body weight change', 'Body mass index', 'Cognitive dysfunction', 'Dementia']",,"Background: Although several studies have assessed obesity and cognitive impairment, most of these studies focus on body mass index (BMI) and cognitive impairment. Therefore to better understand the importance of weight maintenance with aging, this study investigated the relationship between variations in weight and cognitive impairment using the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) in individuals aged 45 years or older in Korea.Methods: Data on 3,477 adults with normal cognitive function (K-MMSE ≥24) at baseline were acquired from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) 2006–2016. The association between weight variability and risk of cognitive impairment was assessed using multiple logistic regression models. We also assessed weight variability and change in cognitive function over the 6-year follow-up using multiple linear regression.Results: Overall, higher variations in BMI were associated with cognitive impairment. Patients in the quintile with the highest variation (Q5) in BMI (mean of BMI changes, 2.69) showed the greatest degree of cognitive impairments (adjusted odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08–2.14; P for trend=0.016). Furthermore, a higher frequency in the number of times (3 times) the patient’s body weight changed was associated with a lower cognitive function (adjusted odds ratio, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.67–7.03; P for trend<0.001).Conclusion: In this nationally representative study, weight variability was associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline during mid- and late-life stages."

The specimens were heated in a protective argon atmosphere at 433 K for 24 h,followed by water quenching at 298 K. Finally, the heat-treated samples were aged at 373 K for different time intervals (ta = 2,4, 8, 16 and 32 h), followed by water quenching at 298 K. The phases present in the current alloys were detected by X-raydiffraction analysis. For morphological characterization, a scanning electron microscope operated at 20 kV was tilized. Themechanical properties of the samples were studied using hardness measurements. The variations in the hardness data withincreasing aging time were determined based on the structural transformations that take place in the alloys. The ANN modelwas applied to the hardness measurements to simulate and predict the Vickers hardness of Sn-Zn-Cu alloys with mean squareerror values equal 9.55E-06 and 9.44E-06 for training and validation data respectively after 281 epochs.

However, the traditional collaborative filtering technique has raised the question of having difficulty calculating the similarity for new customers or products due to the method of calculating similaritiesbased on direct connections and common features among customers. For this reason, a hybrid technique was designed to use content-based filtering techniques together. On the one hand, efforts have been made to solve these problems by applying the structural characteristics of social networks. This applies a method of indirectly calculating similarities through their similar customers placed between them. This means creating a customer’s network based on purchasing data and calculating the similarity between the two based on the features of the network that indirectly connects the two customers within this network. Such similarity can be used as a measure to predict whether the target customer accepts recommendations. The centrality metrics of networks can be utilized for the calculation of these similarities. Different centrality metrics have important implications in that they may have different effects on recommended performance. In this study, furthermore, the effect of these centrality metrics on the performance of recommendation may vary depending on recommender algorithms. In addition, recommendation techniques using network analysis can be expected to contribute to increasing recommendation performance even if they apply not only to new customers or products but also to entire customers or products. By considering a customer’s purchase of an item as a link generated between the customer and the item on the network, the prediction of user acceptance of recommendation is solved as a prediction of whether a new link will be created between them. As the classification models fit the purpose of solving the binary problem of whether the link is engaged or not, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine (SVM) are selected in the research. The data for performance evaluation used order data collected from an online shopping mall over four years and two months. Among them, the previous three years and eight months constitute social networks composed of and the experiment was conducted by organizing the data collected into the social network. The next four months’ records were used to train and evaluate recommender models. Experiments with the centrality metrics applied to each model show that the recommendation acceptance rates of the centrality metrics are different for each algorithm at a meaningful level. In this work, we analyzed only four commonly used centrality metrics: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. Eigenvector centrality records the lowest performance in all models except support vector machines. Closeness centrality and betweenness centrality show similar performance across all models. Degree centrality ranking moderate across overall models while betweenness centrality always ranking higher than degree centrality. Finally, closeness centrality is characterized by distinct differences in performance according to the model. It ranks first in logistic regression, artificial neural network, and decision tree withnumerically high performance. However, it only records very low rankings in support vector machine and K-neighborhood with low-performance levels. As the experiment results reveal, in a classification model, network centrality metrics over a subnetwork that connects the two nodes can effectively predict the connectivity between two nodes in a social network. Furthermore, each metric has a different performance depending on the classification model type. This result implie"

Although Dietary lifestyle includes attitudes and behaviors to meet their most basic needs, but few studies have examined the pattern of changes in dietary lifestyle driven by COVID-19. This study explores changes in dietary attitudes and behaviors among Korean consumers after COVID-19.SUBJECTS/METHODS: An online survey was conducted with 549 Korean adults aged 20 and older to identify general demographics and changes in dietary attitudes and behaviors. Data were collected from Oct 12 to Oct 18, 2020. Frequency, percentage, and mean values were calculated and a K-means cluster analysis was performed to categorize consumers based on the 5S of dietary attitudes (i.e., savor-oriented, safety-oriented, sustainability-oriented, saving-oriented, and socializing-oriented).RESULTS: Findings indicate consumers considered safety, health, and freshness to be most important when choosing groceries and prepared meal such as home meal replacement and delivery food. Among the types of services, a large proportion of consumers increased their delivery and take-out services. Regarding retail channels, the increase in the use of online retailers was remarkable compared to offline retailers. Finally, consumers were classified into four segments based on changes in dietary attitudes: “most influenced,” “seeking safety and sustainability,” “abstaining from savor and socializing,” and “least influenced.” Each type of consumer exhibited statistically significant differences by sex, age, household composition, presence of disease, and perceived risk of COVID-19.CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study provides initial insights for future research by identifying various aspects of dietary attitudes and behaviors among Korean consumers after COVID-19."

To check the adequacy of these clusters, we compare the time series similarity of PM10 data within each cluster using Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) and the Longest Common SubSequence(LCSS) among time series similarity measures. Furthermore, we verify that the time series similarity increases when the clusters are spatially more finely divided using the k-means algorithm."

The reason for using these data is that the descriptive lecture evaluation contains various students opinions, so useful information can be derived for future class improvement plans. The existing method for deriving useful information using lecture evaluation text data was only to perform simple aggregation by classifying the contents into several related categories. Unlike existing methods, this study intends to derive useful information by using text mining among data mining techniques. To this end, first, the machine learning method was applied to predictively classify whether the lecture evaluation text material was positive or negative. Second, for specific analysis, k-means cluster analysis, topic analysis, sentiment analysis, and naive Bayes method were applied. The unsupervised learning technique used the entire dataset, and the naive Bayes method, a supervised learning technique, used a validation data set (70%) to find the optimal model, and tested the optimal model with the validation data set (30%) and analyzed. As a result of the analysis, the naive Bayes method showed a correct classification rate of 84%, showing superior performance compared to the topic analysis (68%) and sentiment analysis (75%) methods, and was confirmed as the most appropriate model among the methods considered."
Method for Estimating Intramuscular Fat Percentage of Hanwoo(Korean Traditional Cattle) Using Convolutional Neural Networks in Ultrasound Images,2021,"['Hanwoo', 'Ultrasound Images', 'CNN', '%IMF(Intramuscular Fat Percentage)', 'ROI']",,"In order to preserve the seeds of excellent Hanwoo(Korean traditional cattle) and secure quality competitiveness in the infinite competition with foreign imported beef, production of high-quality Hanwoo beef is absolutely necessary. %IMF (Intramuscular Fat Percentage) is one of the most important factors in evaluating the value of high-quality meat, although standards vary according to food culture and industrial conditions by country. Therefore, it is required to develop a %IMF estimation algorithm suitable for Hanwoo. In this study, we proposed a method of estimating %IMF of Hanwoo using CNN in ultrasound images. First, the proposed method classified the chemically measured %IMF into 10 classes using k-means clustering method to apply CNN. Next, ROI images were obtained at regular intervals from each ultrasound image and used for CNN training and estimation. The proposed CNN model is composed of three stages of convolution layer and fully connected layer. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the %IMF of Hanwoo was estimated with an accuracy of 98.2%. The correlation coefficient between the estimated %IMF and the real %IMF by the proposed method is 0.97, which is about 10% better than the 0.88 of the previous method."

The Effects of Thai Consumers Attitudes of Korean-Wave on the Visit Intentions of Korean Restaurants-Focusing on the Mediation Effects of Perceived Consumption Value of Restaurant*,2021,"['Consumption Value', 'Functional Value', 'Korean-Wave Attitude', 'Symbolic Value', 'Visit Intention']",,"Purpose - This study is an empirical study on the relationship of Thai consumers’ attitude toward Korean Wave with the visit intention of Korean restaurants and a mediation effect of consumption value of Korean restaurants. Design/Methodology/Approach - Data were collected using a structured questionnaire of 245 Thai consumers and the hypotheses presented were verified by regression analysis and structural equation models. Findings - As a result of the empirical analysis, it was found that the higher the attractiveness and favorableness of Thai consumers for K-Wave, the higher the intention to visit Korean restaurants, and the Korean Wave attitude have a positive effect on the functional and symbolic values of Korean restaurants. In particular, the important result that can be presented in this study is that the better the attitude toward K-Wave, the higher the consumption value (functional/symbolic value) of Korean restaurants and the symbolic value plays a significant mediating effect on the relationship of the attitude of K-Wave and visiting intention, while the effect of functional value is not verified. Research Implication or Originality - These results means that in order to lead Thai consumers to a Korean restaurant using K-Wave, a strategy to make Thai ones perceive symbolic value of a Korean restaurant higher would be more effective. The main strategic implication of this study is that a high-end positioning strategy with a high symbolism, which make Korean restaurant as a suitable place as a means to show off one’s value (or self) or as a means to show off one’s social status (or role) to Thai consumers, will be relatively effective."
Segmenting urban festival visitors’ employing expectation : Comparing between planned and unplanned festivalgoers,2021,"['Market segmentation', 'Unplanned visit', 'Urban festival', 'Expectation', 'Festivalgoer']",,"Though planned visitors have historically been shown to be attracted to urban public festivals due to their proximity to the area and to the attractions, unplanned visitors have not been investigated in the festival context. This paper attempted market segmentation based on two classifications of previous planning: before visit and expectation of festival experiences. Survey respondents were divided into two groups of unplanned and planned festivalgoers, and factor analysis was employed to identify festivalgoers’ expectation factors of the festival experience. Utilizing a K-means cluster analysis, a total of six segments were obtained. Each group showed a different combination of festival expectation styles. ANOVA results presented distinct demographics between the festivalgoer cluster groups and confirmed different levels of festivalgoers’ satisfaction and inclination to recommend. The results suggest that festival organizers should comprehend the characteristics of their target market and implement appropriate marketing strategies to enhance festivalgoers’ satisfaction and to improve their likelihood to recommend such events."

The geology of this deposit consists of Archean granulite, Paleoproterozoinc migmatitic granite, Paleo-Mesoproterozoic sodic granite, Paleoproterozoic Liaohe group, Mesozoic diorite and monzoritic granite. The Zhenzigou deposit which is a strata bound SEDEX or SEDEX type deposit occurs as layer ore and vein ore in Langzishan formation and Dashiqiao formation of the Paleoproterozoic Liaohe group. Based on mineral petrography and paragenesis, dolomites from this deposit are classified three type (1. dolomite (D<sub>0</sub>) as hostrock, 2. dolomite (D<sub>1</sub>) in layer ore associated with white mica, quartz, K-feldspar, sphalerite, galena, pyrite, arsenopyrite from greenschist facies, 3. dolomite (D<sub>2</sub>) in vein ore associated with quartz, apatite and pyrite from quartz vein).

It means that dolomites from the Zhenzigou deposit have higher content of trace elements compared to the theoretical composition of dolomite. Feo and MnO contents of these dolomites (D<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>) contain 0.05-2.06 wt.%, 0.00-0.08 wt.% (D<sub>0</sub>), 3.53-17.22 wt.%, 0.49-3.71 wt.% (D<sub>1</sub>) and 2.32-3.91 wt.%, 0.43-0.95 wt.% (D<sub>2</sub>), respectively. The dolomite (D<sub>1</sub>) from layer ore has higher content of these trace elements (FeO, MnO, ZnO and PbO) than dolomite (D<sub>0</sub>) from hostrock and dolomite (D<sub>2</sub>) from quartz vein. Dolomites correspond to Ferroan dolomite (D<sub>0</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>), and ankerite and Ferroan dolomite (D<sub>1</sub>), respectively. Therefore, 1) dolomite (D<sub>0</sub>) from hostrock is a Ferroan dolomite formed by marine evaporative lagoon environment in Paleoproterozoic Jiao Liao Ji basin. 2) Dolomite (D<sub>1</sub>) from layer ore is a ankerite and Ferroan dolomite formed by hydrothermal metasomatism origined metamorphism (greenschist facies) associated with Paleoproterozoic intrusion. 3) Dolomte (D<sub>2</sub>) from quartz vein is a Ferroan dolomite formed by hydrothermal fluid origined Mesozoic intrusion."
EDGE: An Enticing Deceptive-content GEnerator as Defensive Deception,2021,"['Cyber deception defense', 'Decoy file', 'Fake text', 'Honeyfile', 'Honeypot']",,"Cyber deception defense mitigates Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) with deploying deceptive entities, such as the Honeyfile. The Honeyfile distracts attackers from valuable digital documents and attracts unauthorized access by deliberately exposing fake content. The effectiveness of distraction and trap lies in the enticement of fake content. However, existing studies on the Honeyfile focus less on this perspective. In this work, we seek to improve the enticement of fake text content through enhancing its readability, indistinguishability, and believability. Hence, an enticing deceptive-content generator, EDGE, is presented. The EDGE is constructed with three steps: extracting key concepts with a semantics-aware K-means clustering algorithm, searching for candidate deceptive concepts within the Word2Vec model, and generating deceptive text content under the Integrated Readability Index (IR). Furthermore, the readability and believability performance analyses are undertaken. The experimental results show that EDGE generates indistinguishable deceptive text content without decreasing readability. In all, EDGE proves effective to generate enticing deceptive text content as deception defense against APTs."

Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Cluster-based Undersampling and Boosted C5.0 Algorithm,2021,"['Breast cancer diagnosis', 'cluste analysis', 'imbalanced data classification', 'sample selection', 'undersampling.']",,"Learning from imbalanced data set is relatively new challenge for breast cancer diagnosis, where the diseases cases are often quite rare relative to normal population. Although traditional algorithms are all accuracyoriented which result biased towards the majority class. The combinations of sampling methods with ensemble classifiers have shown certainly good performance. In this paper, a hybrid of cluster-based undersampling and boosted C5.0 is proposed. The proposed classification model consists of two phases: cluster analysis and classification. In cluster analysis, affinity propagation algorithm is used to define the number of clusters, and then the k-means clustering is utilized to select the border and informative samples. In the classification phase, C5.0 algorithm is used in conjunction with boosting technical, owing to leverage the strength of the individual classifiers. The proposed algorithm is assessed by 14 benchmark imbalanced data sets taken from UCI dataset repository. The extensive experimental results on different imbalanced datasets demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can achieve better classification performance in terms of Matthews’ Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as compared to other existing imbalanced dataset classification algorithms."

Quantitative Assessment of Chest CT Patterns in COVID-19 and Bacterial Pneumonia Patients: a Deep Learning Perspective,2021,"['COVID-19', 'Pneumonia', 'Bacterial', 'Computed Tomography', 'Deep Learning', 'Cluster Analysis']",,"Background: It is difficult to distinguish subtle differences shown in computed tomography (CT) images of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and bacterial pneumonia patients, which often leads to an inaccurate diagnosis. It is desirable to design and evaluate interpretable feature extraction techniques to describe the patient's condition.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 170 confirmed patients with COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia acquired at Yeungnam University Hospital in Daegu, Korea. The lung and lesion regions were segmented to crop the lesion into 2D patches to train a classifier model that could differentiate between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The K-means algorithm was used to cluster deep features extracted by the trained model into 20 groups.Each lesion patch cluster was described by a characteristic imaging term for comparison.For each CT image containing multiple lesions, a histogram of lesion types was constructed using the cluster information. Finally, a Support Vector Machine classifier was trained with the histogram and radiomics features to distinguish diseases and severity.Results: The 20 clusters constructed from 170 patients were reviewed based on common radiographic appearance types. Two clusters showed typical findings of COVID-19, with two other clusters showing typical findings related to bacterial pneumonia. Notably, there is one cluster that showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the central and peripheral lungs and was considered to be a key factor for severity classification. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 91.2% for classifying COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia patients with 95% reported for severity classification. The CT quantitative parameters represented by the values of cluster 8 were correlated with existing laboratory data and clinical parameters.Conclusion: Deep chest CT analysis with constructed lesion clusters revealed well-known COVID-19 CT manifestations comparable to manual CT analysis. The constructed histogram features improved accuracy for both diseases and severity classification, and showed correlations with laboratory data and clinical parameters. The constructed histogram features can provide guidance for improved analysis and treatment of COVID-19."

Through this, the purpose of this study is to improve understanding of the characteristics of elderly consumers and to derive customized educational and practical recommendations for each type of elderly consumers. Elderly consumers over 60 who can access the Internet were selected as a sample, and data of 311 elderly consumers were collected through an online survey using a structured questionnaire. The data were analyzed through descriptive analysis, K-means cluster analysis, multinomial logistic regression analysis, and ANOVA using the SPSS 26.0 program.The main results of the study are as follows. As a result of cluster analysis based on the amount and diversity of digital service use, four types of elderly consumers were derived: enthusiastic use group (29.9%), relationship-oriented use group (27.3%), function-oriented use group (25.1%), limited use group (17.7%). The influence of the preceding variables such as self-efficacy of information, willingness to use information, and demographic characteristics on the types of elderly consumers was identified. In addition, significant differences in life satisfaction, digital consumption environment maturity, technology stress, and information technology alienation, which are the outcome variables for each elderly consumer type, were analyzed.Enthusiastic use group tends to be an early adopter who actively searches and uses information through digital services, so the development of specialized services for the elderly that reflects their opinions is required. Function-oriented use group is a relatively young senior with high information efficacy, and should promote the use of emotional and relationship-oriented digital services to increase their satisfaction in life. For the relationship-oriented use group, it is necessary to strengthen information capabilities so that they can actively use digital services to process practical tasks and increase the convenience of life. Limited use group is a group with low income and education level and high age, and is the group that should focus most in terms of consumer policy and education. The limited use group is the group with low income and education level, high age, and the lowest information efficacy and willingness to use. In addition, it is characterized by low life satisfaction and feeling alienated from information technology. Therefore, it is necessary to focus consumer policy and education on this group to raise positive awareness of technology and provide education to enhance practical digital service utilization ability.This study is meaningful in that it categorizes the elderly according to the use of digital services and presents their characteristics and customized strategies, rather than simply viewing the elderly as information vulnerable groups."

In this study, we investigate the effects of the sEMG-signal sampling rate and feature extraction window length on the classification accuracy in hand-motion recognition. Ten normal subjects and one forearm amputee were made to wear an armband module consisting of eight EMG sensors, and seven and four hand movements of the normal subjects and amputee, respectively, were measured. The EMG signal was measured at 500 Hz and down-sampled to 250, 100, and 50 Hz. Four time-domain features (mean average value, waveform length, zero crossing, and slope sign change) were calculated as the sEMG features with six selected window lengths, which were increased in 50 ms intervals (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 ms). Hand-motion recognition was performed using artificial neural network, support vector machine, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Our results showed that for all classifiers and all subjects, the hand-motion classification accuracy increases with an increase in the sampling rate and window length. We believe that our findings will aid in selecting the appropriate sampling rate and window length for prosthetics meant for daily use."

Cervical Lordosis Ratio as a Novel Predictor for the Loss of Cervical Lordosis After Laminoplasty,2021,"['Cervical lordosis ratio', 'T1 slope', 'Cervical spondylotic myelopathy', 'Ossification posterior longitudinal ligament', 'Laminoplasty', 'Loss of cervical lordosis']",,"Objective: Maintaining cervical lordosis (CL) after laminoplasty is important for indirect decompression of the spinal cord. This study aimed to identify preoperative dynamic radiographic predictors for the loss of CL after laminoplasty.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 141 consecutive patients who underwent cervical laminoplasty for cervical myelopathy. The following radiographic parameters were measured before surgery and at 1 year of follow-up: CL, C7 slope, C2–7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), C2–7 range of motion (ROM), CL in flexion, CL in extension, ROM of flexion (Flex ROM), and ROM of extension. The CL ratio (CLR) was defined as 100×Flex ROM/C2–7 ROM. ΔCL was defined as postoperative CL minus preoperative CL. Patients were classified into 2 groups: group K (kyphotic change group, ΔCL ≤-10) and group C (control group, ΔCL >-10).Results: The patient population comprised 94 men and 47 women (mean age, 70.9±9.4 years), with 24 patients (17.0%) classified into group K. CL, C7 slope, and CLR were significantly higher in group K than in group C. The groups did not significantly differ in age, sex, C2–7 SVA, and C2–7 ROM. On multivariable analysis, the CLR was significantly associated with postoperative kyphotic changes. On receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve=0.717, p<0.001), the cutoff value for CLR was 68.9%, with sensitivity and specificity of 87.5% and 57.3%, respectively.Conclusion: The CLR, reflecting the balance between flexion and extension mobility, was identified as a novel predictor for CL loss after laminoplasty, with a cutoff value of 68.9%."
Different Seasonal Variations of Potassium in Hemodialysis Patients with High Longitudinal Potassium Levels: A Multicenter Cohort Study Using DialysisNet,2021,"['End-stage renal disease', 'hemodialysis', 'potassium', 'seasonal variation']",,"Purpose: To determine seasonal variations in serum potassium levels among hemodialysis patients.Materials and Methods: This was a multicenter cohort study of patients whounderwent hemodialysis and were registered in DialysisNetat our four associated general hospitals between January and December 2016. Month-to-month potassium variabilitywas quantified as SD/√{n/(n-1)}, and a non-hierarchical method was used to cluster groups according to potassium trajectories.Seasonal variations in potassium levels were analyzed using a cosinor analysis.Results: The analysis was performed on 279 patients with a mean potassium level of 5.08±0.58 mmol/L. After clustering, 52.3%(n=146) of patients were included in the moderate group (K+, 4.6±0.4 mmol/L) and 47.7% (n=133) in the high group (K+, 5.6±0.4mmol/L). The mean potassium level peaked in January in the moderate group (4.83±0.74 mmol/L) and in August in the highgroup (5.51±0.70 mmol/L). In the high potassium group, potassium levels were significantly higher in summer than in autumn(p<0.001) and spring (p=0.007). Month-to-month potassium variability was greater in the high group than in the moderategroup (0.59±0.19 mmol/L vs. 0.52±0.21 mmol/L, respectively, p=0.012). Compared to patients in the first quartile of potassiumvariability (≤0.395 mmol/L), those with higher variability (2nd–4th quartiles) were 2.8–4.2 fold more likely to be in the high potassiumgroup.Conclusion: Different seasonal patterns of serum potassium were identified in the moderate and high potassium groups, withpotassium levels being significantly higher in the summer season in the high potassium group and in winter for the moderate potassiumgroup."
자초위난에 대한 피난행위로 인한 법익침해의 가벌성 판단,2021,"['긴급피난', '자초위난', '위법한 선행행위', '이익형량', '책임귀속', '정당화', '면책', 'Necessity(Choice of Evil', 'Lesser Evil Defense)', 'Culpably Caused Situation of Choice of Evil', 'Unlawful Preceding Act', 'Interest Balancing', 'Ascription of Responsibility', 'Justification', 'Excuse']",,"When we consider a culpably caused situation of choice of evil, basically two frames of views can be relied on. First, to determine whether a necessity defense can stand for the intentional act of evasion from a danger caused by a fault of defendant, a preceding act can be taken into consideration. Second, the other perspective is about determining whether a resulting consequence shall be ascribed to a preceding act regardless of an intervening factor of necessity defense.The approach that a culpability of a preceding act can be caught based on the elements of intention and negligence seem to be facially evident but may bring another problem from a different direction. In fact, Küper’s ‘actio illicita in causa’ look attractive in a sense, because it try to capture clear elemental forms of a preceding act. Nonetheless, Küper’s view has some distance from the approach of considering a contribution of a preceding act to determine whether a necessity defense stand or not. Based on Küper, the main questions are how far a substance of an intention is objectively realized and what is a consequence that can be ascribed to a danger caused by a neglient act of an defendant. An act of necessity as an intervening factor should be taken into consideration based on basic legal standards of causation and objective ascription of responsibility.The issue of whether a necessity defense is persuasive in the case of a culpably caused situation of choice of evil by a defendant should be resolved by reconstruction of the requirement of ‘reasonable cause’ in Korean Criminal Code Article 22. It must be a very difficult task to reasonably reconstruct the requirements of interest balancing, complementation, appropriateness and the principle of minimum ham. Especially, the requirements of complementation, appropriateness and minimum ham seem hardly reinterpreted even though there was a culpable preceding act. Nonetheless, we can widen the required gap between a protected interest and a inflicted interest just like in case of defensive necessity defense. If the standard of interest-balancing seems too rigid, we can rely on the standard of reasonableness. It means that we should consider a totality of circumstances of a case to cope with pressures from various forms and substances of culpability. But, the standard of reasonable ought to be used in a complementary way."

Combating disaster prone zone by prioritizing attributes with hybrid clustering and ANP approach,2021,"['Disaster management', 'Clustering', 'Tropical storms', 'Vulnerability', 'Data mining']",,"Due to a lack of assets and high improbability, developing an information system for every disaster situation is a challenging task. Consequently, building an information system for such a situation is essential, and the latest research direction has emphasized on development of such a system which varies due to the irregular nature of environments. This work emphasizes the data mining technique based on available disaster data or the earlier prediction of such occurrences to combat damages. The data mining technique is applied to the clustering of data for smooth processes of the obtained data. K-means clustering and analytic network process (ANP) are implemented as unsupervised learning for initial data and to find groups in the data, clustered based on feature similarity.The proposed approach implies an effective tool for predicting impacts in terms of hazards and this paper also evaluates its effectiveness. This study offers important insights into the disaster recovery practitioner to select the best disaster recovery solution and prioritize them for their enterprise."
Use of Monte Carlo code MCS for multigroup cross section generation for fast reactor analysis,2021,"['Monte Carlo', 'Nodal diffusion', 'Multigroup', 'Cross section generation', 'SFR', 'MCS']",,"Multigroup cross section (MG XS) generation by the UNIST in-house Monte Carlo (MC) code MCS for fast reactor analysis using nodal diffusion codes is reported. The feasibility of the approach is quantified for two sodium fast reactors (SFRs) specified in the OECD/NEA SFR benchmark: a 1000 MW<sub>th</sub> metal-fueled SFR (MET-1000) and a 3600 MW<sub>th</sub> oxide-fueled SFR (MOX-3600). The accuracy of a few-group XSs generated by MCS is verified using another MC code, Serpent 2. The neutronic steady-state whole-core problem is analyzed using MCS/RAST-K with a 24-group XS set. Various core parameters of interest (core k<sub>eff</sub>, power profiles, and reactivity feedback coefficients) are obtained using both MCS/RAST-K and MCS. A code-to-code comparison indicates excellent agreement between the nodal diffusion solution and stochastic solution; the error in the core k<sub>eff</sub> is less than 110 pcm, the root-mean-square error of the power profiles is within 1.0%, and the error of the reactivity feedback coefficients is within three standard deviations. Furthermore, using the super-homogenization-corrected XSs improves the prediction accuracy of the control rod worth and power profiles with all rods in. Therefore, the results demonstrate that employing the MCS MG XSs for the nodal diffusion code is feasible for high-fidelity analyses of fast reactors."

To reduce this damage, wind-tolerant rice breeding programshave been conducted at the Yeongdeok substation (YS) of the National Institute of Crop Science (NICS). This study was conducted to examinethe effects of these wind-tolerant rice breeding programs. Under the wind-tolerance screening facility (WTSF), the wind-tolerance of 17 ricevarieties bred at NICS (usual rice) and 20 rice varieties bred at YS (wind-tolerant rice) were analyzed by evaluating six traits: white spikelet(WS), white panicle (WP), degree of wind damage (DG), ratio of ripened grain (RRG) at control (RRG_C) and treatment (RRG_T), andreduction rate of RRG between control and treatment (RRG_R). Wind-tolerant rice showed more wind-tolerant characteristics than usual rice,such as lower WS, WP, DG, and RRG_R and higher RRG_T and RRG_C. In the principal component analysis, wind-tolerant rice showinga similar direction for RRG_T and RRG_C were located separately from the usual rice. The adaptability tests of wind-tolerant rice wereconducted by evaluating eight yield-related traits in the wind-prone areas. Wind-tolerant rice was divided into three clusters by K-means clusteringanalysis using WP and RRG_T with the WTSF, RRG, and yield in the wind-prone areas. Among the three clusters, YC2 had the strongestwind tolerance performance, followed by YC3 showing moderate wind tolerance, and YC1 the weakest wind tolerance. ‘Sinbo’, a varietybelonging to YC2, exhibited the strongest wind tolerance and high yield potential among all varieties. The wind-tolerant rice varieties bredat YS could be used practically to prevent wind damage and utilize breeding materials to enhance the wind tolerance of rice varieties."
Anatomic reconstruction for acromioclavicular joint injuries: a pilot study of a cost-effective new technique,2021,"['Acromioclavicular joint', 'Coracoclavicular reconstruction', 'Open technique', 'Anatomical reconstruction', 'Shoulder']",,"Background: The treatment for acromioclavicular joint injuries (ACJI) ranges from a conservative approach to extensive surgical reconstruction, and the decision on how to manage these injuries depends on the grade of acromioclavicular (AC) joint separation, resources, and skill availability. After a thorough review of the literature, the researchers adopted a simple cost-effective technique of AC joint reconstruction for acute ACJI requiring surgery.Methods: This was a prospective single-center study conducted between April 2017 and April 2018. For patients with acute ACJI more than Rockwood grade 3, the researchers performed open coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction using synthetic sutures along with an Endobutton and a figure of 8 button plate. This was followed by AC ligament repair augmenting it with temporary percutaneous AC K-wires. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Constant Murley shoulder score.Results: Seventeen patients underwent surgery. The immediate postoperative radiograph showed an anatomical reduction of the AC joint dislocation in all patients. During follow-up, one patient developed subluxation but was asymptomatic. The mean follow-up period was 30 months (range, 24–35 months). The mean Constant score at 24 months was 95. No AC joint degeneration was noted in follow-up X-rays. The follow-up X-rays showed significant infra-clavicular calcification in 11 of the 17 patients, which was an evidence of a healed coracoclavicular ligament post-surgery.Conclusions: This study presents a simple cost-effective technique with a short learning curve for anatomic reconstruction of acute ACJI. The preliminary results have been very encouraging."

In order to completethe required liberal arts Korean language courses at University A in Seoul in the first and secondsemesters of 2019, a mixed class case was examined focusing on four minority foreign studentstaking classes with Korean students. It is a reality that not only foreign students, but also professors,who have to take the required liberal arts courses in the same way as Korean students withoutconsidering individual Korean proficiency, face difficulties and complaints about this class.Therefore, in terms of understanding Korean language and social culture using media such asTV dramas, movies, and K-pop, we tried to prepare an educational plan through examples ofreading, writing, and speaking. In this way, it was found that, in the liberal arts class, the uniquemethod of constructing the meaning of media, from movies and dramas to entertainment programsand various YouTube videos, was helpful for practical understanding of Korean and adaptationto Korean social culture.The expected effects of this study will be effective in improving Korean language skills andacademic ability of foreign students, promoting understanding of Korean society and culture, andhelping foreign students understand university life."
Bragg-curve simulation of carbon-ion beams for particle-therapy applications: A study with the GEANT4 toolkit,2021,"['Hadrontherapy', 'Monte Carlo simulation', 'Geant4', 'Fragmentation']",,"We used the GEANT4 Monte Carlo MC Toolkit to simulate carbon ion beams incident on water, tissue, and bone, taking into account nuclear fragmentation reactions. Upon increasing the energy of the primary beam, the position of the Bragg-Peak transfers to a location deeper inside the phantom. For different materials, the peak is located at a shallower depth along the beam direction and becomes sharper with increasing electron density NZ. Subsequently, the generated depth dose of the Bragg curve is then benchmarked with experimental data from GSI in Germany. The results exhibit a reasonable correlation with GSI experimental data with an accuracy of between 0.02 and 0.08 cm, thus establishing the basis to adopt MC in heavy-ion treatment planning. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov K-S test further ascertained from a statistical point of view that the simulation data matched the experimentally measured data very well. The two-dimensional isodose contours at the entrance were compared to those around the peak position and in the tail region beyond the peak, showing that bone produces more dose, in comparison to both water and tissue, due to secondary doses. In the water, the results show that the maximum energy deposited per fragment is mainly attributed to secondary carbon ions, followed by secondary boron and beryllium. Furthermore, the number of protons produced is the highest, thus making the maximum contribution to the total dose deposition in the tail region. Finally, the associated spectra of neutrons and photons were analyzed. The mean neutron energy value was found to be 16.29 MeV, and 1.03 MeV for the secondary gamma. However, the neutron dose was found to be negligible as compared to the total dose due to their longer range."

Increased suspended sediment concentration (SSC) has various effects on water supply systems such as increased treatment cost and consequently, there have been various efforts to develop a model for predicting SSC. However, SSC is affected by both the natural and anthropogenic environment, making it challenging to predict SSC. Recently, advanced machine learning models have increasingly been used for water quality prediction. This study developed an ensemble machine learning model to predict SSC using the XGBoost (XGB) algorithm. The observed discharge (Q) and SSC in two fields monitoring stations were used to develop the model. The input variables were clustered in two groups with low and high ranges of Q using the k-means clustering algorithm. Then each group of data was separately used to optimize XGB (Model 1). The model performance was compared with that of the XGB model using the entire data (Model 2). The models were evaluated by mean squared error-observation standard deviation ratio (RSR) and root mean squared error. The RSR were 0.51 and 0.57 in the two monitoring stations for Model 2, respectively, while the model performance improved to RSR 0.46 and 0.55, respectively, for Model 1."

A total of 57 students of a university in south Korea participated in this study. A score of above 24 and a score of under 17 for FSCRS were assigned each a high self-criticism (HG) group and a low self-criticism (LG) group, respectively. These students participated in an experiment of task-switching using task paradigm (TS), to measure cognitive flexibility. The TS presented that, the greater the switch-cost people got, the less the cognitive flexibility they had. Results of the study showed that the HG group had better task performance than the LG, although differences in switch-cost between the two groups were not significant. In the valence, the switch-cost for negative words was significantly higher than that of LG. This means that cognitive flexibility can be reduced when groups with high self-criticism are exposed to negative stimuli. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed."

Thus, it is necessary to understand the consumer s consumption behavior of local food in a retail environment where shopping channels are diversified, and to examine the factors affecting satisfaction level to establish a sustainable local food consumption system. Therefore, this study categorizes consumers according to the level of use of the shopping channel by reflecting the recent changes in consumers  purchasing behavior of local food through diversified channels. Based on this, it is examined the differences in the characteristics and satisfaction of each consumer types, and what factors affect the level of shopping channel use. An online panel survey was conducted on 767 consumers across the country who responded to directly purchasing local food, and frequency analysis, factor analysis, K-mean cluster analysis, chi-square test, one-way variance analysis, and multinomial logistics regression analysis were performed. As a result of the study, the types of consumers were found into four groups: ‘multi-channel user group’, ‘eco-friendly channel user group’, ‘traditional channel user group’, and ‘large retail channel user group’. It was confirmed that not only demographic characteristics such as the age, average monthly household income, and education level, but also level of local food consumption, perception of important information and satisfaction with shopping channel were different for each type. In addition, factors affecting the level of use of shopping channels differed by consumer type. Through these results, in order to promote the consumption of local food in the long term, it is expected that it will be able to provide basic data necessary to understand that consumers have differentiated characteristics according to the shopping channels they use."

AI의 출현과 진화를 하나의 사회 현상으로 보고, 시민이 추구하는 목표와 궤적을 함께 하는지에 대한 비판적 수용 교육을 견지할 필요가 있다. 이를 위해 AI에 대한 다양한 사회적 이슈를 사회과 교실수업에 도입하여 학습자가 인간의 본질적 가치에 기반하여 고민하고 논의할 수 있는 반성적 학습경험의 제공이 필요하다. 둘째, AI를 인간을 위해 함께하는 도구로 받아들여야 한다. 이를 위해 AI에 대한 이해와 활용 교육이 필요하다. 사회과 의사결정학습이나 개념학습 등에 의사결정 알고리즘 트리, K-평균 군집 알고리즘 등의 다양한 알고리즘 활용 교육을 언플러그드(unplugged) 방식으로 도전할 필요가 있다. 나아가 AI플랫폼을 활용한 다양한 교수학습 설계를 시도하여 사회과 교수-학습의 지평을 확장 시킬 필요가 있다. 인공지능을 사람의 생각처럼 구현한다면, 즉 자의식과 자유의지를 지닌 종의 탄생은 미증유의 문제를 발생시키고, 인간의 지속 가능성을 위협할 수 있다. 사회과교육은 이러한 문제 인식을 토대로 21세기 미래 시민 사회를 대비하여 인간의 본질적 가치에 기반하여 반성적으로 사고하는 성찰적 시민성에 주목해야 할 것이다.","This study infers what kind of difference between AI and human ‘thinking’ based on previous research data, and based on this, the purpose of this study is to set the perspective of social studies education on AI. First, if we compare the thinking of humans and AI, first, AI does not have free will based on self-consciousness. The subject of decision making is the self, but AI without self-consciousness cannot be regarded as the subject of decision making. Second, AI has no mind. A key factor influencing the decision-making process is the preference and satisfaction of the decision-making entity, and it can be inferred that AI without a mind cannot have decision-making drivers such as preference and satisfaction. Based on these discussions, the perspective of social studies education on AI is presented as follows. First, it should aim for a controllable AI. It is necessary to view the emergence and evolution of AI as a social phenomenon, and to maintain critical acceptance education on whether the goal and the trajectory pursued by citizens are the same. To this end, it is necessary to introduce various social issues related to AI into social studies classroom classes to provide a reflective learning experience where learners can ponder and discuss based on the intrinsic value of human beings. Second, AI should be accepted as a co-existence for humans. For this, it is necessary to understand and use AI training. It is necessary to challenge the education using various algorithms such as decision-making algorithm tree and K-means cluster algorithm in an unplugged way for social studies decision-making learning or concept learning. Furthermore, it is necessary to expand the horizon of social studies teaching-learning by attempting various teaching and learning designs using AI platforms."

"Central Sarcopenia, Frailty and Comorbidity as Predictor of Surgical Outcome in Elderly Patients with Degenerative Spine Disease",2021,"['Frailty', 'Sarcopenia', 'Comorbidity', 'Spine', 'Aged', 'Postoperative complications']",,"Objective : People are living longer and the elderly population continues to increase. The incidence of degenerative spinal diseases (DSDs) in the elderly population is quite high. Therefore, we are facing more cases of DSD and offering more surgical solutions in geriatric patients. Understanding the significance and association of frailty and central sarcopenia as risk factors for spinal surgery in elderly patients will be helpful in improving surgical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of prospectively collected data to assess the impact of preoperative central sarcopenia, frailty, and comorbidity on surgical outcome in elderly patients with DSD. Methods : We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent elective spinal surgery performed from January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 at our hospital. We included patients aged 65 and over who underwent surgery on the thoracic or lumbar spine and were diagnosed as DSD. Central sarcopenia was measured by the 50th percentile of psoas : L4 vertebral index (PLVI) using the cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle. We used the Korean version of the fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight (K-FRAIL) scale to measure frailty. Comorbidity was confirmed and scored using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). As a tool for measuring surgical outcome, we used the Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification for postoperative complications and the length of stay (LOS). Results : This study included 85 patients (35 males and 50 females). The mean age was 74.05±6.47 years. Using the K-FRAIL scale, four patients were scored as robust, 44 patients were pre-frail and 37 patients were frail. The mean PLVI was 0.61±0.19. According to the CD classification, 50 patients were classified as grade 1, 19 as grade 2, and four as grade 4. The mean LOS was 12.35±8.17 days. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed that postoperative complication was significantly associated with surgical invasiveness and K-FRAIL scale. LOS was significantly associated with surgical invasiveness and CCI. K-FRAIL scale showed a significant correlation with CCI and PLVI. Conclusion : The present study demonstrates that frailty, comorbidity, and surgical invasiveness are important risk factors for postoperative complications and LOS in elderly patients with DSD. Preoperative recognition of these factors may be useful for perioperative optimization, risk stratification, and patient counseling."

For the breadth of knowledge, we attempted to figure out the range of knowledge in terms of the content areas using the standards from the Korea Society Educational Studies in Mathematics[KSESM](2008). For the depth of knowledge, we chose Anderson & Krathwohl(2001) framework to analyze levels of each item in the test. The results from the analysis of 180 items in the teacher employment test between 2014 and 2021 show that while items in mathematics education have considerable variation in terms of range and levels of knowledge, those in some subjects of mathematics can be found only certain level of knowledge. i.e., merely certain topics or levels of knowledge have been heavily evaluated. Thus, considering the breadth and depth of knowledge teachers should have, the current exam needs to be improved in terms of teacher knowledge. It does not mean that every topic and every level of knowledge should be evaluated. However, it is a meaningful opportunity to think about what kinds of knowledge teachers should have in relation to K-12 mathematics curriculum and how we can evaluate the knowledge. More collaborative effort is inevitable for the improvement of teacher knowledge and teacher employment test."

This study pays attention to the fact that the pandemic moment may be a matter of public health policy on the one hand, but at the same time it is an opportunity for fundamental reconstruction of everyday experience of the people. Through cultural-political analysis, this study examine the possibility of long-term prospects for devising a new form of life. Therefore, this study focuses on the following three dimensions. First, the discourses of ‘new normal’ are not the problem of disruption, but that of an effort to consciously reproduce the historical path of the old ‘normal’. Second, the new normal itself is a dominant discourse, and it is necessary to recontextualize the myriad of professional, technical, and political languages that make it common sense within the public’s experience. And third, in the process of modularizing the code of conducts according to a new ‘technical solution’, we need to examine how our daily life is reconstructed and a new structure of experience is formed. In this process, this study examines that the dominant discourse of the new normal centered on digital technology is ultimately the final version of neoliberal technopia, and consists of the prospect of a new evolution of capitalism (‘Green New Deal’) that realizes it. This is a very important achievement in itself, especially in Korean society, where the successful response to COVID-19 called ‘K-Quarantine’ has been achieved, but in the process, we are reminded that a more delicate approach to the long-term social change path that is becoming more real is needed."

Methods: In this methodological study, the initial items were identified through a review of the literature and surveys from nursing staff regarding the nursing needs on comprehensive nursing care units. Content validity was evaluated by nine nursing staff members from comprehensive nursing care units. To evaluate the concurrent validity and derive a patient classification system, nursing needs scores, perceived nursing needs and perceived patient severity for 216 patient cases were evaluated by five nurses. These data were analyzed using Pearson‘s correlation coefficients, one-way ANOVA with Scheffé post hoc tests and K-means clustering. Results: After evaluating content validity, the developed scale contained 64 activities in two domains: nursing intervention and assistance of daily living. Concurrent validity was verified by analyzing the differences in the nursing needs scores according to each group of perceived nursing needs and severity (p<.001) and by analyzing the correlation between the score of the developed scale and the National Health Insurance Service nursing need assessment scale (r=.68, p<.001). Based on the score of the developed scale, a patient classification system that classified nursing needs into four stages was derived. Conclusion: The developed scale represented nursing activities in comprehensive nursing care units. It also provided specific data regarding the time spent on nursing activities. Therefore, it is expected to contribute toward establishing appropriate nurse staffing strategies to provide quality patient care."
Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology Earth System Model and Its Simulation Characteristics,2021,"['CMIP6', 'El Niño-Southern Oscillation', 'KIOST-ESM', 'Madden–Julian Oscillation', 'Physical parameterization', 'Southern Ocean warm bias']",,"We document the performance of a new earth system model developed at Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology, called the KIOST-ESM, based on a low-resolution (~ 200 km for the atmosphere, ~ 100 km for the ocean) version of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model 2.5. The main changes made to the base model include adopting a unified convection scheme for cumulus convection and an ocean mixed layer parameterization considering Langmuir circulation, which improve the model fidelity significantly. In addition, the KIOST-ESM adopts a new soil respiration scheme in the dynamic vegetation process of its land component. The performance of the KIOST-ESM was assessed in pre-industrial and historical simulations that are made as part of its participation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). The response of the earth system to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations was analyzed in the ScenarioMIP simulations. An abrupt quadrupling of CO2 experiment suggests that the equilibrium climate sensitivity of KIOST-ESM is 3.36 K—very close to the averaged one obtained from CMIP5 simulations. Although the KIOST-ESM showed a notable cold bias in the Northern Hemisphere and the double Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone bias, the KIOST-ESM outperforms the base model in simulating the mean sea surface temperature over the Southern Ocean and over the cold tongue in the tropical Pacific. The KIOST-ESM can also simulate the dominant tropical variability in intraseasonal (Madden–Julian Oscillation) and interannual (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) timescales more realistically."

Executive function (EF) is a higher level of cognitive function related to academic achievement. The present study aimed to evaluate the cognitive (including EF) and behavioral outcomes of Korean children born extremely preterm (EP) and to analyze any biological or socioeconomic risk factors for poor cognitive outcomes in this population.Methods: A total of 71 infants weighing < 1,000 g at birth or born before 30 weeks of gestation (EP group) who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit from 2008 to 2009 were included in this study and compared with 40 term-birth controls. The Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, Advanced Test of Attention (ATA), Stroop test, Children's Color Trails Test (CCTT), and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were used.Additionally, the Korean Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL) and Korean ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS) were completed. Perinatal and demographic data were collected and analyzed.Results: The mean full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) score in the EP group was significantly lower than that of the term control group (89.1 ± 18.3 vs. 107.1 ± 12.7; P < 0.001).In the EP group, 26 (37%) children had an FSIQ score below 85, compared to only one child (3%) in the control group. Furthermore, the EP group showed significantly worse EF test results (ATA, Stroop test, CCTT, WCST). Except for the higher social immaturity subscore in the EP group, the K-CBCL and K-ARS scores were not different between the two groups. EP children who received laser treatment for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) had an 8.8-fold increased risk of a low FSIQ score, and a 1-point increase in the discharge weight Z-score decreased the risk of a low FSIQ score by approximately half in this EP cohort.Conclusion: This is the first Korean study to investigate the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of school-aged children born EP. In the study cohort, EP children exhibited significantly lower FSIQ scores and EF than their full-term peers, and 37% of them had cognitive problems. Nonetheless, except for social immaturity, the behavioral problems were not different in EP children. Severe ROP and low discharge weight Z-score were identified as independent risk factors for low FSIQ score after adjusting for birth weight."

Previously, “river” and “river water” were distinguished, and “river water” was also divided into “river water as a water resource” and “river water as an object of water conservation” and managed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and the Ministry of Environment, respectively. Recently, the Government Organization Act and River Act were revised. As a result, “river water as a water resource” and “river affairs” were transferred to the Ministry of Environment to lay the institutional foundation for integrated management of rivers in name and reality. However, despite the fact that the departments in charge of rivers have been unified into the Ministry of Environment, there is still the problem of changing the management of rivers according to the purpose or function of existing rivers, such as national, regional, and small rivers. In particular, it is necessary to promote efficient basin integrated management by the basin Management Committee by promoting local rivers to national rivers. This does not simply mean the integration of national and local rivers, but is very important in that it establishes the basis for water management integration by basin. In addition, since more than 60% of water use is for agricultural, the management of agricultural water under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs needs to be switched to the Ministry of Environment. The fact that the current agricultural water management is no different from the existing river management, and in principle, in order to secure the control of the Basin Water Management Committee and the efficiency of water management, the department in charge was changed to the Ministry of Environment, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and other related organizations cooperated. There is a need to improve relevant laws. In addition, the management of water for dams by the K-Water and the management of water for hydroelectric dams by Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd(KHNP) should be unified in order to secure the efficiency of water management integration in that the essence is management of river water. In other words, the river management task is unified into the basin Management Committee and the Ministry of Environment, but in certain cases, the local government or related organizations such as the K-Water are delegated to handle the tasks, but under the direction of the basin Committee and the Ministry of Environment, the integration of river management can be efficiently integrated. It is necessary to prepare relevant laws to do so. In the sense that ‘basin’, the management unit for each basin, is a basic matter of basin management, the management unit should be ‘basin’, but the boundary and division should be directly defined in the Framework Act on Water Management, including not only large basins but also small and medium basins. there is In addition, as a method of realizing basin management, bottom-up basin management centered on sub-basins (or small rivers) is necessary, so it is necessary to reflect this in future legislation."
Detection of Atrial Fibrillation in Short-Lead Electrocardiogram Recordings Obtained using a Smart Scale,2021,,,"Atrial fi brillation (AF) is the type of arrhythmia that raises possibility of severe health problems such as heart failure and stroke and it is known that a major risk factor of AF includes overweight and obesity. Based on this association between such health-related indicators, we propose a smart scale that is capable of measuring weight and electrocardiography (ECG) simultaneously. The scale was developed using Arduino Uno, a Wheatstone bridge load cell, and ECG sensors. The ECG signals were processed to compute heart rate (in other words, RR interval). The smart scale was evaluated with four healthy volunteers in terms of reliability showing high agreement with a commercial device for ECG monitoring. In addition, it implements Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection using machine-learning classifi ers including a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method, a Decision Tree (DT), and a Neural Network (NN) on relatively short recordings of ECG obtained while using the scale. The root mean square of the successive diff erences between heart beats (RMSSD) and the Shannon entropy of the RR interval (ECG features) were extracted from ECG signals for AF detection. Performance of AF detection was tested with patients who were treated at a Cardiology Center after balancing data by applying over- and under-sampling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and the Tomek Link (T-Link) algorithm. After addressing the data imbalance, the AF detection performance of each classifi er (kNN, DT, and NNs) was 98.9%, 97.8%, and 98.9% respectively. This work has successfully demonstrated weight and cardio activity monitoring features while using a scale that may help keep the records of sensitive health related indexes on a daily basis."

In order to carry out the aims and purposes, a literature review was conducted to derive indicators of vulnerable area to PM. Based on the developed indicators, the vulnerable areas and green spaces creation strategies for each cluster were developed for the case of Seongdong-gu, Seoul. As a result, six indicators for vulnerability analysis were came out including the vulnerable groups (children's facilities, old people's facilities), emission sources (air pollutant emission workplaces, roads), and environmental indicators (particulate matter concentration, NDVI). According to the six selected indicators, the target area was divided into 39 hexagons and analyzed to result the most vulnerable areas to particulate matter. As a result of comprehensive vulnerability analysis, the Seongsu-dong area was found to be the most vulnerable to partic ulate matter, and 5 clusters were derived through k-means cluster analysis. Cluster 1 was analyzed as areas that most vulnerable to particulate matter as a result of the comprehensive analysis, therefore urgent need to create green spaces to reduce particulate matter. Cluster 2 was areas that mostly belonged to the Han River. Cluster 3 corresponds to the largest number of hexagons, and since many vulnerable groups are distributed, it was analyzed as a cluster that required the creation of a green spaces to reduce particulate matter, focusing on facilities for vulnerable groups. Three hexagons are included in cluster 4, and the cluster has many roads and lacks vegetation in common. Cluster 5 has a lot of green spaces and is generally distributed with fewer vulnerable groups and emission sources; however, it has a high level of particulate matter concentration. In a situation where various green spaces creation projects for reducing particulate are being implemented, it is necessary to consider the vulnerable groups and emission sources and to present green space creation strategies for each space characteristic in order to increase the effectiveness of such projects. Therefore, this study is regarded as meaningful in suggesting a method for selecting a green area for reducing PM."
Women’s empowerment and transnational consumption of Hallyu in Vietnam,2021,"['Vietnam', 'Hallyu', 'consumer culture', 'women’s empowerment']",,"This paper aims to explore the growing popularity and consumption of Korean popular culture, known as Hallyu (Originating from Chinese, the Korean term, Hallyu is “Hàn lưu” in Vietnamese and pronounced similarly. During our interviews, we used the latter term, and in our survey we referred to “Korean cultural products”) (Korean Wave) amongst young Vietnamese women and examine its socio-cultural implications. To this end, we used in-depth interviews and a survey questionnaire as the main methods of data collection and endeavored to identify the trends and meaning of young women’s consumption of Hallyu products in Vietnam. Findings suggest that these signify the following: (i) the emergence of a new generation of womanhood in Vietnam and their empowerment as modern consumers who navigate consumer choices and complement information through the use of diverse channels, and (ii) their desire to construct a modern and cosmopolitan femininity and lifestyle underpinned by the changing role and status of women in the country. These findings add to a growing body of literature on the transnational consumption of media and goods as well as on women’s empowerment, especially in developing countries."

Conventional methods are very time-consumption and cannot deal with complicated JSSP instances as it uses one optimal algorithm to solve JSSP. This paper proposes an effective scheduler based on deep learning technology named self-supervised long-short term memory (SS-LSTM) to handle complex JSSP accurately. First, using the optimal method to generate sufficient training samples in small-scale JSSP. SS-LSTM is then applied to extract rich feature representations from generated training samples and decide the next action. In the proposed SS-LSTM, two channels are employed to reflect the full production statues. Specifically, the detailed-level channel records 18 detailed product information while the system-level channel reflects the type of whole system states identified by the k-means algorithm. Moreover, adopting a self-supervised mechanism with LSTM autoencoder to keep high feature extraction capacity simultaneously ensuring the reliable feature representative ability. The authors implemented, trained, and compared the proposed method with the other leading learning-based methods on some complicated JSSP instances. The experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness and priority of the proposed method for solving complex JSSP instances in terms of make-span."
Quantification of Hypoxia in Human Glioblastoma using PET with 18F-FMISO,2021,"['FMISO', 'Hypoxia', 'Compartmentalmodeling', 'Spectral analysis']",,"Purpose This study aimed to investigate the results of compartmental modeling (CM) and spectral analysis (SA) generated with dynamic 18F-FMISO tumor images. Besides, the regular tissue-to-blood ratio (TBR) images were derived and compared with the dynamic models.Methods Nine subjects with glioblastoma underwent PET/CT imaging with the 18F-FMISO tracer. The protocol for PET imaging began with 15 min in dynamic mode and two 10-min duration static images at 120 min and 180 min post-injection.We used the two-tissue compartmental model for CM at the voxel basis, and we conducted SA to estimate the 18F-FMISO accumulation within each voxel. We also investigated the usual tumor-to-blood ratio (TBR) for comparison.Results The images of the tumor showed different patterns of hypoxia and necrosis as a function of PET scanning times, while CM and SA methods based on dynamic PET imaging equally located tumor hypoxia. The mean correlation of Ki images of all subjects between CM and SA was 0.63 ± 0.19 (0.24-0.86). CM produced less noisy Ki images than SA, and, in the contrary, SA produced accumulation component images more clear than with CM. CM-Ki and SA-Ki images were correlated with TBR images (r = 0.72 ± 0.20 and 0.56 ± 0.26, respectively). In the only subject having a continuously increasing tumor time-activity curve, the k3 image showed a high uptake in the necrosis region which was not apparent in TBR or Ki images.Conclusion Based on these results, the combination of CM and SA approaches was found more appropriate in generating voxelbased hypoxia images."

As the consumption environment and values keep changing, new research on consumers’ purchase motivation and behavior of local food is necessary. Therefore, this study examined three dimensions of purchase motivation; ‘food choice motivation’ in that local food is a kind of food, ‘altruistic motivation’ in that local food has a value that is pro-social and environmentally-friendly, and ‘other-oriented motivation’ in that local food is gaining popularity recently. Local food is beneficial to individuals, society, and the environment, and thus this study discussed methods for further promoting local food consumption based on the characteristics and purchase behavior of each consumer type categorized according to local food purchase motivations.This study conducted a nationwide survey of 528 adult consumers in their 20s to 60s who have purchased local food and then examined their demographic characteristics, purchase motivation for local food, and purchase behavior regarding local food. Using SPSS 25.0, this study examined the overall trend of local food purchase behavior through descriptive statistics and frequency analysis, derived five sub-factors of local food purchase motivation through exploratory factor analysis, and then categorized consumers into six groups through K-means clustering. Then, this study conducted a chi-square test and ANOVA with Duncan’s new multiple range test to identify a significant difference in demographic characteristics and purchase behavior between consumer types.As a result of the analysis, it was found that the overall degree of purchase by local food consumers in Korea is not high. When purchasing local food offline, it was found that large discount stores, small and medium-sized supermarkets, and local food stores were mainly used, and when buying online, online shopping malls and online malls for large discount stores were mainly used. It was also shown that the quality of the product, reasonable price, and convenience of use are considered important when selecting where to buy local food. The purchase motivation appeared in the order of functional motivation, economic motivation, altruistic motivation, access motivation, and other-oriented motivation. Thus, it was confirmed that the quality of local food, such as health, safety, and taste, is the strongest among local food purchase motivations. As a result of categorizing local food consumers into six clusters according to five local food purchase motivations, it was found in the order of ‘various motivation type(30.1%),’ ‘no motivation type(20.1%),’ ‘social and environmental-oriented type(19.3%),’ ‘price-oriented type(11.0%),’ ‘quality-oriented type(9.8%),’ and ‘experience-oriented type(9.7%).’ In addition to demographic characteristics, consumer types were analyzed to have significant differences between groups in overall local food purchase behavior, such as local food purchase level, purchase frequency, purchase cost, and also have differences in purchase channel and diffusion behavior.In conclusion, it was found that consumers with multiple local food purchase motivations have a higher degree of purchase and tend to purchase local food consciously rather than other foods. When the quality of local food is outstanding, some consumers purchase it even if the price is high, so actively promoting the excellence of quality will help improve local food consumption. In addition, local food should be sold on various distribution channels, and it should be promoted to create a consumption environment where its perceived value can be increased."

They seems to be confused by Harbin under the rule of Japanese colony, but in fact it shows through Mimicry that Lee Hyo-seok""s Endless Blue Sky secretly resists and negates the colonization by means of symbol.  second, in Lee Hyo-seok""s novel Endless Blue Sky, the main characters are placed in an ambiguous position of being neither completely relegated nor incorporated into the center, so The third space is not a place where control and power are unilaterally carried out. It means cultural resistance in that it is a space where niche strategies are practiced creatively.  Also, Lee Hyo-seok accused the falsehood of the ruling class by recreating the image of the subaltern called “Jukjeong” in the novel Endless Blue Sky. In addition, he explored solidarity with the possibility of overcoming Japanese imperialism. as an alternative to overcoming Japanese imperialism, we explored the solidarity of “Jukjeong consciousness”.  The author skillfully depicts the image of the postcolonialism by Homi K. Bhabha and Gayatri C.

Media content is developed around evolving digital content, and is increasingly becoming realistic as the virtual and real worlds converge in a variety of fields and spaces. (Method) The study method involved first examining the concept and types of realistic content through a literature survey. Second, it involved investigating the ratio of realistic content used to where it was not in the exhibition space. Third, the expected benefits of realistic content in each case were estimated. The study suggests the direction for use of realistic content in exhibition space design by the central government and local municipalities. Realistic content is considered the most suitable exhibition media for virtual reality (VR), augmented/mixed reality (AR/MR), hologram convergence, and media facade content in exhibitions. Therefore, this study limited its investigation to immersive types of realistic content. (Results) The exhibition space of the Ulsan Safety Experience Center consists of a 4D stereoscopic video hall, an AR earthquake disaster experience, and a 3D CG cinematic. The realistic content was produced with VR and AR for the exhibition, which accounted for 77.6% of the exhibition area on the third floor. The National Aviation Museum configured its exhibition space with experience-linked VR content, where realistic contents occupied 20.0% of the exhibition space. As exhibits at the Jeju Play K-Pop were planned for realistic content, they are mainly categorized into “Live 360,” which consists of 3D animation video media, and “Live Holo,” which is a hologram concert. The Dinosaur AR Experience Zone at the Gyeongnam Goseong Dinosaur Expo consists of the XR Dinosaur Live Park and the Safari Movie Theater. The exhibition media are produced with realistic VR and AR “killer” content for an application rate as high as 100%, meaning they cover the entire exhibition area. The National Ocean Science Museum has configured its exhibition space with a hanging VR simulator, 5D movie theater, and AR taking up half of the permanent exhibition hall on the third floor to make it easier to view marine and deep-sea life that are generally not easily accessible. The exhibition media are produced with VR and AR-based realistic content, and occupy a relatively high ratio of the exhibition area, at 30.0%. (Conclusions) An analysis of each case showed that realistic content is firmly established as the leading media content for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and that the exhibition state is organized of “killer” content. This analysis implies that more cultural infrastructure can be expected that features exhibition space with realistic content."

In Survey 2, however, a confirmatory factor analysis shows that the model fit is lower than in Study 1. This result may be due to the small sample size. Therefore, in future studies, it will be necessary to re-verify the factor validity by reinforcing the number of cases. Nevertheless, the K-SISRI shows good reliability and validity overall.

발달성 난독 초등 1학년생의 읽기 심도와 단어 및 음절구조에 따른 단어 해독력,2021,"['한국어', '발달성 난독증', '해독 심도 집단', '음절 종성 해독 구성소', 'Korean', 'Developmental dyslexia', 'Severity of decoding difficulties', 'Grain size of syllable-final graphemes']","배경 및 목적: 본 연구는 한국 발달성 난독 초등 1학년 집단을 읽기능력 심도로 나누어 단어의 의미 유무, 단어구조 및 음절 내 위치에 따른 읽기 특성을 알아보고자 하였다. 방법: 한국 초등 1학년 발달성 난독 아동 20명에게 한국어 읽기검사(KOLRA)의 하위 검사인 단어해독과제를 실시하였다. 대상아동의 경우, 듣기이해력과 지능검사에서 정상범주에 속하였음에도 심도의 단어읽기능력을 가진 아동이었다. 단어 해독능력에 따라 심도 집단과 경심도 집단으로 나누었으며, 자소-음소 일치형 단어를 의미 유무, 단어구조, 음절 내 위치에 따른 집단 차이를 비교하였다. 결과: 심도 집단과 경심도 집단 모두 의미 단어 읽기와 무의미 단어 읽기 사이의 수행 차이가 나타났다. 두 집단은 모두 단어 내 종성 자소 해독에 어려움을 보였는데, 심도 집단의 경우 종성 자소의 개수가 2개일 때 현저한 해독의 어려움이 나타났다. 또한 두 집단은 초성 자소 읽기에 유사한 수행을 보였으나, 심도 집단의 경우 경심도 집단에 비해 중성 자소, 종성 자소 읽기에 더욱 어려움을 보였다. 논의 및 결론: 한국 발달성 난독 초등 1학년 아동들은 단어와 음절구조를 고려한 단어 해독 지원이 신속히 이루어져야 할 것으로 보인다. 따라서 어휘경로를 활용한 의미 단어 읽기뿐만 아니라 중성 및 종성 자소의 구성소 단위(grain size)를 고려한 무의미단어를 통해 비어휘경로를 활성화시킴으로써 심도의 난독증을 가진 한국아동의 단어해독능력을 촉진시킬 수 있을 것이다.","Objectives: This study investigated word decoding abilities of 1st graders with Developmental dyslexia according to the level of decoding difficulty, meaning availability, word and syllable structure. Methods: Twenty Korean 1st graders with developmental dyslexia participated in 40 word-reading tasks individually. All of them had severe decoding difficulties, even with normal listening comprehension (KORLA; Pae et al., 2015) and intelligence (K-CTONI-2; Park, 2014). The group differences by decoding difficulties were compared considering the meaning of words, the number of syllable-final graphemes, and the position of each grapheme in a syllable. Results: Both the severe and less-severe group in Korean word-decoding difficulties revealed the gaps between word reading and nonword reading. Both groups had decoding difficulties when a word had syllable-final graphemes, while the severe group had even lower performances in word readings with 2 syllable-final graphemes. Both groups showed similar performances in reading syllable-initial graphemes while the severe group had lower performances both in reading syllable-medial vowel graphemes and syllable-final consonant graphemes compared to the less-severe group. Conclusion: Korean 1st graders with developmental dyslexia seemed to be in urgent need of decoding support considering word and syllable structure. Triggering the non-lexical route with non-words considering the grain size of syllable-medial vowel graphemes and syllable-final graphemes would facilitate word decoding abilities of severely dyslexic Korean children."

베르그송의 직관 개념과 『주역』 곤괘 육이(六二) 해석,2021,"['직관', '지성', '창조', '문명', '중국 철학사', 'Intuition', 'Intelligence', 'Creation', 'Civilization', 'History of Chinese philosophy']",,"Bergson’s concept of intuition is not easy to understand. He said the real truth in a world of creative evolution can be seen by intuition, not by intelligence. Intelligence and intuition can be viewed as the two main sides of the human mind with opposite tendencies. Intelligence was originally created in the process of building efficient methods of production and construction. So intelligence has a tendency to obsess over recreating the same endlessly. The world of living is bound to be the main tendency to create new things. So intelligence can only be said to be a human ability that has fundamental limitations in applying it to life. In other words, intelligence cannot see life directly. So intuition is a valuable way of perception in that there is no other alternative to life recognition. But intuition is the direction of thought that seems difficult and vague. So human society tends to avoid creating intuitively driven cultures, or introducing new cultures. In view of human civilizations, the period of creation was truly ephemeral, and the period of imitation and complacency occupied most of the history of those civilizations.It is considered very important to know whether these Bergson’s words are universally applicable. So I applied the distinction between Bergson’s intuition and intelligence to Chinese philosophy. I used the Book of Changes’s main character “K'un’s (The Receptive’s) Six in the second place means: Straight, square, great. Without purpose, Yet nothing remains unfurthered(坤卦, 六二, 直方大, 不習无不利)” to manipulate the contents of complex Chinese philosophy as simple as possible. In other words, the orientation of this paper was developed in a way that observes the changes in interpretation of this content, with the changing times. As a result, Bergson’s notion of intuition and intelligence was also found to be quite useful in distinguishing history of Chinese philosophy."

Sarvāstivāda understood the pratītyasamutpādasūtra as the perfect one (nitārtha) while Sthavira identified it as the being imperfect one (neyārtha). The reason being that although the pratītyasamutpāda of 12 branches is only applicable to sentient beings, the two formulas are applicable to sentient and non-sentients being (namely sarvam saṃskṛta), and also take the form of presenting (uddeśa: 摽) and interpreting topics (nirdeśa: 釋). As a result, he was able to criticize Sarvāstivāda’s theory of dependent origination based on the stage of reincarnation (avasthā) and momentariness (kṣaṇika). Sthavira therefore stipulated that the two formulas indicate that the phenomenon (saṃskṛtadharmas) occurs in various conditions, but again presented two interpretations based on his theory of causal inheritance (因果相續). First, the previous formula is indicates the abiding (sthiti) of the phenomenon. In other words, the phenomenon is streamed as a causality without disconnection. The following formula indicates that these causalities are not a simultaneous but a series of sequential-continuous arising (utpāda). Second, Sthavira interpreted the two formulas on the basis of the theory of kṣaṇabhaṅga (刹那滅) and abhūtvā bhāva (本無今有). In this context the previous one means that when the effect exists, there is a destruction of the cause. In that case, the effect arise from the extinction of cause, namely nonexistence. And dhus the sutra states the following. “This (=cause) arises then that (=result) arises.” Meanwhile, Badhanta Rāma, Sthavira’s disciple, interpreted the two formulas according to the theory of a seed, i.e. saṃtatipariṇāmaviśeṣa. He describes it as a causality based on immediate cause (sākṣāt-hetu), and indirect cause (pāraṃparyam-hetu), respectively. In conclusion, Sthavira and his sect (Sautrāntika) interpreted the two formulas of Dependent Origination based on their main doctrine, the theory of anudhātu (隨界)/bīja (種子). In particular, the interpretation of the Sthavira reflects the fact that the Sautrāntika’s unique theory of causal inheritance based on sequential-causality, and this explanation corresponds with those who claim that only a moments exist (kṣaṇika)."

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed SIA changes for 1 year after surgery in patients who received only cataract surgery using phacoemulsification (group 1) and patients who underwent 23-gauge sutureless vitrectomy and cataract surgery together (group 2). Flat keratometry (K1), steep keratometry (K2), and astigmatism axis were measured with automatic keratometry before and after the surgery. Vector analysis was used to calculate SIA at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. We then examined whether the SIA values at each time point were different between the two groups. Results: A total of 86 eyes were included in this study (group 1, n = 45; group 2, n = 41). The mean SIA values calculated at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery in group 1 were 0.83 ± 0.37, 0.69 ± 0.39, 0.60 ± 0.33, and 0.59 ± 0.33, respectively. In group 2, the values were 0.82 ± 0.47, 0.69 ± 0.38, 0.62 ± 0.28, and 0.61 ± 0.30, respectively. Over time, SIA decreased in both groups (all p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean SIA between the two groups at each follow-up time point after surgery (p = 0.296, p = 0.728, p = 0.361, and p = 0.356, respectively). Conclusions: When 23-gauge sutureless vitrectomy and cataract surgery were performed together, the astigmatism change caused by surgery did not show a significant difference compared with that of the group who received cataract surgery only. Thus, 23-gauge sutureless vitrectomy may not significantly affect corneal astigmatism."
다기간 자료포락분석을 이용한 전기차 충전소 효율성 변화 분석,2021,"['Electric Vehicle', 'Charging Station', 'Efficiency', 'Multi-Period Data Envelopment Analysis']",,"It is highly challenging to measure the efficiency of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) because factors affecting operational characteristics of EVCSs are time-varying in practice. For the efficiency measurement, environmental factors around the EVCSs can be considered because such factors affect charging behaviors of electric vehicle drivers, resulting in variations of accessibility and attractiveness for the EVCSs. Considering dynamics of the factors, this paper examines the technical efficiency of 622 electric vehicle charging stations in Seoul using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The DEA is formulated as a multi-period output-oriented constant return to scale model. Five inputs including floating population, number of nearby EVCSs, average distance of nearby EVCSs, traffic volume and traffic congestion are considered and the charging frequency of EVCSs is used as the output. The result of efficiency measurement shows that not many EVCSs has most of charging demand at certain periods of time, while the others are facing with anemic charging demand. Tobit regression analyses show that the traffic congestion negatively affects the efficiency of EVCSs, while the traffic volume and the number of nearby EVCSs are positive factors improving the efficiency around EVCSs. We draw some notable characteristics of efficient EVCSs by comparing means of the inputs related to the groups classified by K-means clustering algorithm. This analysis presents that efficient EVCSs can be generally characterized with the high number of nearby EVCSs and low level of the traffic congestion."

The liberal arts writing class for the second semester of 2021, which was conducted non-face-to-face, was a personal PBL called 'Writing on COVID-19', and was designed to enable the learner to focus on the procedural and academic knowledge of writing required in University liberal arts education.The personal project covered in this paper is structured with the following. The characteristic of the PBL class conducted over 7 sessions is that it was structured so that ‘critique and growth’ was occurred through reflection before the evaluation of the procedure and final assignments. In other words, through the expansion of writing on COVID-19, learners found materials suitable for their own topic and wrote in accordance with procedural knowledge, in the process of ‘communication competency’, ‘resource information technology utilization competency’, and ‘comprehensive thinking competency’ could have been developed.The theme COVID-19 was designed with the focus on the liberal arts goal as a ‘global citizen’ by linking the ‘authentics’, one of the 6 elements of PBL with the level of learners as freshmen and with the high school subjects. The second characteristic is that the task of this class model is that precedes the lecture. In order to stimulate the learners’ original perspective and logic, the subject to be dealt with in the next step was performed as an assignment.  Lastly, unlike the general PBL course, it is a scaffolding class model in which ‘reflection’ takes place before the final result. The class was designed so that the result of ‘reflection’ could be actively worked in the final result by designing the class model by focusing on the functional meaning of reflection of ‘criticism and correction’ of reflection, usually connected with evaluation."

Although brutal battle scenes or an exaggerated figure of a soldier do not appear in the illustrations of the war, we have examined “Nishiki-e” from a broad perspective of dealing with the illustrations of the war. In this way, the empress was recreated as a representation of an ideal “Home Front” and functioned as a suitable propaganda model for mobilizing Japanese women for war. The emergence and representation of the “Home Front” played an important role as a basis of change with regard to the social status of women. The existence of the empress was emphasized as a representative model during the war. Furthermore, the image of Empress Kōjun from the illustrations of the war overlaps with the representation of Empress Shōken during the Pacific War. Hence, we have looked into the succession of the image of the “Home Front” to posterity. In this paper, we have focused on another form of war in mainland Japan and the nationalization of women through the meaning of the “Home Front” representation system of the empress."

We also analyzed the influence and sensitivity changes in each industry after the large mall was entered in the region.  Consumer and sales commercial transaction history were extracted using credit card panel data while keeping the personal information regulation law. We extracted 45 consumer trade areas and 38 sales trade areas from the data by k-means methodology by Sklearn, python. Five regression equations based on the gravity model were estimated for each industry, and the estimated summary of each regression equation is shown in <Table 1> below.  <Table 2> shows the differences according to the age of the consumer, the existing or new store, and the operating periods of each store. It can be said that the estimated parameters vary by industry. The constant term shows the average size of transactions for each industry, for example, large malls and fashion stores relatively large, and restaurants and discount stores in order.  In the case of large-scale stores, the purchasing power of 30-45 year-old (0.089) is higher than that of other age groups, while at convenience stores, the younger age group, under 30 (0.174), have higher purchasing power. In restaurants, the purchasing power (0.114) of young people under the age of 30 is also high. As discount stores include supermarkets, it is found that those over 45 (0.292) have higher purchasing power than the younger generation. It can be seen that the purchasing power (0.356) of the 30-45 year old is also high in the fashion store.  <Figure 1> shows that the closer they are in all industries, the more they purchase. Discount stores and restaurants are sensitive to distance. Fashion stores are less sensitive to purchases even if they moved farther away.  Below, we show the characteristics of consumer and sales trade area using the estimated parameters and the amount of effects that are calculated as parameters multiplied by size of transaction.  In <Figure 2>, the consumer trade area is shown on the horizontal axis and the size of the parameter by industry of the consumer trade area is on the vertical axis. In <Figure 3>, the magnitude of each consumer trade area influence is expressed as the size of the circle of the point where the consumer trade area is located.  <Figure 4> and <Figure 5> are analysis results related to the sales trade area. This analysis also makes it easy to identify the differences in characteristics of sales trade area.  Under the current model structure, it is also possible to compare changes in commercial areas after large-scale stores enter. We can easily check how the influence of the consumer and sales trade area or the influence of the street changed after the large mall entered.  After entering a large-scale mall, the influence of new stores has increased compared to that of existing stores in sales businesses. In the case of discount stores, the influence of the 30-45-year-old consumer trade area has increased, which may be caused by the increase in the inflow population with new consumption capabilities.  <Figure 6> shows the impact of distance between consumer and sales trade area. After entering the large-scale mall, there is little change in convenience stores, but the sales"

The reference of the letter is Chapter Wényán Zhuàn(｢文言傳｣) in the Zhōu Yì( 『周易』), and in the Zhu Xi school, the time-based and qualitative deviations of tiān(天) were presumed. It’s difficult to find the same view of the world in the philosophy of Chéng Yí(程頤), a contemporary figure with Shào Yōng(邵雍). Kǒng Yǐng Dá(孔穎達) in Tang Dynasty also understood ‘xiāntiān(先天)’ and ‘hòutiān(後天)’ simply as ‘doing what one does at each solar terms in advance’ and ‘doing what one does at each solar terms later’, and didn’t attach any special meanings to the letters themselves. In Han Dynasty, particularly in the Later Han Dynasty, the emperor explained about ‘the situation when the time of the actual movements of the sun was different from the dates of the solar terms in the book calendar, quoting the very sentence of the Wényán Zhuàn(｢文言傳｣) mentioning xiāntiān(先天) and hòutiān(後天). In this case, the letter, ‘tiān(天)’, means ‘the date following the actual solar terms’ while xiāntiān(先天) and hòutiān(後天) refer to ‘doing ahead of the solar terms’ and ‘doing after the solar terms’. In lìxiàng(曆象: diverse astronomical phenomena of the sun, the moon, stars and other celestial bodies), the phenomenon of xiāntiān(先天) was, in fact, just a nominal phrase without making any problems. On the other hand, the hòutiān(後天) phenomenon occurring because of precession progressed subtly, became intense unknowingly, and its reason was not clear at that time, so it caused the sovereign ruler to worry about it a lot. Among history books and all the other books of the Former Han and the Later Han, ‘the longitude degree of the twenty-eight solar stages along the zodiac(the twenty-eight lunar mansions, 28宿) on the winter solstice’ showing the time of Han Dynasty is mentioned six times in total. When those dividing into the two kinds of time, the celestial longitude and the right ascension, are included, it’s mentioned nine times in total. All of these are recorded in the Hòu Hàn Shū( 『後漢書』), a history book of the Later Han Dynasty, but when the precession values are calculated, most of the time directed by them is the time of the Former Han, and one case of the time as far as during Emperor Qín Shǐ Huáng(秦始皇)'s time is included."

SK 제51송에서 제시하는 8성취와 주석서들의 해석은 수행법 탐구에 있어 중요한 열쇠가 된다. 특히 주석서중 『금칠십론』이 제시한 6행관은 지혜를 완성하는 과정을 6단계로 나누어 체계적으로 설명하고 있다. 그것은 진리의 대상인 25원리(tattva)를 반복적으로 사색/통찰하는 수행법으로서 제시된 것이다. 물론 6행관이 다른 주석서에는 언급되지 않고 오직 『금칠십론』에서만 언급된다는 점에서, 역자인 진제(眞諦)의 가필(加筆)일 가능성도 있다. 그러나 6행관은 상키야 수행법 탐구에 있어 상키야 특유의 수행법을 제시한다는 점에서 상당한 의의가 있다.","This article discusses the practical principles and means of Sāṃkhya Philosophy which is based on the original text of Sāṃkhya-Kārikā. Sāṃkhya-Kārikā however does not systemically cite the practical principles and steps as they are in the Yoga and Buddism. It maybe be due to related literature being scattered, or putting sole emphasis on the knowledge of the 25 principles of Sāṃkhya Philosophy. In the Sāṃkhya-Kārikā, what it is deserved to study as the foundation of practical means is the 8 attainments of the 51steulogy, which are ① reasoning(ūha), ② hearing(śabda), ③ studying(adhyayana), ④ ⑤ ⑥ cessation of three kinds of sufferings(duḥkhavigh-ātatraya), ⑦ acquiring friends(suhṛtprāpti), ⑧ purity(dāna). All attainments originate from wisdom from reasoning, speech(language), studying, suffering, friends, and purity. In other words, these eight attainments are just practical means to achieving wisdom. Practical means in Sāṃkhya is not known compared with those in Yoga in general. Therefore, a study of practical means in Sāṃkhya has an important meaning to inform the Yoga of wisdom(jñāna-yoga) to the general public. The interpretation of 8 attainments presented in the 51steulogy and commentary books becomes the important keys. Particularly, 6 observations of practical means which the 金七十論 presents explain systemically dividing the process that completes the wisdom into 6 steps. It is presented as the practical means which reason/discern repeatedly the 25 principles(tattva), the objects of truth. Of cause, in the point that 6 observations of practical means is cited only in the 金七十論 while they are not in other commentary books, there could be a possibility which they are the retouch of Paramārtha(眞諦), the interpreter. However, 6 obervations of practical means have significance in being study Sāṃkhya which present unique one."
Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview-Korean Version: Psychometric Properties,2021,"['SITBI-K', 'Non-suicidal self-injury', 'Suicidal behavior disorder']",,"Objective There is currently no structured interview tool developed that comprehensively evaluates self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB) in Korea. The Self-injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) collectively measures suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, attempts, and non-suicidal self-injuries (NSSI). The SITBI’s reliability and validity have been established with it being widely used in English speaking countries. This study evaluated the psychometric validity of the Korean version of the SITBI (SITBI-K). Methods The SITBI’s validity as a diagnostic assessment tool for NSSI and suicidal behavior disorder (SBD), as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition, was examined. Analyses were performed on 108 university students reporting experiences of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (female 84.26%, mean age=22.10, ±SD 3.33). Results The SITBI-K displayed excellent interrater reliability, with a credible test-retest reliability at two months. Construct validity examined the correlation between the SITBI-K’s modules and approved the self-report results. Appropriate convergent and discriminant validities were obtained for suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, attempts, and NSSI. Conclusion The SITBI-K showed excellent psychometric validity at a level comparable to the original. Its clinical utility for both NSSI and SBD diagnoses was confirmed."

Based on the case of K teacher, the meaning of curriculum development by teachers is discussed. First, The curriculum developed by teachers could be seen as one of local curriculum developed following the national curriculum. Second, The activities performed by teachers can be regarded as curriculum development activities in that they select and organize contents by linking and synthesizing local(student) demands and the contents of the given curriculum(the standards presented in the national curriculum). Third, it can be seen that the curriculum developed by teachers is a ‘programmatic curriculum’ because of its form as a unit. Fourth, teachers who develop curriculum locally continue to develop their curriculum before and during the implementation process, and they finally complete their curriculum only after its implementation in class. This is one of the characteristics found in local curriculum development by teachers."

In Caenorhabditis elegans, many genes affecting cuticle structure, cell growth, and proliferation have been identified to regulate the worm's overall morphology, including body size. While various mutations in those genes directly result in changes in the morphological phenotypes, there is still a need for established, clear, and distinct standards to determine the apparent abnormality in a worm's size and shape. In this study, we measured the body length, body width, terminal bulb length, and head size of mutant worms with reported Dumpy (Dpy), Small (Sma) or Long (Lon) phenotypes by plotting and comparing their respective ratios of various parameters. These results show that the Sma phenotypes are proportionally smaller overall with mild stoutness, and Dpy phenotypes are significantly stouter and have disproportionally small head size. This study provides a standard platform for determining morphological phenotypes designating and annotating mutants that exhibit body shape variations, defining the morphological phenotype of previously unexamined mutants."
PSO-optimized Pareto and Nash equilibrium gaming-based power allocation technique for multistatic radar network,2021,"['Kernel fuzzy C-means', 'multiple input multiple output', 'Nash equilibrium', 'particle swarm optimization', 'power allocation']",,"At present, multiple input multiple output radars offer accurate target detection and better target parameter estimation with higher resolution in high-speed wireless communication systems. This study focuses primarily on power allocation to improve the performance of radars owing to the sparsity of targets in the spatial velocity domain. First, the radars are clustered using the kernel fuzzy C-means algorithm. Next, cooperative and noncooperative clusters are extracted based on the distance measured using the kernel fuzzy C-means algorithm. The power is allocated to cooperative clusters using the Pareto optimality particle swarm optimization algorithm. In addition, the Nash equilibrium particle swarm optimization algorithm is used for allocating power in the noncooperative clusters. The process of allocating power to cooperative and noncooperative clusters reduces the overall transmission power of the radars. In the experimental section, the proposed method obtained the power consumption of 0.014 to 0.0119 at K = 2, M = 3 and K = 2, M = 3, which is better compared to the existing methodologies-generalized Nash game and cooperative and noncooperative game theory."

Task2K가 Sa 분조 계산식에 근일점 천문변수를 고려하지 않아서, 두 프로그램 간에 약 78°의 지각 차가 났으며, 이들 진폭 차이는 1 cm 이하였다. 우리나라 연안에서는 Sa 조화상수가 해마다 크게 다르므로, 조위 예측 정확도와 관련하여 안정적인 조화상수 산출에 필요한 적절한 자료 길이를 결정하기 위해 관측자료 길이(1년, 2년, 3년, 5년, 9년, 19년)에 따른 인천 조위관측소의 Sa 조화상수 값의 변동성을 살펴보았다. 대표성 있는 Sa 조화상수를 구하기 위해서 조화분해를 수행할 때 5~9년 동안의 관측자료를 사용하면 조화상수 예측오차가 상당히 줄어들며, 19년 자료를 사용 것이 가장 바람직하다는 결론을 얻었다. Sa 분조의 진폭은 각 해역별로 다른 해양·대기 환경 특성에 의해 서해안에서 15.0~18.6 cm, 제주도를 포함한 남해안에서 10.7~17.5 cm이었으며, 울릉도를 포함한 동해안에서 10.5~13.0 cm이었다. 울릉도 등 동해 일부 해역을 제외하고 우리나라 연안에서 Ssa 분조의 영향으로 인해 연중 최고(최저) 해수면 높이가 발생하는 시기가 늦어(빨라)져서 해수면의 계절변화가 시간적으로 비대칭적인 특성을 보였다. 끝으로, 월평균 해수면, 대기압 보정 해수면, 비부피 높이 간 관계로부터 해수면의 해해변화와 계절변화의 비대칭성에 대기압 효과와 해수밀도가 가장 큰 영향을 끼친다는 사실을 확인하였다.","The solar annual (Sa) and semiannual (Ssa) tides account for much of the non-uniform annual and seasonal variability observed in sea levels. These non-equilibrium tides depend on atmospheric variations, forced by changes in the Sun's distance and declination, as well as on hydrographic conditions. Here we employ tidal harmonic analyses to calculate Sa and Ssa harmonic constants for 21 Korean coastal tidal stations (TS), operated by the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. We used 19 year-long (1999 to 2017) 1 hr-interval sea level records from each site, and used two conventional harmonic analysis (HA) programs (Task2K and UTide). The stability of Sa harmonic constants was estimated with respect to starting date and record length of the data, and we examined the spatial distribution of the calculated Sa and Ssa harmonic constants. HA was performed on Incheon TS (ITS) records using 369-day subsets; the first start date was January 1, 1999, the subsequent data subset starting 24 hours later, and so on up until the final start date was December 27, 2017. Variations in the Sa constants produced by the two HA packages had similar magnitudes and start date sensitivity. Results from the two HA packages had a large difference in phase lag (about 78°) but relatively small amplitude (<1 cm) difference. The phase lag difference occurred in large part since Task2K excludes the perihelion astronomical variable. Sensitivity of the ITS Sa constants to data record length (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 19 years) was also tested to determine the data length needed to yield stable Sa results. HA results revealed that 5 to 9 year sea level records could estimate Sa harmonic constants with relatively small error, while the best results are produced using 19 year-long records. As noted earlier, Sa amplitudes vary with regional hydrographic and atmospheric conditions. Sa amplitudes at the twenty one TS ranged from 15.0 to 18.6 cm, 10.7 to 17.5 cm, and 10.5 to 13.0 cm, along the west coast, south coast including Jejudo, and east coast including Ulleungdo, respectively. Except at Ulleungdo, it was found that the Ssa constituent contributes to produce asymmetric seasonal sea level variation and it delays (hastens) the highest (lowest) sea levels. Comparisons between monthly mean, air-pressure adjusted, and steric sea level variations revealed that year-to-year and asymmetric seasonal variations in sea levels were largely produced by steric sea level variation and inverted barometer effect."

By employing the results of existing experimental data on the ability of heat transfer by each phonon mode based on the phonon mean free path, its spectral distributions in silicon were discussed under the conditions of 100K, 300K, and 500K. As temperature increased, the contribution of the LA phonon mode to the thermal conductivity increased, and at a temperature of 100K, a critical frequency existed owing to the relative influence between the phonon-phonon scattering and impurity–phonon scattering processes.

Clinical utilization of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate: a retrospective single center study,2021,"['Prothrombin complex concentrate', 'Anticoagulants', 'Blood coagulation factors', 'Vitamin K']",,"Objective Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2013 for management of severely bleeding patients on warfarin therapy. We describe use of 4F-PCC at a large, suburban academic center. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all patients receiving 4F-PCC from its introduction through 2016 at a large level 1 trauma center. Clinical and demographic data were obtained, including indications for anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents, comorbidities, concomitant medications, etiology and site of bleeding, as well as disposition, length of stay, mortality, and thrombotic events. Results One hundred eighty-four patients received 4F-PCC. Mean age was 72 years; 40.8% were female. Indications for 4F-PCC administration included: active bleeding (74%), reversal prior to a procedure (14%), and elevated international normalized ratio (12%). Warfarin was the most common concomitant medication (71.1%). Most patients were receiving anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (63%). Concomitant treatments for bleeding included vitamin K (58.2%), packed red blood cells (50%), fresh frozen plasma (38%), and platelets (26.1%), amongst others. Median length of hospital stay was 8.4 days. Nine patients (4.9%) developed thrombosis within 90 days of 4F-PCC. Mortality was 24.5%, with notably higher rates amongst those who received 4F-PCC for off-label indications (19.1% on-label mortality vs. 37.7% off-label mortality on chi-square analysis, P=0.01). Conclusion This study demonstrates that 4F-PCC is being utilized for indications other than the reversal of warfarin-induced coagulopathy. Further investigation is warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of 4F-PCC for these potential indications."
Cats Climb Entails Mammals Move: Preserving Hyponymy in Compositional Distributional Semantics,2021,"['hyponymy', 'matrix-based representations of meaning', 'pos-itive semidefinite matrices', 'completely positive maps']",,"To give vector-based representations of meaning more structure, an approach proposed in Piedeleu et al. (2015); Sadrzadeh et al. (2018); Bankova et al. (2018) is to use positive semidefinite (psd) matrices. These allow us to model similarity of words as well as the hyponymy or is-a relationship. To compose words to form phrases and sentences, we may represent adjectives, verbs, and other functional words as multilinear, positivity preserving maps, following the compositional distributional approach introduced in Coecke et al. (2010) and extended to the realm of psd matrices in Piedeleu et al. (2015), but it is not clear how to learn representations of functional words when working with psd matrices. In this paper, we introduce a generic way of composing the psd matrices corresponding to words. We propose that psd matrices for verbs, adjectives, and other functional words be lifted to completely positive (CP) maps that match their grammatical type. This lifting is carried out by our composition rule called Compression, Compr. In contrast to previous composition rules like Fuzz and Phaser (Coecke and Meichanetzidis, 2020) (a.k.a. KMult and BMult (Lewis, 2019a)), Compr preserves hyponymy. Mathematically, Compr is itself a CP map, and is therefore linear and generally non-commutative. We give a number of proposals for the structure of Compr, based on spiders, cups, and caps, and generate a range of composition rules. We test these rules on sentence entailment datasets from Kartsaklis and Sadrzadeh (2016), and see some improvements over the performance of Fuzz and Phaser. We go on to estimate the parameters of a simplified form of Compr based on entailment information from the aforementioned datasets, and find that whilst this learnt operator does not consistently outperform previously proposed mechanisms, it is competitive and has the potential to improve with the use of a less simplified version."

The species is known to contain phytochemicals that have beneficial effects on human health, and it is economically important in bioindustry. Because of the limited number of plants in a small range of habitats, the mass-propagation method should be developed for use and conservation. In vitro tissue culture is a reliable method in terms of mass propagation from selected clones of the species. We investigated the optimal conditions of the medium in this process, especially focusing on the concentrations of plant growth regulators(PGRs) in the culture of stem-containing axillary buds. Three statistical methods, i.e., ANOVA, response surface method(RSM), and fuzzy clustering were used to analyze the plant growth, number of shoots induced, and shoot length with various combinations of PGRs. Results from the RSM differed from those of the other two methods; thus, the method was not suitable. ANOVA and fuzzy clustering showed similar results. However, more accurate results were obtained using fuzzy clustering because it provided a probability for each treatment. On the basis of the fuzzy clustering analysis, stem tissue produced the greatest number of shoots(11.03 per explant; 63.33%) on a medium supplemented with 5-μM 6-benzylaminopurine and 2.5-μM thidiazuron(TDZ).

At the center of this perspective is a discussion on the particular, which is ultimately the only object of valid cognition. There has been confusion with regard to this discussion because the Pramāṇa school encompasses both the epistemology of Yogācāra and Sautrāntika. Thus, the aim of this paper is a systematic understanding of Darmakīrti’s view of Sautrāntika, which has been broken down into the following six points.First, the object of valid cognition includes the following two points: there is the svalakṣaṇa, which has the effect of beneficial works (arthakriyā), and there is nothing that is not real (vastu). Second, the svalakṣaṇa is the only object of valid cognition. The beneficial works, or arthakriyā, refers to the external object that, like a projection or an image exists as a cognition. Third, the particular is a projection of the way something appears (ākāra) in the external world. The object with this ability is grasped as an object for the perceiver. Fourth, the reason why the particular cannot be expressed in language is because it is the object of sense perception which occurs clearly. Fifth, the reason why the particular and the universal characteristics do not have the same identity is that the particular does not occur in different times and spaces. Therefore, the sense perception is not expressed in language and is directed towards the real nature of being able to act effectively on meaningful objects. Sixth, human linguistic activities are caused by the awakening of the seeds of the memory and the activation of desire due to the imprints of previously perceived objects. In the case of the particular, it is hard to determine if it is under the influence of a direct causal relationship with imprints because it is simply a leading action or if it is a direct cause of linguistic based cognition."

After the implementation of the market economy, Mongolian society experienced the concentration of population to Ulaanbaatar, the housing shortage, and the deterioration of the residential environment, and the Mongolian government sought to provide housing through regional development. However, the housing supply through such a development is likely to amplify the spatial gap between the existing Ger district and urban areas, leading to social and economic gaps beyond the physical gap, leading to social exclusion.The analysis of the regional gap between Khoroo in each of Ulaanbaatar's six districts showed that the physical improvement of the Ger district, identified by the infrastructure supply rate, was not significant, and the physical gap between the Ger district and the city was still intact. Rather, due to the development of new towns, income and educational background gaps between new and existing cities with good location conditions were found in the form of new regional gaps. In addition, the regional gap between each Khoroo in Ulaanbaatar tends to widen from physical to social and economic aspects, such as the supply of infrastructure within the region, such as the educational background of local residents and average wage income. Ulaanbaatar's suburban development has not been achieved in the most needed Ger district, and has been driven by its economic feasibility, increasing the regional gap in Ulaanbaatar.The regional gap is feared to cause restrictions on citizens' social opportunities and consequent social conflicts. In order to ease regional gaps and achieve social integration that can develop into future social conflict factors, more research and housing policies are required for local and local residents."

North Korea and Cuba equated the historical background and significance of the Battle of Bocheonbo on June 4, 1937 and the July 26, 1953 invasion of Moncada Barracks. It was later defined that the Battle of Bocheonbo had a revolutionary effect on the Moncada barracks.North Korea and Cuba equated the legitimacy of the revolutionary spirit of the anti-Japanese armed struggle with the Sierra Maestra revolutionary spirit, the creation of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (April 25, 1932) and the attack on the Moncada barracks. This eventually developed into the logic that the Battle of Bochonbo and Kim Il-sung's anti-Japanese armed struggle contributed greatly to the revolutionary rise of the people under pressure from imperialism in the 1930s and 1940s.The efforts to unify the revolutionary tradition meant a trinity between the people, the party and the supreme leaders of the two countries, in other words, ""complete integration of national interests."

Methods: To develop TALE-K, a translation and back-translation procedure followed by an understanding test was performed. Then, a survey was conducted to examine the associations of AMF with psychosocial variables using TALE-K, Index of Well-Being (IWB), Meaning in Life Scale for older adults, Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, and Brief Resilience Scale. Results: Data from 75 community-dwelling older adults were used for the final analysis. The average scores of all three subscales of TALE-K were below 3 points (less frequent than occasionally). The correlation results showed that TALE-K total score was significantly associated with IWB and the Meaning in life scale for older adults. The multiple linear regression results presented that higher AMF was significantly associated with higher IWB, along with having siblings, higher meaning in life and resilience, and lower loneliness. Conclusion: Including a validation study of TALE-K, studies for understanding the characteristics of AMF in older adults using TALE-K are needed."

The separation principle began in Venice where bank was born, which means that the separation principle is one of the oldest principles that has lasted the most in banking regulation. In the early history of banks in the U.K. and U.S., the separation was adopted as a foundational principle. In Korea also, the separation has stood long since it was adopted in the Interim Measure Act for Financial Institutions of 1961 and Banking Act of 1982. Why the separation of banking and commerce? First, it concerns the bank soundness, systemic safety and depositor protection. Second, the regulatory scope in which the separation rule applies has been expanded from ‘banking in nature’ to ‘financial in nature’under the GLB Act in the U.S. Fourth, financial safety net such as deposit insurance includes securities firms, insurance, saving institution as well as banks. According to Mark Roe(1994), the separation principle has contributed to the competitiveness of firms and development of nation economy."
Validity and reliability of the Korean version of the Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale,2021,"['Smoking cessation', 'Validity and reliability', 'Translations']",,"Background/Aims: This study evaluated the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (WSWS-K) for use in clinical practice and research on Korean smokers.Methods: The Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale was translated into Korean and then back-translated into English. The authors reviewed the translation and back-translation and approved the final questionnaire draft. The validity and reliability of the WSWS-K were evaluated based on data collected from 300 participants. Construct validity was evaluated with a confirmatory factor analysis. Criterion-related validity was assessed by examining the relationships between the subscales of the WSWS-K and the matched items of the Korean version of the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS-K).Results: The participants were predominantly male (93.6%) and the mean age was 59.23 ± 15.19 years. The confirmatory factor analysis revealed that fit indices (namely, the goodness-of-fit index, adjusted goodness-of-fit index, comparative fit index, and the normed fit index) exceeded or approached 0.9. Cronbach’s alpha for the entire scale was 0.87. The total score of the WSWS-K had a statistically significant positive correlation with that of the MNWS-K (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, 0.768; p < 0.01). Additionally, we performed linear regression between the WSWS-K and MNWS-K scores after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidity, and smoking history. After this adjustment, the p value of the WSWS-K was < 0.001.Conclusions: The WSWS-K had satisfactory validity and reliability. The WSWS-K can be used with acceptable validity and reliability in research and clinical evaluation of Korean smokers."

The main value that can be delivered from the product to consumers is divided into experiential value and functional value. Movies and beauty products, automobiles and electronic products are selected as representative products for each values. As samples for an empirical analysis, Movie Lens 100k data and Amazon product data were employed. In order to solve the problem of a lazy large-scale data processing, the original data were reduced to about 20,000 each. RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) was used as a standard for comparing the predictive performance of the individual recommendation algorithms. As a result of the analysis, for products with important experiential values ​​such as movies and beauty products, the RMSE value of the item-based recommendation algorithm was higher than the RMSE value of the user-based recommendation algorithm, confirming the relative superiority of the user-based recommendation algorithm(Hypothesis 1 supported). On the other hand, for products with important functional values, such as automobiles and electronic products, the RMSE value of the item-based recommendation algorithm was lower than the RMSE value of the user-based recommendation algorithm, indicating that the item-based recommendation algorithm had relatively good predictive performance(hypothesis 2 supported). The main findings in this study make it clear that the predictive performance of the recommendation algorithm depends on the product attributes, unlike the absolute technical excellence of the individual recommendation algorithm shown in previous studies. Therefore, a company should seek to establish a marketing strategy and brand identity by using a recommendation algorithm suitable for product attributes."

This was because, according to Kuiji (窺基), Sautrāntika was the strongest critic of Yogācāra. While explaining the heretical theory of the Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi śāstra, various terms related to Sautrātika were also introduced. Some of these included Dārṣṭāntika, Sautrātika, pre-Sautrāntika (本經 部) and latter-Sautrāntika (末經部), root-Sautrāntika (根本經部), Sthavira and Sthavirapāṣika (上座部, Sthavira sect), root-Sthavirapāṣika (上座部根本師), as well as fundamental thoughts (本計) and derived thoughts (末計) of Sthavirapāṣika, all of which cannot be found in any other literature. It is of academic interest to un- cover where this information related to Sautrāntikas came from.These various terms related to Sautrāntika can be found in Samghabhadra's Abhidharmanyāyānusāra śāstra where their meaning can, at least to some extent, be understood. As such, it is reasonable to consider the information obtained on Sautrāntika originated here. Accordingly, Sautrāntika was proclaimed to be a sect of Sthavira (上座徒黨, 上座宗, Sthavira-pākṣika) by some proponents of Dārṣṭāntika and their Elder (Sthavira) Śrīlāta, as well as Saṃghabhadra. However, this opinion was not unanimous.The Abhidharmanyāyānusāra and Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi śāstras are closely related in that they are collections of materials from Sautrāntika research, which employs criticism with the same style of logic. This may have been why Xuanzang (⽞奘) learned the Nyāyānusāra śāstra through various routes during his trip to India, considering the purpose of his trip was to resolve suspicions about varying kinds of theories within Buddhism."

Methods For this purpose, nine students who participated in the practical class of table tennis major at K University were selected as research participants. Data such as research journals, unstructured in-depth interviews, and essays are collected. For data analysis, a narrative research method was used. Results First shows that the participants realized ‘lack of practical skills’, ‘lack of teaching skills’ and ‘deeply felt a lack of professionalism’ through the class experience. Also, they endeavor to ‘improving the ability to perform exercises’ based on ‘understanding how to play’ and ‘learning the ability to play’, and then ‘re-understood competitive activities’ in ‘class management aspects’ and ‘attitude development aspects.’ Second, the meaning of the class experience was ‘the role changed from a student to a physical education teacher’ as the preservice physical education teachers reflected that they should teach the students properly through the cultivation of the competence of the physical education teacher with both theory and practical skills. In addition, they ‘changed their perception of competitive activities’ as they realized that physical education was more important to foster the value of respect, consideration, and cooperation than education that resulted in antagonizing competition by emphasizing competition. Conclusions These results will help preservice physical education teachers to provide basic data on understanding the contents of sports classes through ‘table tennis practice and instruction method’ classes, and foster and practice teachers ability to transform individual students attitudes into positive behaviors in sports classes."

In the Buddhist epistemological tradition, Dharmakīrti (c. 600-660 C.E.) and Dharmottara (c. 750-810 C.E.) use this motif as an example to support their argument that misperception due to sensory error cannot be considered a valid means of cognition (prāmaṇa). Dharmakīrti provides this motif as an example of a cognition that is “free from conceptualization” (kalpanāpoḍham) but “mistaken” (bhrānta). Elaborating Dharmakīrti’s explanation,Dharmottra adds a new interpretation that seeing moving trees is not trustworthy since, in such a cognition, trees appear to stay in many different places. On the other hand, Śaṅkara (c. 700-750 C.E.) of Advaita Vedānta school employs the gacchadvṛkṣadarśana motif as a metaphor of elusive ātman, describing ātman as a seemingly moving tree.What we can observe from these two cases is that the commonly used themes such as passengers’ seeing moving trees can be shared by intellectuals of different affiliations but serve divergent purposes. While it was a simple example of erroneous cognition for Dharmakīrti, but Śaṅkara metaphorically uses the motif in his illustration of the fundamental ignorance (māyā) about the omnipresent ātman. In both cases, the basic idea of epistemological fallacy (vibhrama) immanent in the motif of seeing moving trees remains but the context in which it is put produces different significances.Collecting and analyzing more similar cases of shared ideas or common stock expressions such as this would enable us to rethink how the classical Indian intellectuals formulate their arguments, the theoretical interchanges between seemingly discrete schools, and the common ground on which they debated with each other."

Research design, data and methodology: ranking indicators, cluster analysis, K means method, correlation analysis. Results: The analysis covers data for 95 countries for 2019. The number of countries is justified by the availability of comparable data for calculations. A direct relationship between the indicators for the entire sample has been revealed in the result of the correlation analysis. However, this relationship has not been confirmed for the groups of countries that were formed through the cluster analysis. Spearman Rank Order and Kendall Tau Correlations have been calculated for the five obtained clusters. In two of the five clusters, the relationship between the indicators has not been found. A strong negative link between all the indicators has been detected in the cluster with average index values. A strong positive link between TTCI and BSI has been revealed in the group of countries with the best index values. A strong positive link between TTCI and HDI has been found in the group of countries with the worst index values. Conclusions: The analysis demonstrates that there is a relationship between BSI, TTCI and HDI, and while this link is observed for the sample as a whole, it is not homogeneous for groups of countries."

There were also significant differences in the most of the keratometric values of the posterior corneal surface (p < 0.05) except J0 (p = 0.410). Both devices showed strong positive correlations in steep K, flat K, astigmatism (r > 0.81, p < 0.001) with wide ranges of a 95% limit of agreement. Vectoral components were significantly correlated (r > 0.78, p < 0.001) with narrow 95% limit of agreement, except J45 of the posterior surface (r = 0.39, p = 0.004). In the corneal HOAs, there were statistically significant differences in the vertical coma, horizontal trefoil, spherical aberration, and root mean square of each fifth- and sixth-order Zernike coefficient (p = 0.043, p = 0.041, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Other HOAs showed moderate to strong positive correlations (r > 0.37, p < 0.05). Most HOAs, except for the horizontal trefoil, showed clinically acceptable agreements. The total root mean square of HOAs was not significantly different between the two devices (p = 0.122). Conclusions: Most of the keratometric values cannot be used interchangeably. However, the vectoral component of astigmatism showed clinically good agreement. Several HOAs have statistically significant differences; however, almost all HOAs showed acceptable agreements, except for the horizontal trefoil."

Filipino Teachers’ and Parents’ Perception on the Use of Mother Tongue Language in Science Classroom: Case of Baguio City,2021,"['MTB-MLE', 'mother tongue', 'Ilocano', 'Philippines', 'science class']",,"Science in the Philippines was previously taught in English but is now being delivered at the grade 3 level using Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) across the country to address the gaps in scientific literacy which are embedded in the K to 12 Curriculum. This study analyzed the perception of teachers and parents on the use of MTB-MLE in science classes in terms of language for learning and implementation, and the perception of teachers on its challenges and its use in science teaching. A modified survey questionnaire was adapted from Burton (2013), Filmore (2014) and Lualhati (2018) and was answered by 54 teachers and 96 parents of Grade 3 students from 6 public and private schools in Baguio City. Mean, standard deviation, ranking and t-test were employed for the statistical treatment of data using SPSS. It was revealed that teachers and parents strongly agreed on the use of MTB-MLE as language for learning and perceived their schools ready for its implementation. Lack of instructional materials in Ilocano ranked first among the perceived challenges by the teachers. The use of Ilocano in science classes was perceived by the teachers to enhance students’ academic performance but more preference was given to English as a medium of instruction. This sheds light that there is a misalignment in MTB-MLE policy and implementation. It also implies that parents’ and teachers’ perceptions are important in its implementation. It is recommended that further studies be conducted on the use of MTB-MLE in science classes across the country, and thus, may help policy makers, curriculum developers and stakeholders create a sound curriculum and materials in the context of MTB-MLE science teaching and learning."

It starts with a review of the Korean discourse upon the successful prevention of COVID-19 epidemics in 2020. In the author’s perspective, the success of so-called ‘K-prevention’ was caused by the unintended political balance among three different generations of Korean society. However, the balance already includes numerous symptoms of collapse that demands very strongly the justifiability of constitutional revision in a grand scale.Through an analysis of the two failures in constitutional revision during the President Moon Jae-In’s administration, the author insists a new approach that focuses on the combination of the revision of constitutional text and the reform of constitutional acts such as the organizational acts of National Assembly, political party, government, court, and etc. For the directions of constitutional revision, the author mainly proposes three big agendas: the design of spatial check & balance between the political powers, the re-structuring of legislative and executive powers, and the raising of system-relevance in the judicial process. This also means a kind of roadmap in the Korean constitutional politics to make a majority-alliance for the constitutional revision by the political compromise between the so-called living powers in Korean society."
A REPRESENTATION FOR AN INVERSE GENERALIZED FOURIER-FEYNMAN TRANSFORM ASSOCIATED WITH GAUSSIAN PROCESS ON FUNCTION SPACE,2021,,,"In this paper, we suggest a representation for an inverse transform of the generalized Fourier-Feynman transform on the function space C<sub>a;b</sub>[0; T]. The function space C<sub>a;b</sub>[0; T] is induced by the generalized Brownian motion process with mean function a(t) and variance function b(t). To do this, we study the generalized Fourier-Feynman transform associated with the Gaussian process Z<sub>k</sub> of exponential-type functionals. We then establish that a composition of the Z<sub>k</sub>-generalized Fourier-Feynman transforms acts like an inverse generalized Fourier-Feynman transform."
Validity and reliability of the Korean version of the Quality of Recovery-15 questionnaire,2021,"['Cross-cultural comparison', 'Health care', 'Health status', 'Quality assurance', 'Quality of life', 'Surveys and questionnaires', 'Translation.']",,"Background:  The qulity of recovery-40 questionnaire (QoR-40) has been widely used to assess quality of recovery after surgery, but it is too lengthy for clinical use. The short form of QoR-40, QoR-15, has been validated in many languages; however, an official Korean version of the QoR-15 (QoR-15K) has not yet been established. This study aimed to develop and validate QoR-15K.Methods:  Based on the previously-validated Korean QoR-40, we selected 15 items; the QoR-15K was patterned on the original QoR-15. We analyzed 210 subjects who had been scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. The patients completed the questionnaire before surgery and on postoperative days one and two. The validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the QoR-15K were evaluated. Results:  We obtained excellent convergent validity on visual analog scale for recovery (VAS) (ρ = 0.88, P < 0.001). The duration of anesthesia, post-anesthesia care unit, and overall hospital stay with the QoR-15K showed a significant negative correlation (ρ = -0.183, -0.151, and -0.185, respectively). Cronbach’s α was 0.909. Cohen’s effect size and standardized response mean were  0.819 and 0.721. The recruitment and completion rate were 92.9% and 100%, respectively. We based the above calculations on the results obtained on the first day following surgery.Conclusions:  The validity and reliability of the QoR-15K are comparable to those of the English version. The QoR-15K would be a good instrument to assess the quality of recovery in Korean patients after surgery."

This cross-sectional study aimed to assess dietary intake, micro-and macro-nutrients in the patients undergoing GBS and determine the possible associations with weight changes. We assessed anthropometric indices and food intake at 24 month-post gastric bypass surgery. Dietary data was evaluated using three-day food records. After the 24 months of surgery, among 35 patients (mean age: 43.5 ± 11.2 years; 82.85% females), with the mean body mass index (BMI) of 30.5 ± 4.5 kg/m2, 17 cases were < 50% of their excess weight. The average daily calorie intake was 1,733 ± 630 kcal, with 14.88% of calories from protein. Consumption amounts of protein (0.82 ± 0.27 g/kg of the current weight), as well as fiber, and some micro-nutrients (vitamin B9, E, K, B5, and D3) were lower than recommended amounts. Patients were classified into three groups based on their success in weight loss after surgery. Calorie intake was not significantly different between groups, but successful groups consumed considerably more protein and less carbohydrate than the unsuccessful group (p < 0.05). Based on our findings, the patients undergoing GBS had inadequate macro- and micro-nutrient intake after 24 months. However, protein intake can affect patients' success in achieving better weight loss. Long-term cohort and clinical studies need to be conducted to comprehend this process further."

The differences in drinking motivation, drinking refusal self-efficacy, and problematic drinking behaviors were statistically significant for the group by time interaction (F = 42.56, p < .001; F = 54.96, p < .001; F = 39.90, p < .001, respectively). Conclusion: The findings indicate that the intervention effectively decreases drinking motivation, increases drinking refusal self-efficacy, and decreases problematic drinking behaviors. It can be an efficient strategy for college students with problematic drinking habits to enhance their self-determination ability."
Color Inconstancy of Chromatic and Achromatic Textile Fabrics with Changes in the Correlated Color Temperature and Luminance of the Light Source,2021,"['Color appearance', 'Correlated color temperature', 'Luminance', 'Light source', 'Illuminant metamerism']",,"This study quantitatively analyzed how the color appearance of textile fabrics of varying lightness, chroma, andhue changes under a broad spectrum of illumination conditions. The color appearances of 203 chromatic (R, YR, Y, GY, G,BG, B, and RB) and achromatic fabrics were measured spectroradiometrically under 16 light sources with different correlatedcolor temperatures (2700, 4000, 5000, and 6500 K) and luminances (50, 100, 500, and 1000 cd/m2). The color appearancevalues were compared with the spectrophotometrically measured physical color values of the fabrics, which were regarded astheir true colors. The differences ranged up to 12.45 |ΔL*10|, 19.32 |ΔC*ab,10|, 161.83 |Δhab,10|, and 16.70 ΔECMC(2:1) units, whichwere significantly higher than the color discrimination thresholds of the human eye. Among 9 hue groups of fabrics, the colorappearances of BG (bluish-green) fabrics were generally most affected by light sources, while those of achromatic fabricswere least affected with mean ΔECMC(2:1) of 6.32 and 1.03, respectively. It was also found that the correlated color temperatureof light sources significantly affected all the lightness, colorfulness, and hue of fabrics, and the different trends of these effectswere observed for different hue groups. Unlike current knowledge, light sources with a correlated color temperature of6500 K did not always produce color appearances that most closely resemble the actual physical colors. Meanwhile, theluminance of light sources did not have a profound effect on the color appearances of fabrics."
Determination of total nitrogen content in fresh leaves and leaf powder of Dendrobium orchids using near-infrared spectroscopy,2021,['Dendrobium · External validation · Fertilizer · Leaf powder · Near-infrared spectroscopy · Nitrogen'],,"Appropriate application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer promotes plant growth, infl orescence yield, and fl ower quality of orchids.In this study, we used the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique to develop a prediction model of the N content inthe leaf of Dendrobium orchid, which is an essential indicator for monitoring plant health. The Dendrobium orchid sampleswere foliar sprayed in rotation between 20N–20P–20K and 30N–10P–10K fertilizers at a frequency of once or twice a weekto create a diverse amount of leaf N content. An application of water was used as the control treatment. After nine monthsof fertilizer treatments, 150 fresh orchid leaf samples, containing various N contents, were scanned using Fourier-transformnear-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS). Then the samples were dried and ground to a fi ne powder and were again scanned.The absorbance spectra were collected at the 12,000–4000 cm −1 (800–2500 nm) region. Total N content was determined byusing the combustion method. The result showed a high profi ciency in the estimation of N in leaf powder with the correlationcoeffi cient of prediction (R p ), the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), and the ratio of standard deviation ofreference data of prediction set to standard error of prediction (RPD) being 0.9882, 0.0637% dry weight (DW), and 6.53,respectively. The fresh leaf sample was successfully predicted with R p , RMSEP, and RPD of 0.8874, 0.207% DW, and 2.13,respectively. Additionally, external validation confi rmed the high reliability of using leaf powder since the correlation coefficient of external validation (r p ) and RMSEP of the external validation achieved 0.9651 and 0.1405% DW, respectively,while the external validation of fresh leaf should be improved with r p = 0.7438 and RMSEP = 0.2652% DW. The overallresults suggested that NIRS can be used for monitoring the N status in orchids, especially in leaf powder, with high accuracy"

『능가경』의 불신관(佛身觀)에 대한 고찰 - 유가행 유식학파와의 상관성을 중심으로 -,2021,"['능가경', '楞伽經', '불신관', '佛身觀', '자성신', '自性身', '수용신', '受用身', '변화신', '變化身', 'Lengjia jing', 'buddha-body view', 'self-natured body', 'reward body', 'transformation-body']",,"This research essay aims to investigate the buddha - body view of the Lengjia jing, focusing on its correlation with that of the Yogâcāra School of Indian Buddhism. It seems that there is no previous study on this topic. The Lengjia jing is a sutra in Chinese which is still debated as to whether it was compiled before Vasubandhu or after Vasubandhu.According to the Yogâcāra school’s major treatises such as the Dasheng zhuangyanjing lun (Mahāyāna - sūtrâlaṃkāra), the She dasheng lun (Mahāyāna - saṃgraha - śāstra), the Cheng weishi lun (Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi - śāstra), the She dashenglun shi (Mahāyāna - saṃgraha - bhāṣya), and the Fodi lun (Buddhabhūmisūtra - śāstra), the school’s buddha - body view is as follows. The self - natured body, serving as the supporting basis that both the reward body and the transformation - body rely on, means the dharma - body of self nature, namely the nondiscriminatory, true, and inherent nature of all things. The enjoyment body is manifested in two separate forms: one is the ‘self enjoyment’(a buddha’s enjoyment of his own enlightenment) indicating the aspect of self - benefit and the other is the ‘other enjoyment’(buddha’s extention of enjoyment to bodhisattvas) indicating the aspect of benefiting others.The enjoyment body means the reward - body buddha, and the transformation body is a buddha incarnated in a human body for the purpose of saving the two kinds of practitioners (śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas) and the unenlightened ordinary persons. The Yogâcāra school’s view of the buddha - body focuses on the enjoyment body that indicates the buddha - body of self - benefit and other - benefit.But, on the other side, the Lengjia jing states that the dharma - body saves sentient beings by directly manifesting itself in the form of radiance through the reward body and the transformation body. In this buddha - body view, the dharma - body is described as the active element of salvation. For this reason, this buddha - body view can be said to place emphasis on the dharma body. Yet the buddha - body views of the Lengjia jing and the Yogâcāra school correspond to each other in many ways. Also the Lengjia jing and the Yogâcāra school use the same name when they describe the buddha - body in their verses."
Formation and characterization of MoSe2 interfacial layer in flexible CIGS thin film solar cells,2021,['MoSe2 · CIGS thin film solar cells · Back contact'],,"In this study, we prepared MoSe2 layers and varied their thicknesses to observe the formation behavior at different selenization temperatures and the impact on the I–V characteristics of copper indium gallium selenide thin film solar cells. Field emission scanning electron microscopy was used to measure the cross-sectional thickness of the MoSe2 film, and X-ray diffraction to identify its structure. In addition, the temperature-dependent open-circuit voltage (Voc) was measured at temperatures from 80 to 300 K to analyze the recombination at the back contact. We found that with increasing the thickness of MoSe2, the photovoltaic performances of the devices decreased and that a thicker MoSe2 meant a higher electrical resistivity of the devices. In addition, the external quantum efficiency show a reduction in carrier collection, short-circuit current, at wavelengths beyond 700 nm, which implies a high recombination at the back contact. Furthermore, the measurement of the temperature-dependent Voc showed that the activation energy (EA) of the best cell was less than the bandgap of the device, which corresponds to drop in the value of the Voc and the fill factor. Our study showed that at a MoSe2 thickness of about 80 nm, the device showed highest efficiency."
Applicability of Conventionally Recommended Fertilizer Rates for Potato Cultivated in Saemangeum Reclaimed Land in the Fall Season,2021,"['Fertilization rate', 'Potato', 'Reclaimed land', 'Saemangeum', 'Soil test']",,"It is important to increase the area of potato cultivation in the fall season for a stable year-round supply system in Korea. Saemangeum reclaimed land has the potential to extension of potato cultivation area with appropriate practices. This study was performed to test applicability of fertilizer recommendation in southern coastal area to the Saemangeum area. Two experiments were conducted: one experiment compared the yield response of potato between standard rates of N-P-K (SR) and recommendation rates of N-P-K based on soil test (STR) and the other experiment analyzed yield response to 4 different levels of N, P, K, respectively. The potato yield in SR was 6.05 Mg ha<SUP>-1</SUP> on average and varied from 1.68 Mg ha<SUP>-1</SUP> to 11.80 Mg ha<SUP>-1</SUP>. The potato yield in STR, meanwhile, ranged from 8.13 Mg ha<SUP>-1</SUP> to 12.17 Mg ha<SUP>-1</SUP> with a mean value of 9.65 Mg ha<SUP>-1</SUP>. Potato yield was increased linearly with N fertilization rates but P and K fertilization did not have any significant effect on potato growth. The N fertilization rate (NFR) and the soil available phosphate content (Av. P₂O5) had significant positive corelation with potato yield (p < 0.01). Based on stepwise multiple regression analysis, partial regression coefficient was 0.30 for NFR and 0.08 for Av. P₂O5; Y = 19.6 X₁ + 34.9 X₂ + 1,410, where Y, X₁, and X₂ mean potato yield, NFR, and Av. P₂O5, respectively. Conclusively, STR was strongly recommended for potato in the Saemangeum reclaimed land and the conventional standard fertilization rate was hardly applicable to the area, especially for nitrogen."
Experimental and modeling studies for intensification of mercaptans extraction from LSRN using a microfluidic system,2021,"['Microchannel', 'Mercaptan Extraction', 'Light Straight-run Naphtha', 'Genetic Algorithm', 'Optimization', 'RSM', 'ANN']",,"We investigated the performance of a T-type microchannel for mercaptan extraction from light straightrun naphtha (LSRN) with sodium hydroxide solution. The aim of this work is to introduce the microfluidic system as a potential tool for mercaptan extraction from light petroleum products. Modeling the extraction process of mercaptan from LSRN has not been carried out previously. In this regard, mercaptan extraction was modeled by response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) to analyze the effect of operating parameters on the mercaptan extraction process. The independent variables are considered as temperature, sodium hydroxide concentration, and the volume ratio of sodium hydroxide to LSRN. Two models were compared based on error analysis of the predicted data. Root mean square error, mean relative error, and determination coefficient for the neural network were 0.5650, 0.4341, and 0.9862, respectively. The values of these parameters for the RSM model were 0.6854, 0.7648, and 0.9798.The results showed that the prediction accuracy for both models is appropriate, but the precision of the neural network model is slightly higher than that of the RSM model. The genetic algorithm (GA) technique determined the optimal values of the independent variables with the aim of maximizing the extraction percentage. The mercaptan extraction percentage value of 85.08% was achieved at 303.15 K, the sodium hydroxide concentration of 20 wt%, and the volume ratio of sodium hydroxide to LSRN of 0.128. Furthermore, results showed a higher mercaptan extraction percentage of the microfluidic system compared to a conventional extractor at the same process condition."
유엔해양법협약상 해양환경소송사건을 통해 본 일본의 원전 오염수 방류 문제 - 청구취지 구성 등 소제기시 시사점을 중심으로 -,2021,"['오염수', '분쟁해결절차', '해양환경보호', '해양환경소송사건', '유엔해양법협약', 'contaminated water', 'dispute settlement procedure', 'marine environmental protection', 'marine environmental litigation cases', 'United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea', 'UNCLOS']",,"This article explores the litigation cases regarding the marine environmental protection under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In addition, an effort is made to suggest Korea’s possible arguments and draw the policy implications when Korea refers the issue of Japan’s radioactive contaminated water discharge to an arbitral tribunal in accordance with the UNCLOS Annex Ⅶ. Until now, the Annex Ⅶ tribunals have dealt with the violation of the marine environmental protection obligation in the following cases: the MOX Plant (Ireland v. U.K.) case, the Land Reclamation (Malaysia v. Singapore) case, the Chagos Marine Protected Area (Mauritius v. U.K.) case, the South China Sea (The Philippines v. China) case, and the Coastal State Rights (Ukraine v. Russia) case. Of these cases, the South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal rendered the award on the merits with regard to the substantive violation of the marine environmental protection obligations under the UNCLOS Part XII. Furthermore, the noteworthy provisional measures orders were made in the MOX Plant case, and the Land Reclamation case by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). Theoretically, the marine environmental litigation cases have the feature that it is relatively easy to reach the decision on the merits beyond the jurisdictional stage. This is because the spatial scope of application of the marine environmental protection obligations is wide and there is no jurisdictional limitation set by the Section Ⅲ of the UNCLOS Part XV. However, in the substantive aspects, there exists a degree of uncertainty in terms of the contents and scopes of the marine environmental protection obligations under the UNCLOS Part XII. Thus, it is rather difficult to clearly judge a violation of such obligations, and furthermore, the supplementation by other international rules and standards may be necessary. The role of the experts of the specific field is also regarded as important. Despite such limitations, given the claimants’ submissions in the previous litigation cases and the conclusions made by the tribunals thereof, Korea can invoke the following obligations under the UNCLOS Part XII against Japan with regard to the contaminated water release: the obligation of measures to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment, the obligation of cooperation, and the obligation of the environmental impact assessment. In principle, Korea is also able to request for provisional measures to the ITLOS or the Annex Ⅶ tribunal. However, in order to draw more meaningful decision, it is paramount for Korea to prove the marine environmental pollution based on the scientific evidence according to the objective international standards, and to effectively present such arguments in the proceedings. In addition, considering the risks associated with filing a lawsuit, it is reasonable to fully consider the possibility of resolving the issue by the means other than litigation under the fundamental consideration of policy goals."

Several India news media mentioned this accident cold be similar with M.C. Mehta case and could be applicable for the Rule of Absolute Liability. Because the Rule of Absolute Liability is a completely new concept to us, it is necessary to introduce both Rule of Strict Liability in U.K. and Rule of Absolute Liability in India that are not familiar to the civil law system.In order to satisfy The Rule of Strict Liability, it requires that the defendant must collect or keep an exceptionally dangerous this on his or her land. The defendant’s use of land must be non-natural and extraordinary compared with the circumstance of time and place around the defendant’s property. The dangerous thing must escape from defendant’s property. And, in the Rule of Strict Liability from Rylands v. Fletcher, it provides the possible defences as exceptions of application of this rule, such as Plaintiff’s own default or consent, Act of God, Act of third party, and Statutory authority.The rule of Strict Liability from Rylands v. Fletcher could not be a same meaning of the No-fault liability theory. It might be overlapped in some portion but not contain the equal value or concept in laws of Tort. In U.K and India, in order to provide the rule of No-fault Liability, it is required to enact several different types of laws, such as Workermen’s Compensation and Motor Vehicles Act.There were two tragic gas leakage accidents in India, called as Bhopal gas leaking accident in 1984 and M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (1987) in which the accident was occurred in Delhi in 1985. In these accidents, the poor who were in lower levels of Cast system had mainly suffered from them. In this regards, the India judiciary recognized the need of social safety-net and protection from the ‘hazardous and inherently dangerous activities.’the rule of Absolute Liability exceptionally provides the notion of ‘Mass Tort’ and cover the ‘public interest’ engaged in the activity for private profit."
Hand Grip and Leg Muscle Strength in Hemodialysis Patients and Its Determinants,2021,"['Hand Grip Strength', 'Hemodialysis', 'Leg Muscle Strength']",,"Background: Chronic kidney disease is associated with chronic inflammation and progressive loss of peripheral muscle strength and the ability to exercise, and these changes are highly pronounced in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD). We evaluated hand grip strength (HGS) and leg muscle strength (LMS) in patients receiving HD and attempted to identify factors associated with muscle strength.Methods: We screened HGS (opposite the fistula side) and LMS (both sides) in HD patients at a single center (n = 112) by using digital hand and leg dynamometers (T.K.K. 5401 and 5710e/5715, Takei Scientific Instruments Co. Ltd., Niigata, Japan).Results: The mean age of patients was 62.6 years, and 73.2% of the patients were male. Diabetes was the cause of kidney failure in 50% of the patients, and the median HD vintage was 34 months. A total of 77.7% of patients reported that they participated in regular home-based exercise, and 29.5% of patients regularly participated in hospital-based resistance exercise. HGS and LMS showed good correlation (r = 0.715, P < 0.001). HGS (25.1 vs. 17.0 kg) and LMS (30.1 vs. 20.4 kg) were greater in males (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) than in females. Older patients (≥ 60 years) showed less LMS than younger patients in both males and females (P = 0.012 and P = 0.037, respectively), but HGS did not differ according to age. Patients performing regular home- or hospital-based exercise showed higher HGS than those who did not exercise (24.2 vs. 18.6 kg, P = 0.011), but LMS was not significantly different (29.3 vs. 23.6 kg, P = 0.185). Multiple linear regression analysis proved that male sex, younger age, and any type of exercise were factors associated with improved HGS and LMS. Groups of older age (≥ 60 years), male sex, and shorter duration of HD (< median) benefitted more from exercise.Conclusion: Sex, age, and exercise were the most important determinants of muscle strength in HD patients. We need to encourage patients to engage in regular home or group exercise from the beginning of dialysis and introduce new feasible forms of exercise for HD patients."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HPP for MCI.Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-center clinical trial. Eligible patients were randomly allocated to either the HPP group or the placebo group. HPP or saline as placebo was administered to participants for eight weeks. Changes in symptoms were observed. The primary outcome was difference in mean change of Korean Version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-K) score between the HPP group and the placebo group. Cognitive function, overall status of mood and sleep, and quality of life (QoL) were also assessed. Safety assessment and economic analysis were then conducted.Results: Thirty participants were enrolled. One participant in the placebo group dropped out. The score of MoCA-K increased after treatment. Its mean change was smaller in the HPP group than in the control group. HPP ameliorated Global Deterioration Scale and Korean Dementia Rating Scale subtests for attention, organization, and memory compared to the placebo. However, none of them was significantly different between the two groups. Mood, sleep, and QoL all improved more in the HPP group than in the placebo group, although differences between the two groups were not statistically significant.

진단되지 않은 근육병 환자를 대상으로 시행한 늦은 발병 폼페병의 다기관 표적집단선별검사,2021,"['Glycogen storage disease type II', 'Alpha-glucosidases', 'Enzyme assays', 'Genetic testing']",,"Background: Pompe disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme, acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment with enzyme replacement therapy have remarkable effects on the prognosis of Pompe disease. We performed the expanded screening for late onset Pompe disease (LOPD) at eight centers in Korea.Methods: From September 1, 2015, GAA activity were measured from both dried blood spot (DBS) and mixed leukocyte for 188 available patients. For 12 patients with low GAA activity, we performed Sanger sequencing of GAA gene.Results: Among 188 patients, 115 were males. The mean of age of symptom onset and diagnosis were 34.3 years and 41.6 years. Among 12 patients with decreased GAA activity, two patients were confirmed to have LOPD with genetic test (c.1316T>A [p.M439K] + c.2015G>A [p.R672Q], c.1857C>G [p.S619R] + c.546G>C [leaky splicing]). Other two patients had homozygous G576S and E689K mutation, known as pseudodeficiency allele.Conclusions: This study is expanded study of LOPD screening for targeted Korean population. We found two patients with LOPD, and the detection rate of LOPD is 1.06%. With application of modified GAA cutoff value (0.4), which was previously reported, there were no false positive results of GAA activity test using DBS. Therefore, it could be an appropriate screening test for LOPD in especially East-Asian population, in which pseudodeficiency allele is frequent."
Clinicopathological features and post-resection outcomes of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver,2021,"['Abscess', 'Inflammation', 'Liver mass', 'Benign disease', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma']",,"Backgrounds/Aims: Hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor (HIPT) is a rare disease characterized by chronic infiltration of inflammatory cells and area of fibrosis. The objective of this retrospective observational study was to investigate clinicopathological features and outcomes of patients who underwent hepatic resection (HR) for HIPT. Methods: From 2009 to 2018, seven patients with HIPT underwent HR, accounting for 0.06% of 11,979 adults who underwent HR at our center. Results: These seven patients included five men and two women. Their mean age was 62.3±11.6 years. In four patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, liver masses were suspected of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or combined HCC-cholangiocarcinoma based on imaging studies. In three patients without HBV infection, two patients were suspected of HCC, for whom liver biopsy was not performed. One patient was suspected of liver abscess or HIPT, for whom percutaneous liver biopsy was performed and the mass was diagnosed with HIPT. However, this patient underwent HR owing to abdominal pain. No patient presented with abnormally elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II, or CA19-9. During a mean follow-up period of 76.4±34.8 months, no patient experienced recurrence of HIPT. Conclusions: HIPT, a rare form of liver disease, is often misdiagnosed as malignant liver tumor. Active histological diagnosis is warranted for patients with suspected HIPT to avoid unnecessary operation. HR can be indicated in case of diagnostic ambiguity of HIPT or under a clinical diagnosis of malignant liver tumor."
"Changes in Soil Chemical Properties of Rice Paddy, Upland Field, and Greenhouse in Incheon from 2015 to 2019",2021,"['Chemical property', 'Greenhouse', 'Principal component analysis', 'Rice paddy field', 'Upland field']",,"This study was performed with the monitoring data of soil chemical properties of rice paddy, upland field and greenhouse soils in Ganghwa, Incheon metropolitan city from 2015 to 2019. Soil pH values tended to increase gradually in three soils, but there was no significant change in that of greenhouse soil. The concentration of organic matter (OM) and available phosphate (Av. P₂O₅) have fluctuated from 2015 to 2019, showing significant differences. In 2019, the average value of OM and Av. P₂O₅ were distributed within the appropriate level suggested by Rural Development Administration. In rice paddy field, the available silicate (SiO₂) were found to be proper within the standard concentration every year. The contents of exchangeable cations were higher than the proper standard, showing significant differences among the years, except greenhouse soil. The mean concentration of EC for five years in upland and greenhouse soils were 2.5 and 5.9 dS m<SUP>-1</SUP> above the proper standard. The optimal frequencies of pH were 46.8% and 47.1% at rice paddy and upland soil, but the excessive frequency ratio of pH was 48.5% at greenhouse soil in 2019. The exchangeable cations seemed to be seriously disproportionate exceeding the optimal level by 95%. In Pearson correlation matrix, the value of exchangeable Ca had a significantly positive correlation with exchangeable Mg content at upland and greenhouse soils. By principal component analysis, the exchangeable K, Mg and OM could distinguish between greenhouse and other soils on the first principal component and the pH and Av. P₂O₅ could differentiate between rice paddy and upland soils on the second principal component."

We observed the changes that occurred at rest and immediately after a marathon and triathlon.  Method: The subjects of the study were 8 amateur male marathon runners and 9 amateur triathletes. All participants were in their 30’s and 40’s of age and resided in the city of S. After the marathon runners ran a full race of 42.195 kilometers, two blood samples were taken immediately after the race when their conditions were stable. After the triathletes went through an Olympic course which included 1.5 kilometers of swimming, 40 kilometers of cycling, and 10 kilometers of running, two blood samples were also taken immediately after completion when their conditions were stable. Using the SPSS/PC+Ver. 21.0K program, descriptive statistics (Mean ± Standard Error) of all dependent variables were calculated. A two-way repeated ANOVA was performed to verify the difference between the average of the dependent variables once the homogeneity between the two groups (marathon and triathlon) and between thew to tests (stable and immediately after the race) were confirmed. A paired t-test was performed for the differences of the two tests within the groups, and an independent t-test was performed for the differences between the two groups. The statistical significance level was set to α=.05.  Results: In the marathon group, SOD significantly increased immediately after the race (p<.001). In the triathlon group, SOD significantly increased in the same manner after the race (p<.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups. In both groups, CK and LDHi significantly increased immediately after the races (p<.001), with no significant differences between the groups.  Conclusion: During long-term high-intensity aerobic exercise, marathons and triathlons increase oxidative stress, which can lead to muscle damage. Additionally, the increase of SOD, an antioxidant defense system enzyme, is a response to oxidative stress and appears to prevent the generation of free radicals from exercise."
"Palynology, mineralogy and geochemistry of sediments in Tondè locality, northern part of Douala sub-basin, Cameroon, Central Africa: implication on paleoenvironment",2021,"['Douala sub-basin', 'Pleistocene–Holocene age deposits', 'equatorial climate', 'pyrite occurrences', 'clay minerals', 'Cameroon']",,"A multi-proxy study, including mineralogy, whole rock geochemistry and palynology analyses, was conducted on 79 samples (64 bulk sediment and 10 pyrite samples) from two sites (ES and DA) located in the Tondè area, Douala sub-basin (Cameroon) to unravel the paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions prevailing in recent continental deposits. Lithologies of this locality mainly consist of pyriteous claystones (grey and red) and unconsolided sandstones. Encountered pyrite is euhedral (isolated and clusters crystals) and massive with diverse morphologies and sizes. In both sections, major and trace elements show that the clayey materials result from weathering of an intermediate source rock, probably from the surrounding basement (gneiss and micaschist), whereas the sandy materials appear to be recycled. Palynological data consists of a few index species such as Malvaceae and graminaceae which indicate Pleistocene–Holocene age deposits of continental origin (swampy bays of seaside and hinterland). This area was subjected to intense chemical alteration (high CIA values: 97.35–99.43%) as testified by the mineralogical phases, mainly consist of kaolinite, quartz and goethite. Mean annual precipitation (MAP = 221.1e0.0197(CIA-K); ±181 mm.y–1) and mean annual temperature (MAT = 46.9C + 4; ±0.6 °C) are 1575 ± 181 mm.y–1 and 25.2 ± 0.6 °C for ES site and then 1566 ± 181 mm.y–1 and 20.3 ± 0.6 °C for DA, thus reflecting a subequatorial to equatorial climate. The pyrite geochemistry is characterized by a weak Al vs. ΣREE positive correlation (r2 = 0.02), a positive Eu anomaly relative to PAAS and a significant negative correlation between ΣREE and the Eu anomaly (r2 = –0.83). These results indicate that pyrite is a late diagenesis product formed by a secondary enrichment and coupled with precipitation under more reducing conditions, linked to the water table fluctuation."

The Fourth Industrial Revolution aims to create innovative new science and technology through convergence between science, industry and technology beyond the scope of individual science, technology, and industries. However, in order to drive and support this Fourth Industrial Revolution, innovation can be promoted only when technical regulations are removed or eased. Currently, Korea's laws and policies prevent convergence between science, industry and technology, which are the premise of the fourth industrial revolution.Therefore, deregulation or relaxation should be the premise for the Fourth Industrial Revolution more effectively, and deregulation is generally referred to as regulatory reform, which means reducing the number of regulations, improving the quality of regulations, and simplifying procedures.The regulatory sandbox system seeks to re-examine or change existing regulations to socially realize these new technologies or business models if they are difficult to create new business models because of regulations such as the practicality of new technologies or new business models.Since its introduction in the UK in 2016, the regulatory sandbox system has been implemented mainly in the financial advanced countries, including Singapore, but has been recognized as a whole of the Fourth Industrial Revolution as it has been applied to high-tech industrial technologies such as ICT, AI (Artificial Intelligence), robots, and autonomous driving.In Korea, however, the financial sector is different from that of the U.K., which introduced the first regulatory sandbox in the U.K., where regulatory sandboxes can be applied to establish regional special zones where information and communication technology (ICT), AI (Artificial Intelligence), robots, autonomous driving, and industries.By 2019, Korea's regulatory sandboxes were approved 79 cases in the ICT and convergence sectors, 77 cases in the financial sector, and 39 cases in the local innovation sector were approved.In this paper, the goal of this study is to review the legislation and status of regulatory sandboxes in Korea, and then introduce the regulatory sandbox system in Japan to draw suggestions through comparative legal research with Korea and present policies, legislation, and institutional improvements to Korea."
Study of Battery State-of-charge Estimation with kNN Machine Learning Method,2021,"['Electrical vehicle', 'Battery characteristics', 'State of charge', 'Depth of discharge', 'Machine learning algorithms and kNN method']",,"Electric vehicles have high demand due to their ecofriendly nature. From this point of view, lithium batteries have gained high attention in recent days due to their high efficiency and long life time. Hence, it is of the utmost importance to evaluate the battery characteristics, such as the state of charge (SOC), depth of discharge (DOD), and remaining life of a battery to ensure battery safety. These parameters were derived in order to estimate the battery life time before degradation. This estimation is very much required in making a decision about battery usage in the future. In this study, the SOC of a lithium polymer battery was evaluated in a real-time experiment. Charging and discharging cycles were done, and we obtained the voltage, current, and time data from the experimental result. This experimental data trained machine learning methods such as the kNN (k Nearest Neighbor) method to estimate the SOC more precisely. After training the model, a test was done. The proposed estimator was calibrated by experimental data. The results are satisfactory with accuracy of 98% and mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 0.74[%]."

A Novel Time Step Fusion Method with Finite Volume Formulation for Accelerated Thermal Analysis of Laser Additive Manufacturing,2021,['Time fusion · Finite volume method · Laser additive manufacturing · Thermal analysis'],,"Laser additive manufacturing has been regarded as a typical green manufacturing process. This paper presents a novel numerical approach termed time step fusion (TSF) along with the finite volume method (FVM), for fast computing the temperature field in a predominant laser additive manufacturing process, namely, selective laser melting. The solution acceleration strategy using TSF is that the entire computational domain is partitioned into multiple subdomains, and in the subdomain distant from the laser source and with the milder thermal gradients, larger time steps are employed. A thin wall is simulated to verify the proposed TSF method and evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency. The results are compared with those of the standard FVM model without TSF. It shows that they are in good agreement in terms of the spatiotemporal thermal profiles. The mean absolute error for the case studies with TSF is below 1 K except for a few spikes of the discrepancy reaching up to 15 K in the molten pool. Meanwhile, up to 28% acceleration in computational speed is obtained with TSF-FVM compared with regular FVM, and 93% time saving is achieved compared with a benchmark FEM model with a commercial solver. An extended case study is also presented to further verify the applicability of the proposed approach for complex geometries. The factors that contribute to the speed are analyzed, and the strategies for potential further improvement are also discussed."

At the beginning, geothermal silica preparation was subjected to the purification of geothermal silica waste using sulfuric acid, sol-gel process, and drying process at ambient pressure.This research was statistically carried out by varying the volume ratio of HCl to sodium silicate (3-5), drying time (1-2 hours), and percent weight of silica (3-5%-w) using Design-Expert® Version 8.0.6 (State-Ease, Inc). The silica product was characterized through BET, FTIR, XRF, and XRD analysis. Analysis of untreated and treated biodiesel used GPC, GCMS, and titration based on Indonesian National Standard (SNI) of No. 06-1564-1995. The optimum conditions for preparation for removing glycerin in biodiesel was reached at ratio volume of HCl to sodium silicate of 3 : 1, 2 hours of drying time, and 3%-w silica adsorbent. The optimum of surface area of the s ilica adsorbent and the glycerin adsorption capacity can be attained at 371m2/g glycerin and 10±0.1 mg/g, respectively.

These transcripts show that the morpheme “-ko” is the default ending in embedded constructions as in Standard Korean.  This paper discusses the eight environments in which “-ko” is embedded. The first is quotations. The ending is found in a fully conjugated verb form of embedded clauses. There are two types of lead verbs that permit embedding, each of which has two subcategories. The first type is that which is found in quotations and in statements about the speaker’s mental state as well. The second is that which expresses willingness to do an action and that which expresses the current state of reality.  When the amalgamated “-kon” is embedded, it becomes either truncated “-ko” or the noun-modifying ending “-un” (or “-n”, reduced by re-syllabication), both of which are freely substituted with no meaning alternation at all. This fact suggests that the connective ending ‘-kok’ can also be analyzed as fused form. Some believe that the same “-ko” ending and a nominal suffix “-uk” (or “-k”, reduced by resyllabication) are amalgamated in the sense that it allows interchangeability with “-ko” in any circumstances.  As a result, the same form “-ko” is observed in both environments: embedding and conjunction. If this sort of reduction holds, from “-kok” to “-ko” as much as from “-kon” to “-ko”, then it implies they share the same functional category. It was claimed that they shared the same modality in J. H. Kim(2020, p. 381 and p.774), only if modality was widely defined as a judgment about possible events."
김억의 초기 에스페란토 번(중)역의 함의,2021,"['김억', '에스페란토', '번역', '중역', '세계문학', 'Kim Eok', 'esperanto', 'translation', 'double translation', 'world literature']","김억은 1916년 에스페란토를 습득한 후 1919년부터는 에스페란토 시를 번역했고, 1921년부터는 에스페란토 관련 논설을 본격적으로 발표했다. 이 과정에서 김억은 프랑스어와 영어 학습, 그 문학의 수용에 대한 절망을 드러내는 한편으로, 에스페란토 문학 대 자국어문학이라는 다른 세계문학의 비전을 제시하기도 했다. 특히 김억의 에스페란토 시 창작과 번역이란 프랑스·영국을 중심으로 한 서유럽의 세계문학을 상대화하는 일이자, 그것을 초월하는 다른 세계문학의 공간에 참여하는 일이기도 했다. 그러나 김억은 에로셴코의 시를 번역하면서 일본어 대역문까지 저본으로 삼아 중역할 수밖에 없었다. 또 당시 조선어와 에스페란토란 일본어, 심지어 영어까지 매개로 한 복잡한 중역의 관계에 놓여 있었다. 더욱이 김억에게 에스페란토 시 번역이든, 창작이든 제국 일본의 에스페란티스토들을 경유하지 않고서는 불가능했다. 그러나 김억은 이러한 사정을 인식하지 못했고, 『오뇌의 무도』(1921) 발표 직후에는 그것이 일본어 번역시로부터의 중역임을 은폐하기 위해 에스페란토와 그 문학을 알리바이로 삼기도 했다. 그것은 김억이 프랑스와 영국을 중심으로 한 세계문학의 중심과의 동시성, 그 중심을 향한 욕망을 부상하는 인공어 에스페란토와 실험적 문학에 투사하고 있었음을 드러낸다.","Kim Eok studied Esperanto in Tokyo, Japan in 1916, translated poems written in Esperanto in 1919, and published his editorials about Esperanto in full scale in 1921. In this process, he displayed his despair with his study of French and English and acceptance of French and English literature and proposed a vision of world literature, Esperanto literature vs. vernacular literature. For him, the creation and translation of poems in Esperanto were to relativize the world literature of Western Europe around France and the U.K. and participate in the space of other world literature that transcended it. Translating poems of Vasili Eroshenko, however, he was forced into double translation based on the original scripts of their translations in Japanese. In those days, there were complicated double translation relations between Korean and Esperanto via Japanese and even English. Moreover, it was impossible for him to translate or create Esperanto poems without resorting to the Esperantisto of Imperial Japan. However, he had no idea of this situation. He even used Esperanto as his alibi to cover up the fact that his The Dance of Agony was an outcome of his double translation of Japanese versions. This means that he projected himself onto the central and simultaneous nature of world literature including France and the U.K., the artificial language Esperanto as his desire emerging toward the center, and its experimental literature."

The product cost can be cut to some degree by shortening the distribution process and reducing freight charges. In that sense, the direct trade, by which goods are directly sent from the production area or the distribution center to the final destination, is absolutely advantageous in terms of price. The most important foundation in building a direct trade system which ensures direct transport of imported goods and direct transaction is the expansion of a transportation network where the distribution bases of goods are connected. In this regard, at the initial stage of overseas trade, the expansion of a transportation network was of the greatest importance in the competitive relationship between Japanese and Chinese merchants who aimed to enter the Korean market through intermediate trade.At the time of initial entry into the Korean market, Chinese merchants, who were late to enter the Korean market compared to Japanese merchants, were in a relatively unfavorable position in the aspect of transportation network. To overcome this challenge, Chénshutang in charge of Chinese trade with Korea actively promoted the operation of Chinese vessels led by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Korea, under the broad support of Lǐ Hóngzhāng.Yuán Shìkǎi, who involved himself deeply in the internal affairs and diplomacy of Korea at that time, paid much attention even to the expansion of economic forces in Korea. During his reign, he gave tangible and intangible assistance in Chinese merchants' economic activities by not only promoting their normal trading activities but even neglecting or encouraging “smuggling”. The most noticeable part in his trading support for Chinese merchants would be that it was made possible for Chinese vessels operated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to regularly navigate to Korean sea routes.The total volume of Korean-Chinese trade between 1883 and 1892 was just 0.01 to 0.25% of that of China's overseas trade during the same period. Korea was of little importance to China in terms of trade advancement. Nevertheless, the Chinese government was active in supporting the economic activities of Chinese merchants in Korea, with an intention of strengthening suzerainty through the improvement of economic strength and, at the same time, countering the Japanese forces.In some ways, the act of pioneering Korean sea routes seemed to stem from several political considerations, but it would certainly be a considerable help for the trading activities of Chinese merchants in Korea. At the end of the 19th century, when railroads were not built yet, the navigation of steamship as a new means of transportation and the regular operation of vessels were the absolute conditions for the development of overseas trade."

First, this study investigated the original text of Chinese and Korean place names to correct notational errors. Then, notations of toponyms whose Chinese characters correspond to Korean ones were examined and plural toponyms were interpreted. Finally, regional dialects reflected in toponyms were investigated and a few place names whose corresponding relation between Chinese and Korean characters is vague were interpreted. Korean toponyms written in Chinese characters were generally made using the Chinese Characters-Borrowing systerm. Methods such as borrowing the notes of Chinese characters, borrow the meaning of Chinese characters, Borrow the notes and meanings of Chinese characters were used. In some cases, it is difficult to determine the method of writing Chinese characters for some placenames. For notation of Korean toponyms, phonemic writing(Yen-nang-ki, Maeul-ap, and Neuri-chang-bat) and morphemic writing(Geop-bawu and Jang-ki-deul) were used together, but the frequency that the latter was used was much higher. ‘ㆍ ()([ʌ])’ only appeared in writing of ‘Han’[large] and ‘[ʌy]’ appeared in writing of ‘Ae’, a monophthong of modern Korean language. The frequency it was used was high in the following order: ‘Jae’[hill], ‘Gae‘ [riverside]. It was used only one time in ‘Mae’[mountain], ’Sae’[bird], ‘Gae’[piece], ‘Saem’ [fountain] and ‘Jae’[fortress].

It is a very encouraging achievement in the current cultural atmosphere of the Korean inspired entertainment movement known as K-Content, that the Korean classic novel is drawing attention. A total of 101 hand-transcribed novels were completely translated and annotated, giving ordinary readers, as well as culture-related researchers, the ability to make good use of the novels included in this translated and annotated collection. This translation and annotation collection is the largest body of work conducted by a single institution, and it has great value and significance in the sense that many of the novels in the collection are either the only existing versions, rare versions, or the first annotated translations.However, the publication has some limitations. For example, it does not have enough explanations on the selection standards for the 100 works, nor does it explain the values of translation and annotation. Also, it has a few errors regarding titles, explanatory notes, translation in modern languages, and original texts. The collection should be supplemented and corrected in near future. Though recent trends show that books for ordinary readers and those for researchers are separated in the editing and structuring of the published translated and annotated version. The decision of whether, and how, to separate must consider the purpose of the publication and overall conditions.As for follow-up works after the publication of the collection, several suggestions are presented. They include additional writing to utilize the translated works, collaboration with interdisciplinary researchers, culture service and goods producers, active use of the Taekmin Academy of Korean Studies’ website, establishment of a literary house for classic novels, and the development of programs urging for more policy supports.As an example of explanation for developing cultural content, Songbuinjeon, which is one of the first-year annotated translations, is briefly introduced. It is easy to think that Songbuinjeon is a familiar story of a woman’s suffering, but it contains a serious theme in more or less schematic and popular development, and thus it can be read with interest by today’s readers. It is a description of a young and weak woman’s growth, and at the same time a description of hope showing the possibility of a non-blood community through affectionate gazes toward the socially underprivileged.

"말한다는 것, 이른 바 ‘왈(曰)을 둘러싼 한글 소설 향유층의 의사소통 이해와 실천 : 한국서사문학사의 발화동사를 둘러싼 ‘어휘군/어휘장’ 분석을 경유하여",2021,"['왈', '발화동사', '한글', '언문', '언문 대중', '소설', '감정', '감정 수사', '감성', '어휘군', '어휘장', '낱말밭', '말하다', '의사소통', 'wal', 'utterance verb', 'hangeul', 'eonmun', 'eonmum-public', 'novel', 'emotion', 'emotional rhetorics', 'affect', 'lexical field', 'vocaburary group', 'speak', 'communication. 曰']","이 글에서는 조선시대 서사문학의 발화동사 ‘왈’의 역동적 변화에 주목해, 소설 향유층이 공유한 ‘말하기’를 둘러싼 사유와 의사소통에 대한 이해의 실제를 해명했다. 연구 대상으로 고려시대부터 19세기 초까지 총 4,550개의 발화표지(‘없음’ 포함)에 대해 ‘말하기’를 둘러싼 ‘어휘군’, ‘어휘장’의 개념으로 접근하여, 통계적ㆍ수사적 차원에서 분석했다. <삼국유사>에 서술된 발화동사는 ‘曰’(84%), ‘云’(10%), 기타(5%), 없음(1%) 순이다. <수이전>의 경우는 ‘曰’이 전체 발화동사의 89%다. 발화동사가 중첩된 경우는 존대, 명령, 질문, 대답, 보고, 청유, 의논, 통지, 부탁, 위장(속임) 등을 지시하는 한자를 ‘曰’과 결합한 형식이다. 15세기 소설 <금오신화>에서는 ‘曰’이 전체 발화동사의 99%를 차지할 정도로 전면화되었다. 이 중에서 25%는 대사의 성격이나 문장 형식(평서문, 의문문, 명령문 등)을 지시하는 한자와 결합해, 말하기를 둘러싼 정보성이 구체화ㆍ분화된 양상을 보였다. 17세기 한문소설 <최척전>과 <운영전>에서도 ‘曰’은 한문소설에서 ‘말하다’를 대표하는 발화표지로 정착했음이 확인된다. 17세기 한글소설 <숙향전>과 <사씨남정기>에서는 각각 85%, 56%의 발화표지가 한문 ‘曰’을 한글표기 ‘왈’로 대체했고, 0.4%, 23%는 한글표현에 ‘왈’을 결합해 사용했으며, 각각 14%, 15%에서는 고유어 발화동사를 택하되, 문맥과 상황, 존대법에 맞는 다양한 단어를 사용했다. 18세기 소설 <유씨삼대록>에서 ‘왈’은 74%가 사용되었고, 전체의 74%는 감정수사와 결합했다. 한글 발화동사(대사/인용/독백)는 24%이며종류는 17개로, 17세기 한글 소설의 사례와 대동소이하다, 19세기 <남원고사>에서 발화동사의 표기에 비약적 변화가 발견된다. ‘왈’은 전체 발화동사사의 1%에 불과해, 한글 발화표지가 전면화되고, 감정 수사의 비중도 높아졌으며, 고유어 발화표지가 증가했다. 이 논문은 이러한 변화를 한글 소설의 문화문해적 역량 강화 및 언어 차원의 미학적 실천으로 간주하고, 발화동사에 결부된 감정 수사의 확대 양상을 분석함으로써. ‘말하기’란 소리-전달의 문제가 아니라 ‘전신적 의사소통’임을 해명했다. 결론에서는 21세기 디지털 시대에 이러한 의사소통에 대한 축적된 이해를 활용할 수 있는 구체적 방안을 제안했다.","This article focuses on the dynamic changes surrounding the use of ‘wal (曰)’, which marks the utterance of the speaker in the text recorded in Korean during the Chosǒn Era, and invests the thoughts and communication surrounding the ‘speaking’ shared by the novel audience/reader. For the study, narrative texts recorded in Korean/Chinese script from the Goryǒ Era to the early 19th century were selected, and a total of 4,550 utterance words were analyzed with the concepts of ‘vocabulary group’ and ‘lexical field’ surrounding ‘speaking’. Statistics of the utterances used in [conversation/monologue/quote/commentary/eulogy] described in Samkuk-yusa are as follows: ‘曰’ (84%), ‘云’ (10%), and others (5%), ‘none’ (1%), etc. In the 15th-century novel Keumoh-shinhwa, ‘wal’ was widespread, accounting for 99% of all utterance words. The conversion of ‘曰’ continued in the 17th century novels written in Chinese Characters Ch’oe-ch’ǒk-jǒn and Unyǒng-jǒn. In the 17th-century Korean novels Sukhyangjǒn and Sassi Namjǒnggi, 85% and 56% of the utterance words replaced the Chinese character ‘曰’ with the hangeul ‘wal (왈)’. Of the 1,031 utterances of the 18th-century novel Yussisamdaerok, 74% of ‘Wal (왈)’ was used. In the 19th century Namwongosa, the notation of utterance words showed a drastic change. First of all, ‘wal (왈)’ is only 1% of all utterances. Hangul utterances will be full-scale. This thesis named this as the cultural literacy capacity reinforcement of Hangul novels and the aesthetic practice of the language level, and analyzed the expanding aspects of the emotional investigation associated with the utterance history."

The collected data were analyzed through coding, classification, and categorization stages.in five steps: coding and elimination stage, sample metaphor compilation and translation stage, sorting and categorization stage, establishing the inter-coder reliability rate, and analyzing data quantitatively. Results According to the analysis, play was divided into three categories: the energy through play, the leap through play, and the immersion through play. Child care teachers perceived that play had 11 characteristics: fun and happiness, learning, imagination, life, inscape, growth, relationship, self motivation, healing, fulfillment, development. Conclusions This study is meaningful in that child care teachers positively form their beliefs and values for play, understand play-based curriculum and present the need of teacher education to cultivate the competence of supporting young children’s, along with basic material."
Hemodynamic Management of Acute Spinal Cord Injury: A Literature Review,2021,"['Spinal cord injury', 'Hemodynamic management', 'Mean arterial pressure', 'Spinal cord perfusion pressure']",,"The goal of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) management is to reduce secondary injuries and improve neurological recovery after its occurrence. This review aimed to explore the literature regarding hemodynamic management to reduce ischemic secondary injury and improve neurologic outcome following acute SCI. The PubMed database was searched for studies investigating blood flow, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and spinal cord perfusion pressure after SCI. The 2013 guidelines of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons recommended maintaining MAP at 85–90 mmHg for 7 days after SCI to potentially improve outcome. However, this recommendation was based on weak evidence for neurologic benefit. The maintenance of MAP will typically require vasopressors, which may have their own set of complications. More recently, studies have suggested the potential importance of considering spinal cord perfusion pressure in addition to the MAP. Further research on the hemodynamic management of acute SCI is required to determine how to optimize neurologic recovery. Evidence-based guidelines for hemodynamic management should acknowledge the gaps in knowledge and the limitations of the current literature."
Analysis on the FLYCHK opacity of X-pinch wire materials,2021,['Opacity · FLYCHK · X-pinch · Planck mean opacity · Rosseland mean opacity · Multi-group opacity'],,"The plasma opacities of the widely used X-pinch target materials (Cu, Mo, W) are calculated over a wide temperature and density range (T = 10– 3–102 keV, ρ = 1016– 1024 cm− 3) by using the collisional radiative code FLYCHK. Including the scattering effect, the FLYCHK opacity of the mid-Z element copper is in good agreement with the Los Alamos opacity code ATOMIC in the broad T–ρ range corresponding to typical X-pinch plasma conditions. In a strongly coupled region, a few corrections, such as the degeneracy effect for the free–free opacity, may be required to improve accuracies. The absence of a Δn = 0 transition and the simple scattering opacity formula in FLYCHK also cause the characteristics of the FLYCHK opacity data. The plasma opacities of the high-Z elements molybdenum and tungsten are also calculated. These results can be used as basic inputs for various radiative hydrodynamic simulations not only for X-pinch plasmas but for different types of high-energy–density plasma research."
