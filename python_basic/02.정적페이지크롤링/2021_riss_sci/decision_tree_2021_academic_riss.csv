CAE와 Decision-tree를 이용한 사출성형 공정개선에 관한 연구,2021,"['Artificial Neural Networks', 'Computer Aided Engineering', 'Decision-tree', 'Injection Molding', 'Multi-Layer Perceptron', 'Warpage']","현재 사출성형분야의 Computer Aided Testing(CAT) 방법론으로 CAE(Computer Aided Engineering)를 이용한 수치 해석 기법이 주를 이루고 있다. 그러나 최근 시뮬레이션에 추가로 인공지능 기법을 응용하는 방법론이 연구되고 있다. 우리는 지난 연구에서 다양한 Machine Learning 기법을 활용하여 사출 성형 공정에 따른 변형 결과를 비교하였으며, 최종적으로 MLP(Multi-Layer Perceptron) 예측모델을 생성하였고, HMA(Hybrid Metaheuristic Algorithm)를 이용하여 최적화 결과를 얻어냈다. 그러나 MLP는 예측 성능이 우수한 반면 블랙박스와 같이 결정 과정에 대한 설명이 부족하다. 본 연구에서는 Radiator Tank 부품에 대하여 사출 성형 해석 소프트웨어인 Autodesk Moldflow 2018을 이용하여 수치 해석 기법으로 데이터를 생성하고, Machine Learning 소프트웨어인 RapidMiner Studio version 9.5를 활용하여 여러 Machine Learning Algorithms 모델을 생성하여 평균 제곱근 오차를 비교하였다. Decision-tree는 Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) 값이 다른 Machine Learning 기법에 비해 양호한 예측 성능을 갖추고 있었다. Decision-tree의 크기를 결정하는 Maximal Depth에 따라 분류 기준을 높일 수 있지만 복잡성도 함께 증가시켰다. Decision-tree를 이용하여 구속 조건을 만족하는 중간 값을 선정하여 시뮬레이션을 진행한 결과 기존의 시뮬레이션만 진행한 것보다 7.7%의 개선 효과가 있었다.","The CAT methodology is a numerical analysis technique using CAE. Recently, a methodology of applying artificial intelligence techniques to a simulation has been studied. A previous study compared the deformation results according to the injection molding process using a machine learning technique. Although MLP has excellent prediction performance, it lacks an explanation of the decision process and is like a black box. In this study, data was generated using Autodesk Moldflow 2018, an injection molding analysis software. Several Machine Learning Algorithms models were developed using RapidMiner version 9.5, a machine learning platform software, and the root mean square error was compared. The decision-tree showed better prediction performance than other machine learning techniques with the RMSE values. The classification criterion can be increased according to the Maximal Depth that determines the size of the Decision-tree, but the complexity also increases. The simulation showed that by selecting an intermediate value that satisfies the constraint based on the changed position, there was 7.7% improvement compared to the previous simulation."
A Study on the Prediction of Community Smart Pension Intention Based on Decision Tree Algorithm,2021,"['Decision Tree', 'Prediction Model', 'C4.5 Algorithm', 'Community smart pension', '10-fold cross-validation']",,"With the deepening of population aging, pension has become an urgent problem in most countries. Community smart pension can effectively resolve the problem of traditional pension, as well as meet the personalized and multi-level needs of the elderly. To predict the pension intention of the elderly in the community more accurately, this paper uses the decision tree classification method to classify the pension data. After missing value processing, normalization, discretization and data specification, the discretized sample data set is obtained. Then, by comparing the information gain and information gain rate of sample data features, the feature ranking is determined, and the C4.5 decision tree model is established. The model performs well in accuracy, precision, recall, AUC and other indicators under the condition of 10-fold cross-validation, and the precision was 89.5%, which can provide the certain basis for government decision-making."
MRI Predictors of Malignant Transformation in Patients with Inverted Papilloma: A Decision Tree Analysis Using Conventional Imaging Features and Histogram Analysis of Apparent Diffusion Coefficients,2021,"['Inverted papilloma', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Diffusion']",,"Objective: Preoperative differentiation between inverted papilloma (IP) and its malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma (IP-SCC) is critical for patient management. We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of conventional imaging features and histogram parameters obtained from whole tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values to predict IP-SCC in patients with IP, using decision tree analysis.Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed data generated from the records of 180 consecutive patients with histopathologically diagnosed IP or IP-SCC who underwent head and neck magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging and 62 patients were included in the study. To obtain whole tumor ADC values, the region of interest was placed to cover the entire volume of the tumor. Classification and regression tree analyses were performed to determine the most significant predictors of IP-SCC among multiple covariates. The final tree was selected by cross-validation pruning based on minimal error.Results: Of 62 patients with IP, 21 (34%) had IP-SCC. The decision tree analysis revealed that the loss of convoluted cerebriform pattern and the 20th percentile cutoff of ADC were the most significant predictors of IP-SCC. With these decision trees, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and C-statistics were 86% (18 out of 21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 65–95%), 100% (41 out of 41; 95% CI, 91–100%), 95% (59 out of 61; 95% CI, 87–98%), and 0.966 (95% CI, 0.912–1.000), respectively.Conclusion: Decision tree analysis using conventional imaging features and histogram analysis of whole volume ADC could predict IP-SCC in patients with IP with high diagnostic accuracy."
Decision Tree Model for Predicting Hospice Palliative Care Use in Terminal Cancer Patients,2021,"['Advance directives', 'Neoplasms', 'Hospices', 'Palliative care', 'Decision trees']",,"Purpose: This study attempted to develop clinical guidelines to help patients use hospice and palliative care (HPC) at an appropriate time after writing physician orders for life-sustaining treatment (POLST) by identifying the characteristics of HPC use of patients with terminal cancer. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted to understand the characteristics of HPC use of patients with terminal cancer through decision tree analysis. The participants were 394 terminal cancer patients who were hospitalized at a cancer-specialized hospital in Seoul, South Korea and wrote POLST from January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2021. Results: The predictive model for the characteristics of HPC use showed three main nodes (living together, pain control, and period to death after writing POLST). The decision tree analysis of HPC use by terminal cancer patients showed that the most likely group to use HPC use was terminal cancer patients who had a cohabitant, received pain control, and died 2 months or more after writing a POLST. The probability of HPC usage rate in this group was 87.5%. The next most likely group to use HPC had a cohabitant and received pain control; 64.8% of this group used HPC. Finally, 55.1% of participants who had a cohabitant used HPC, which was a significantly higher proportion than that of participants who did not have a cohabitant (1.7%). Conclusion: This study provides meaningful clinical evidence to help make decisions on HPC use more easily at an appropriate time."

A New Hybrid Approach of Clustering Based Probabilistic Decision Tree to Forecast Wind Power on Large Scales,2021,['Wind power forecast  · K-means clustering  · NB tree  · Machine learning  · Windfarm'],,"The wind power forecasting plays a vital role in renewable energy production. Due to the dynamic and uncertain behavior of wind, it is really hard to catch the actual features of wind for accurate forecasting measures. The patchy and instability of wind leading to the assortment of training samples have a main infl uence on the forecasting accuracy. For this purpose, an accurate forecasting method is needed. This paper proposed a new hybrid approach of clustering based probabilistic decision tree to forecast wind power effi ciently. The collected data is screened for noisy information and selected those variables which mainly contribute in accurate predictions. Then, the wind data is normalized using mean and standard deviation to extract playing level fi elds for each feature. Based on the similarity of the data behavior, the K-means clustering algorithm is applied to classify the samples into diff erent groups which contain the historical wind data. Further, the Naïve Bayes (NB) tree is proposed to extract probabilities for each feature in the clusters. The NB tree is a hybrid model of C4.5 and NB methods that successfully applied on three big real-world wind datasets (hourly, monthly, yearly) collected from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The forecasting accuracy exposed that the proposed method could forecast an accurate wind power from hours to years’ data. Comprehensive comparisons are made of the proposed method with the most popular state of the art techniques which show that this method provides more accurate prediction results."
A Study on a car Insurance purchase Prediction Using Two-Class Logistic Regression and Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'Two-Class Logistic Regression', 'Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree', 'Car Insurance', 'Purchase', 'Prediction']",,"This paper predicted a model that indicates whether to buy a car based on primary health insurance customer data. Currently, automobiles are being used to land transportation and living, and the scope of use and equipment is expanding. This rapid increase in automobiles has caused automobile insurance to emerge as an essential business target for insurance companies. Therefore, if the car insurance sales are predicted and sold using the information of existing health insurance customers, it can generate continuous profits in the insurance company s operating performance. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze existing customer characteristics and implement a predictive model to activate advertisements for customers interested in such auto insurance. The goal of this study is to maximize the profits of insurance companies by devising communication strategies that can optimize business models and profits for customers. This study was conducted through the Microsoft Azure program, and an automobile insurance purchase prediction model was implemented using Health Insurance Cross-sell Prediction data. The program algorithm uses Two-Class Logistic Regression and Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree at the same time to compare two models and predict and compare the results.

A defining feature of CAT stems from its item selection algorithms, among which both research interest and practical applications of decision-tree based CAT (DT-based CAT) have been rising recently. In the field of machine learning, however, it is well known that decision-trees, as a form of predictive models with simple and interpretable tree structures, can be vulnerable to the problem of overfitting or the problem of creating overly complex trees that do not generalize to newly observed data. Among various ensemble techniques developed to adequately address this problem, we the authors paid attention to the Alternating Model Tree (AMT) due to its interpretable tree-like structure. The purpose of this article is to investigate the viability of the Alternating Model Tree (AMT) as an item selection algorithm for constructing CAT. To this end, we first presented a detailed exposition of how AMT-based CAT can be constructed and then compared its performance with DT-based CAT using two sets of publicly available psychological test scores. The results provided supportive evidence that AMT-based CAT is viable, and that AMT-based CAT can predict test scores at least as accurate as DT-based CAT does. Based on our findings, we discuss implications, limitations, and directions of future studies."
A Decision Making Method for Reconfiguration of Adaptive Info-communications Systems,2021,"['IT System', 'Adaptation', 'Decision-Making', 'Criterion', 'Uncertainty', 'Suitability', 'Reconfiguration']",,"The adaptation both information and communication systems to variable external factors is implemented through the modernization activities. In this paper the problem of decision-making for adaptive system reconfiguration under uncertainty is considered. The decision-making method is used to detect a need for reconfiguration, built a set of reconfigurations plans and choose the preferable one based on data collection from diagnostic sensor network. Integral decision-making criterion combines the criterion for selecting a suitable reconfiguration moment and alternative. The main idea of the proposed method is to combine the multifactor active diagnostic model, weighted utility and preference theory, decision-making technique under uncertainty with comparison methods for fuzzy trees with incomplete requirement. The general result is achieved by reducing the uncertainty of diagnostic data. It is expected that the proposed decision-making method will help to improve the systems’ suitability in the case of uncertainty."
Research on rapid source term estimation in nuclear accident emergency decision for pressurized water reactor based on Bayesian network,2021,"['Pressurized water reactor', 'Nuclear emergency decision making', 'Source term estimation', 'Probabilistic risk assessment', 'Bayesian network']",,"Nuclear emergency preparedness and response is an essential part to ensure the safety of nuclear power plant (NPP). Key support technologies of nuclear emergency decision-making usually consist of accident diagnosis, source term estimation, accident consequence assessment, and protective action recommendation. Source term estimation is almost the most difficult part among them. For example, bad communication, incomplete information, as well as complicated accident scenario make it hard to determine the reactor status and estimate the source term timely in the Fukushima accident. Subsequently, it leads to the hard decision on how to take appropriate emergency response actions. Hence, this paper aims to develop a method for rapid source term estimation to support nuclear emergency decision making in pressurized water reactor NPP. The method aims to make our knowledge on NPP provide better support nuclear emergency. Firstly, this paper studies how to build a Bayesian network model for the NPP based on professional knowledge and engineering knowledge. This paper presents a method transforming the PRA model (event trees and fault trees) into a corresponding Bayesian network model. To solve the problem that some physical phenomena which are modeled as pivotal events in level 2 PRA, cannot find sensors associated directly with their occurrence, a weighted assignment approach based on expert assessment is proposed in this paper. Secondly, the monitoring data of NPP are provided to the Bayesian network model, the real-time status of pivotal events and initiating events can be determined based on the junction tree algorithm. Thirdly, since PRA knowledge can link the accident sequences to the possible release categories, the proposed method is capable to find the most likely release category for the candidate accidents scenarios, namely the source term. The probabilities of possible accident sequences and the source term are calculated. Finally, the prototype software is checked against several sets of accident scenario data which are generated by the simulator of AP1000-NPP, including large loss of coolant accident, loss of main feedwater, main steam line break, and steam generator tube rupture. The results show that the proposed method for rapid source term estimation under nuclear emergency decision making is promising."
Decision-Making in Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: Insights into Atrial Functional Mitral Regurgitation,2021,"['Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair', 'MitraClip', 'Mitral repair', 'Surgery', 'Atrial func- tional mitral regurgitation']",,"The 2020 American College of Cardiology focused update on the mitral regurgitation (MR) pathway provides an excellent summary of the decision-making trees in the treatment of severe MR, in which 2 main branches of the flowchart are suggested depending on whether MR is primary or secondary. Surgery is suggested as preferable over transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) in primary MR that needs intervention. The decision-making for secondary MR generally prioritizes TEER over surgery according to the guidelines, but further stratification is necessary based on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of MR. TEER is probably the more suitable option in secondary MR caused by left ventricular dysfunc- tion or dilatation, given the high perceived surgical risks, despite the lack of sufficient evi- dence in support of overt clinical benefits from surgical therapy in these patients. In atrial functional MR associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), however, concomitant ablation of AF seems to be a desirable option, as it has been demonstrated to be a key factor leading to improved survival, reduced stroke risk, and more durable mitral and tricuspid function in patients undergoing mitral surgery. Therefore, atrial functional MR requiring intervention may be best treated by surgical therapy that combines mitral repair and AF ablation in the majority of patients. This particular issue, however, needs further research to obtain scien- tific evidence to guide optimal management strategies."
Bond strength of corroded reinforcement in concrete: Neural and tree based approaches,2021,"['artificial neural network', 'decision tree', 'bond strength', 'concrete', 'corrosion', 'reinforcement']",,"Reinforcement corrosion affects the existing concrete structures, particularly in the coastal regions. One of the effects of corrosion of reinforcement is degradation of the bond stress that can be developed between the reinforcement and the surrounding concrete and this in turn affects the capacity of the reinforced concrete member. Prediction of the bond stress applicable for the corroded reinforcement has been attempted using analytical, empirical and soft computing methods. This article presents the comparative performance of two data-driven tools, artificial neural network (ANN) and decision tree (DT) for the task of prediction of bond stress from the corrosion level, the compressive strength of concrete and the ratio of cover and diameter of reinforcement bar. From the extensive evaluation of performance with both quantitative and graphical methods, it was concluded that the ANN approach would be better suited for the application, with the available data. For development of the models 8-fold cross validation scheme was adopted due to the limitations of data. The ANN models trained with pull-out test data, when employed with ensemble approach in predictive mode for a different experiment setup and bond strength test (flexural) data, could produce results comparable to ANN models trained with flexural test data (reported in literature). The inclusion of the additional factors (compressive strength of concrete and the ratio of cover and diameter of reinforcement bar), 8-fold cross validation approach, and ensemble prediction could be the possible reasons for achieving such portability of pull-out test based model for prediction of flexural test data."
CNN-based Fast Split Mode Decision Algorithm for Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Inter Prediction,2021,"['Versatile Video Coding (VVC)', 'Inter Prediction', 'Fast algorithm', 'Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)', 'Deep learning']",,"Versatile Video Coding (VVC) is the latest video coding standard developed by Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET). In VVC, the quadtree plus multi-type tree (QT+MTT) structure of coding unit (CU) partition is adopted, and its computational complexity is considerably high due to the brute-force search for recursive rate-distortion (RD) optimization. In this paper, we aim to reduce the time complexity of inter-picture prediction mode since the inter prediction accounts for a large portion of the total encoding time. The problem can be defined as classifying the split mode of each CU. To classify the split mode effectively, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) called multi-level tree (MLT-CNN) architecture is introduced. For boosting classification performance, we utilize additional information including inter-picture information while training the CNN. The overall algorithm including the MLT-CNN inference process is implemented on VVC Test Model (VTM) 11.0. The CUs of size 128×128 can be the inputs of the CNN. The sequences are encoded at the random access (RA) configuration with five QP values {22, 27, 32, 37, 42}. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the computational complexity by 11.53% on average, and 26.14% for the maximum with an average 1.01% of the increase in Bjøntegaard delta bit rate (BDBR). Especially, the proposed method shows higher performance on the sequences of the A and B classes, reducing 9.81%~26.14% of encoding time with 0.95%~3.28% of the BDBR increase."

For data analysis, descriptive statistics and logistic regression with complex samples and decision tree analysis were performed using IBM SPSS ver. 25.0 and Stata ver. 16.0. Results: A total of 1,731 participants (3.0%) out of 57,303 responded that they had attempted suicide. The most significant predictors of suicide attempts as determined using the logistic regression model were experience of sadness and hopelessness, substance abuse, and violent victimization. Girls who have experience of sadness and hopelessness, and experience of substance abuse have been identified as the most vulnerable group in suicide attempts in the decision tree model. Conclusion: Experiences of sadness and hopelessness, experiences of substance abuse, and experiences of violent victimization were the common major predictors of suicide attempts in both logistic regression and decision tree models, and the predict rates of both models were similar. We suggest to provide programs considering combination of high-risk predictors for adolescents to prevent suicide attempt."
대표적인 의사결정나무 알고리즘의 해석력 비교,2021,"['Interpretability Comparison', 'Stability Measure', 'Decision Tree']",,"Most of the open-source decision tree algorithms are based on three splitting criteria (Entropy, Gini Index, and Gain Ratio). Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of these three popular algorithms need to be studied more thoroughly. Comparisons of the three algorithms were mainly performed with respect to the predictive performance. In this work, we conducted a comparative experiment on the splitting criteria of three decision trees, focusing on their interpretability. Depth, homogeneity, coverage, lift, and stability were used as indicators for measuring interpretability. To measure the stability of decision trees, we present a measure of the stability of the root node and the stability of the dominating rules based on a measure of the similarity of trees. Based on 10 data collected from UCI and Kaggle, we compare the interpretability of DT (Decision Tree) algorithms based on three splitting criteria. The results show that the GR (Gain Ratio) branch-based DT algorithm performs well in terms of lift and homogeneity, while the GINI (Gini Index) and ENT (Entropy) branch-based DT algorithms performs well in terms of coverage. With respect to stability, considering both the similarity of the dominating rule or the similarity of the root node, the DT algorithm according to the ENT splitting criterion shows the best results."

Quality attributes for a total of 6 dimensions and 23 service elements were divided into bank employees and customer groups, and service priorities were derived after comparative analysis. The Decision tree model was used to supplement the excessive simplification of quality attributes by the modest number of Kano models and to classify and predict by segment market. Of the 23 services, 16 were classified into the same attributes in both groups. 6 services classified as combination attributes used a Decision tree to identify differences in perception of quality attributes among groups. In terms of basic financial services and professional financial services, it was confirmed that bank employees feel financial service robots more attractive than ordinary customers. In the design of IT convergence service, we propose a methodology for deriving quality attributes by combining a Kano model for classifying quality attributes of two groups and a Decision tree for forecasting subdivision markets."

It differs from previous studies in that it typified households by income level, utilized a variety of variables that were not used before to improve performance of the model, and conducted decision tree analysis, a representative method of machine learning.According to the results, as income increased, the ratio of delinquency experiences and subjective debt burdens decreased, while financial fitness became better, which raises the need to pay attention to the vulnerability of low-income households. In addition, according to the decision tree analysis, the most important variable that increases the possibility of debt delinquency, regardless of income class, was subjective debt burden. Other variables showed different importance depending on the income level. Redeemability, DTA(Debt to Asset Ratio) and residence types were important variables in low- and middle-income models, while credit card-related loans, redeemability, and consumption-purpose loans found to be important in high-income model.This study draws suggestions by income class as follows: First of all, low-income households, particularly vulnerable to external shocks such as benchmark interest rate hikes, should ease their debt burden through Debt Management, and credit counseling should be combined to help them completely escape from debt. For mid-income households, strengthening financial fitness centered on asset formation should be supported. Finally, in the case of high-income households, monitoring is necessary for some groups that are likely to be overdue, considering householders’ age, occupation, and whether they have a credit card loans."

Planning level and impulsivity of the most recent suicide attempt were assessed, and the following were assessed and used as the main predictors: depression, hopelessness, negative urgency, cognitive flexibility, and stress experience. Using decision tree analysis, the results indicated that the interaction between depression and negative urgency predicted the planning level of suicide attempt.Specifically, the higher the level of depression, the higher the planning level of a suicide attempt. In cases of low levels of depression, a higher level of negative urgency predicted the planning level. The psychosocial factors that predicted impulsivity of suicide attempt were the interaction of depression, cognitive flexibility (control and alternatives), and hopelessness.First, the lower the level of depression, the greater the impulsivity of a suicide attempt. Second, when depression levels were low, higher levels of control and alternatives predicted the impulsivity. Third, when the levels of depression, control, and alternatives were low, hopelessness predicted the impulsivity.

AI의 출현과 진화를 하나의 사회 현상으로 보고, 시민이 추구하는 목표와 궤적을 함께 하는지에 대한 비판적 수용 교육을 견지할 필요가 있다. 이를 위해 AI에 대한 다양한 사회적 이슈를 사회과 교실수업에 도입하여 학습자가 인간의 본질적 가치에 기반하여 고민하고 논의할 수 있는 반성적 학습경험의 제공이 필요하다. 둘째, AI를 인간을 위해 함께하는 도구로 받아들여야 한다. 이를 위해 AI에 대한 이해와 활용 교육이 필요하다. 사회과 의사결정학습이나 개념학습 등에 의사결정 알고리즘 트리, K-평균 군집 알고리즘 등의 다양한 알고리즘 활용 교육을 언플러그드(unplugged) 방식으로 도전할 필요가 있다. 나아가 AI플랫폼을 활용한 다양한 교수학습 설계를 시도하여 사회과 교수-학습의 지평을 확장 시킬 필요가 있다. 인공지능을 사람의 생각처럼 구현한다면, 즉 자의식과 자유의지를 지닌 종의 탄생은 미증유의 문제를 발생시키고, 인간의 지속 가능성을 위협할 수 있다. 사회과교육은 이러한 문제 인식을 토대로 21세기 미래 시민 사회를 대비하여 인간의 본질적 가치에 기반하여 반성적으로 사고하는 성찰적 시민성에 주목해야 할 것이다.","This study infers what kind of difference between AI and human ‘thinking’ based on previous research data, and based on this, the purpose of this study is to set the perspective of social studies education on AI. First, if we compare the thinking of humans and AI, first, AI does not have free will based on self-consciousness. The subject of decision making is the self, but AI without self-consciousness cannot be regarded as the subject of decision making. Second, AI has no mind. A key factor influencing the decision-making process is the preference and satisfaction of the decision-making entity, and it can be inferred that AI without a mind cannot have decision-making drivers such as preference and satisfaction. Based on these discussions, the perspective of social studies education on AI is presented as follows. First, it should aim for a controllable AI. It is necessary to view the emergence and evolution of AI as a social phenomenon, and to maintain critical acceptance education on whether the goal and the trajectory pursued by citizens are the same. To this end, it is necessary to introduce various social issues related to AI into social studies classroom classes to provide a reflective learning experience where learners can ponder and discuss based on the intrinsic value of human beings. Second, AI should be accepted as a co-existence for humans. For this, it is necessary to understand and use AI training. It is necessary to challenge the education using various algorithms such as decision-making algorithm tree and K-means cluster algorithm in an unplugged way for social studies decision-making learning or concept learning.

The reflectance of healthy and infected leaves and branches was acquired with 5 nm of full width at high maximum (FWHM) and then it was standardized to 10 nm, 25 nm, 50 nm, and 80 nm of FWHM. The standardized samples were divided into training and test sets at ratios of 7:3, 5:5 and 3:7 to find the optimal bands of FWHM by the decision tree analysis. Classification accuracy was evaluated using overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (KC). The hyperspectral reflectance of infected leaves and branches was significantly lower than those of healthy green, red-edge (RE) and near infrared (NIR) regions. The bands selected for the first node were generally 750 and 800 nm; these were used to identify the infection of leaves and branches, respectively. The accuracy of the classifier was higher in the 7:3 ratio. Four bands with 50 nm of FWHM (450, 650, 750, and 950 nm) might be reasonable because the difference in the recalculated accuracy between 8 bands with 10 nm of FWHM (440, 580, 640, 660, 680, 710, 730, and 740 nm) and 4 bands was only 1.8% for OA and 4.1% for KC, respectively. Finally, adding two bands (550 nm and 800 nm with 25 nm of FWHM) in four bands with 50 nm of FWHM have been proposed to improve the usability of multispectral image sensors with performing various roles in agriculture as well as detecting FB with other combinations of spectral bands."

Accordingly, foreign language assessments treat discourse competence as an important construct for determining test takers' communicative competences. However, unlike for other linguistic competences, such as grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation, it is difficult to present a clear grading scale for discourse competence that is based on the accuracy of native speakers on an absolute standard. As a result, many former assessments have used scoring rubrics with vague and subjective terms. To supplement these previous problems, this research presents a scoring rubric, based on the Performance Decision Tree method, and assesses native speakers’ discourse structures and foreign learners’ discourse characteristics per various levels of discourse competences in a REQUEST task. After conducting an additional analysis on graders’ grading tendencies, this study developed a performance-based scoring rubric by categorizing and sequencing the results. The Performance Decision Tree scoring rubric for discourse competence can contribute towards developing a more valid scoring rubric and solve the problem of scoring reliability, resulting from previous scoring rubrics’ vagueness and subjectivity."

The overall explanatory power of the calculated geographic weighted regression model was 37.4%, and it was found to be distributed from 26.0% to 35.5% by region. The average current smoking rate using interactive decision trees is 20.3%, and in the group classification of the current smoking rate, the group corresponding to type 1 is 1.2 times more likely to smoke than the current smoking rate in a total of 228 regions.

Machine Learning Enabled Steady-State Security Predictor as Deployed for Distribution Feeder Reconfiguration,2021,"['Network reconfi guration', 'Machine learning', 'Decision tree']",,"The distribution network is reconfi gured by modifying the topology arrangement of the network feeders. Because the voltage stability of the distribution networks can diff er within a range following network reconfi guration, the calculation of steady-state voltage stability plays a signifi cant role in real-time feeder reconfi guration. Examining the state of security and estimating it for the next operational confi guration is crucial for making real-time decisions. Online security evaluation needs minimal complexity and computing time. Standard methods of assessing the distribution network’s steady-state voltage stability can be insuffi cient for online and real-time environments due to their high complexity and long computing period. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach for classifying confi guration states and adopts the decision tree technique to interpret the online applications in the feeder reconfi guration. For the classifi cation, the single line equivalent L-index voltage stability and switching confi gurations of the feeders are employed as training information for the ML models.

In this study, therefore, the methodology for assessment and forecast of drought severity based on the amount of water shortage from the water balance analysis was be placed at the center of the discussion. Firstly, in order to improve the existing analysis for drought assessment adopted in the National Water Resources Plan, alternative methods have been suggested to estimate the amount of water demand in each sub-basin using the land use map, and in an aspect of water supply, reservoirs and underground water are included in the simulation of MODSIM-DSS. The relationship between drought severity from the simulated water shortage in the study area and the values of SPEIs (SPEI 6 = estimated for 6 months - winter and spring season, SPEI 3 = estimated for 3 months - summer season) has been analyzed by the Decision tree. Due to this achievement, at the end of the spring season, every year the forecast for the drought severity will be available with the quantitatively estimated water shortage, and it will be helpful to activate the drought mitigation measures before the disaster occurs."

A total of 5 machine learning classifiers were used,including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and boostedtree, to predict the recurrence based on 16 parameters (age, body mass index, gravity/parity, hypertension/diabetic,stage, histological type, grade, surgical content and adjuvant chemotherapy). We analyzed the classification accuracyand the area under the curve (AUC).ResultsThe highest accuracy was 0.82 for SVM, followed by 0.77 for RF, 0.74 for LR, 0.66 for DT, and 0.66 for boosted trees.The highest AUC was 0.53 for LR, followed by 0.52 for boosted trees, 0.48 for DT, and 0.47 for RF. Therefore, the bestpredictive model for this analysis was LR.ConclusionThe performance of the machine learning classifiers was not optimal owing to the small size of the dataset.

Employee turnover means the loss of talent in the workforce. When an employee voluntarily leaves his or her company, it will lose hiring and training cost and lead to the withdrawal of key personnel and new costs to train a new employee. From an employee's viewpoint, moving to another company is also risky because it can be time consuming and costly. Therefore, in order to reduce the social and economic costs caused by employee turnover, it is necessary to accurately predict employee turnover intention, identify the factors affecting employee turnover, and manage them appropriately in the company.Design/methodology/approachPrior studies have mainly used logistic regression and decision trees, which have explanatory power but poor predictive accuracy. In order to develop a more accurate prediction model, XGBoost is proposed as the classification technique. Then, to compensate for the lack of explainability, SHAP, one of the XAI techniques, is applied. As a result, the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is improved compared to the conventional methods such as LOGIT and Decision Trees. By applying SHAP to the proposed model, the factors affecting the overall employee turnover intention as well as a specific sample’s turnover intention are identified.FindingsExperimental results show that the prediction accuracy of XGBoost is superior to that of logistic regression and decision trees. Using SHAP, we find that jobseeking, annuity, eng_test, comm_temp, seti_dev, seti_money, equl_ablt, and sati_safe significantly affect overall employee turnover intention. In addition, it is confirmed that the factors affecting an individual’s turnover intention are more diverse. Our research findings imply that companies should adopt a personalized approach for each employee in order to effectively prevent his or her turnover."

In order to improve the classification accuracy for term deposit subscriptions, many studies have been conducted based on machine learning techniques. However, even if these models can achieve satisfactory performance, utilizing them is not an easy task in the industry when their decision-making process is not adequately explained. To address this issue, this paper proposes an explainable scheme for term deposit subscription forecasting. For this, we first construct several classification models using decision tree-based ensemble learning methods, which yield excellent performance in tabular data, such as random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). We then analyze their classification performance in depth through 10-fold cross-validation. After that, we provide the rationale for interpreting the influence of customer information and the decision-making process by applying Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), an explainable artificial intelligence technique, to the best classification model. To verify the practicality and validity of our scheme, experiments were conducted with the bank marketing dataset provided by Kaggle; we applied the SHAP to the GBM and LightGBM models, respectively, according to different dataset configurations and then performed their analysis and visualization for explainable term deposit subscriptions."

Reliability improvement in the presence of weak fault features using non-Gaussian IMF selection and AdaBoost technique,2021,['· AdaBoost · BLDC motor · Fault classification · IMF · VMD'],,"In machinery fault detection and identification (FDI), decomposing vibration signals into corresponding intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) reduces the intricacy in extracting weak fault features at the early failure state. However, selecting a suitable IMF for fault information extraction is a challenging task. Analyzing the non-Gaussian IMFs allows extracting effective fault-related information rather than the entire signal or other IMFs because the vibration signals are random in nature. In this study, we present an IMF selection method based on the maximum kurtosis value of each IMF. A kurtosis computation method named autogram is used.It considers the autocovariance function to characterize the 2nd order cyclostationary. We deploy the AdaBoost algorithm with a decision tree classifier to gain a better performance compared with other tree-based classifiers.

This problem involves more complex states and action spaces than traditional confrontation games, making it difficult to search for any strategy with human-level performance. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning model to solve this problem from the perspective of game simulations and algorithm implementation. A reverse reinforcement-learning model based on high-level player training data is established to support downstream algorithms. With less training data, the proposed model is converged quicker, and more consistent with the action strategies of high-level players’ decision-making. Then an intelligent deduction algorithm based on DDQN is developed to achieve a better generalization ability under the guidance of a given reward function. At the game simulation level, this paper constructs Monte Carlo Tree SearchIntelligent Decision Model for turn-based antagonistic deduction games to generate next-step actions. Furthermore, a prototype game simulator that combines offline with online functions is implemented to verify the performance of proposed model and algorithm. The experiments show that our proposed approach not only has a better reference value to the antagonistic environment using incomplete information, but also accurate and effective in predicting the return value.

It does not predict equipment failure with just one or two signs, but quantifies and models numerous symptoms and historical data of actual failure. Statistical methods were used a lot in the past as this predictive maintenance method, but recently, many machine learning-based methods have been proposed. Such proposed machine learning-based methods are preferable in that they show more accurate prediction performance. However, with the exception of some learning models such as decision tree-based models, it is very difficult to explicitly know the structure of learning models (Black-Box Model) and to explain to what extent certain attributes (features or variables) of the learning model affected the prediction results. To overcome this problem, a recently proposed study is an explainable artificial intelligence (AI). It is a methodology that makes it easy for users to understand and trust the results of machine learning-based learning models. In this paper, we propose an explainable AI method to further enhance the explanatory power of the existing learning model by targeting the previously proposedpredictive model [5] that learned data from a core facility (Hyper Compressor) of a domestic chemical plant that produces polyethylene. The ensemble prediction model, which is a black box model, wasconverted to a white box model using the Explainable AI. The proposed methodology explains the direction of control for the major features in the failure prediction results through the Explainable AI. Through this methodology, it is possible to flexibly replace the timing of maintenance of the machine and supply and demand of parts, and to improve the efficiency of the facility operation through proper pre-control."

A previous study suggested that hard stabilization appliance therapy was effective for patients with local myalgia who developed long facets on their occlusal appliances. The objective of this study was to identify patients in whom a soft occlusal appliance should be used to treat masticatory muscle pain by analyzing the type of muscle pain present and patient factors that influenced the effectiveness of this treatment. Methods: The study included 42 patients diagnosed with local myalgia or myofascial pain according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders Diagnostic Decision Tree. The analysis of patient factors included variables believed to be associated with temporomandibular disorders. First, a temporary screening appliance was used for 2 weeks to assess each patient for bruxism during sleep. Soft appliance therapy was then started. For each patient, the effectiveness of the appliance was evaluated according to the intensity of tenderness during muscle palpation and the treatment satisfaction score at one month after starting treatment. Results: Data from 37 of the 42 patients were available for analysis. Twenty-five patients reported satisfaction with the appliance. In logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for reduction of facet length was 1.998. Nineteen patients showed at least a 30% improvement in the visual analog scale score. The odds ratio for local myalgia was 18.148. Conclusion: Soft appliance therapy may be used in patients with local myalgia. Moreover, patients who develop short facets on the appliance surface are likely to be satisfied with soft appliance therapy. Soft appliance therapy may be appropriate for patients with local myalgia who develop short facets on their occlusal appliance."
"Machine Learning Application in Genomic, Exercise, and Vital Datasets",2021,"['Machine learning', 'Genomics', 'Vital', 'Datasets', 'Exercise science']",,"PURPOSE: Machine learning (ML) refers to newly developed computer algorithms that are improved through iterative experiences. ML applications are expected to assist humans in analyzing large amounts of data. This review has outlined the application of ML in analyzing variable vital data such as walking steps, exercise intensity, heart rate, sleeping hours, sleep quality, resting heart rate, blood pressure, and calorie consumption in a day. Vital data consist of different variables that are closely related to genomic or exercise data. The prediction of healthy traits from a vital dataset has become a necessity in personalized medicine.METHODS: Considerations and repeated tasks in supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised ML methods are presented. ML methods such as artificial neural networks, Bayesian networks, support vector machines, and decision trees have been widely used in biomedical studies to develop predictive models. Through vital data, these models can help in effective and accurate decision-making for a healthier life.PURPOSE: Models based on genomic, exercise, and vital datasets provide a healthy lifestyle through regular exercise. We have provided guidelines to help in the selection of these ML methods and their practical application for variable vital data analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Our guidelines could serve as a foundation for implementing both participatory medicine and data-driven exercise science."
Is percutaneous destruction of a solitary liver colorectal metastasis as effective as a resection?,2021,"['Hepatic resection', 'Liver metastases', 'Solitary', 'Microwave ablation', 'Percutaneous']",,"Backgrounds/Aims: Surgical resection remains the gold standard in the treatment of colorectal liver metastasis. However, when a patient presents with a deep solitary colorectal liver metastasis (S-CLM), the balance between the hepatic volume sacrificed and the S-CLM volume is sometimes clearly unappropriated. Thus, alternatives to surgery, such as operative and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA), have been developed. This study aimed to identify the prognostic factors affecting survival of patients with S-CLM who undergo curative-intent liver resection or local destruction (RFA or MWA). Methods: We retrospectively identified 211 patients with synchronous or metachronous S-CLM who underwent either surgical resection (n=182) or local destruction (RFA or MWA; n=29) according to the S-CLM size, location, and surrounding Glissonian structures. Results: Patients who underwent RFA or MWA had S-CLM of a smaller size than those who underwent resection (mean 19.7 vs. 37.3 mm, p＜.01). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 97.4%, 84.9%, and 74.9%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 77.9%, 47%, and 38.9%, respectively. S-CLM located in the left liver (p=.04), S-CLM KRAS mutation (p＜.01), and extra-hepatic recurrence (p＜.01) were identified as independent poor risk factors for overall survival (OS); the OS and DFS were comparable in patients with surgical procedure or percutaneous MWA. Conclusions: In eligible S-CLM cases, percutaneous MWA seems to be as oncologically efficient as surgical resection and should be include in the decision-tree for treatment strategies."

Therefore, accurate construction cost prediction and quick decision-making are important factors for efficient cost and process management. Overseas, the construction information classification system has been standardized since 1980 and has been continuously developed, improving construction productivity by systematically collecting and utilizing project life cycle information. At domestic construction sites, attempts have been made to standardize the classification system of construction information, but it is difficult to achieve continuous standardization and systematization due to the absence of a standardization body and differences in cost and process management methods for each construction company. Particular, in the case of the high-tech industry, the standardization and systematization level of the construction information classification system for high-tech facility construction is very low due to problems such as large scale, numerous types of work, complex construction and security. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to construct a construction information classification system suitable for high-tech facility construction through collection, classification, and analysis of related project data constructed in Korea. Based on the WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) and CBS (Cost Breakdown Structure) classified and analyzed through this study, a code system through hierarchical classification was proposed, and the cost model of buildings by linking WBS and CBS was three-dimensionalized and the utilized method was presented. Through this, an information classification system based on inter-relationships can be developed beyond the one-way tree structure, which is a general construction information classification system, and effects such as shortening of construction period and cost reduction will be maximized."

The purpose of this study is to identify the ideal combination of movie scenarios by defining the types of movies preferred by the audience as a rule based on the user’s rating data using a random forest. Therefore, this paper tried to interpret the movie scenario conditions that determine the success or failure of a movie in terms of 18 genres and age groups as rules according to audience ratings. In addition, the usefulness(frequency) and reliability(error) of the rule composed of scenario conditions and outcomes (success and failure) were used as the criteria for selecting the desired combination of genre and target age group. The research results and contents are as follows. First, rules with high reliability were calculated by generating a large number of rules using the Random Forest algorithm consisting of several decision trees. Second, the practicality of the selected rules was improved by generalizing the rules by removing unnecessary conditions in the rules. Second, practical rules were created by generalizing the rules by removing unnecessary conditions in the rules. Third, by grouping rules containing common elements, it was possible to interpret more extensively than the meaning of a single rule. Based on these research results, it is expected that the defined rules can become a cornerstone for successful film scenario construction. In addition, this study is meaningful as a convergence study of film art and data science because the organic relationship of each film element was derived through a data mining technique, Random Forest."
A customer credit Prediction Researched to Improve Credit Stability based on Artificial Intelligence,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'Lnear Regression', 'Boosted Decision Tree Regression', 'Credit loans', 'Credit Card', 'Delinquency']",,"In this Paper, Since the 1990s, Korea s credit card industry has steadily developed. As a result, various problems have arisen, such as careless customer information management and loans to low-credit customers. This, in turn, had a high delinquency rate across the card industry and a negative impact on the economy. Therefore, in this paper, based on Azure, we analyze and predict the delinquency and delinquency periods of credit loans according to gender, own car, property, number of children, education level, marital status, and employment status through linear regression analysis and enhanced decision tree algorithm. These predictions can consequently reduce the likelihood of reckless credit lending and issuance of credit cards, reducing the number of bad creditors and reducing the risk of banks. In addition, after classifying and dividing the customer base based on the predicted result, it can be used as a basis for reducing the risk of credit loans by developing a credit product suitable for each customer. The predicted result through Azure showed that when predicting with Linear Regression and Boosted Decision Tree algorithm, the Boosted Decision Tree algorithm made more accurate prediction. In addition, we intend to increase the accuracy of the analysis by assigning a number to each data in the future and predicting again."

The sample data were collected from 20 five-star hotels in Seoul and the financial ratios were extracted from 14 of these 20 hotels. First of all, the results show that the 10 financial ratios (total asset growth rate, net profit ratio of gross asset, net profit ratio of sales, gross profit ratio of sales, operating profit ratio of sales, BIS ratio, current ratio, cash ratio, fixed assets turnover, and receivable turnover) enable the top-level hotels to be discriminated from the failed hotels. Second, the AUC in the neural network was 1.000, the AUC in the SVM was 990, and the AUC in the decision tree was .812, with the highest accuracy of the neural network algorithm. Third, the prediction rate for the distress of the neural network was 100%, the prediction rate for the distress of the SVM was 90%, and the prediction rate for the distress of the decision tree was 85%. All of these algorithms had a reliability accuracy of 91.6%. According to the analysis results, hotel management needs to focus on the classification of these 10 financial ratios. Furthermore, hotels have very different financial structures and predictive indicators from other industries. In accordance with this finding, for the development of credit evaluation systems for hotels, there is a need for systems to be developed that reflect their financial features."
Applying data mining techniques for forecasting geochemical anomalies,2021,"['Forecasting anomaly', 'Data mining techniques', 'Mahalanobis distance', 'U-statistics', 'Parkam']",,"Undoubtedly, forecasting the anomalous values could play an important role in the inchoate stages of exploration. Therefore, it is essential to find the most accurate approach to separate anomalous values from background and afterward use the results to anticipate each arbitrary sample. In this study, results of a structural multivariate method (the combination of Mahalanobis distance and U-statistics algorithms) are used to distinguish anomalous values from background. Then, three data mining methods will be applied to produce practical equations and finally estimate anomalous values. Actually, at the first, separation of geochemical anomalies, based on the combination of the U-statistics and the Mahalanobis distance approaches, would be done. Afterward, three data mining methods, K nearest neighbor (K-NN), decision tree, and naïve Bayes classifier have been applied based on separation results and the other parameters – x and y coordinates and Cu and Mo grades. For this purpose, after separation of anomalous values according to the number of 377 collected surface samples from Parkam porphyry system by applying above combination, the data mining methods would be utilized to anticipate anomalous values for each unknown point. Finally, in order to judge about the designed networks, training samples would be considered as test samples under the application of the networks. Results show that the decision tree method would appear as the more powerful approach than the other due to far fewer number of wrong estimated samples and approving high accuracy of the designed network. Noteworthy is that resubstitution error for this network is noted only 0.0212 based on numbers of wrong estimated samples (8 from 377). Whereas, the numbers of wrong estimated samples for K-NN and naïve Bayes methods are, respectively, 13 and 46 and the rates of error are 0.0345 and 0.122. Moreover, it was observed that the estimated samples (the joint points of Cu and Mo) delineated by decision tree method are closely associated with the defined zone of potassic alteration in the study area. Finally, according to results, it can be said that the combination of decision tree method and the introduced anomaly separation approach could be applied as a reliable and efficient technique to approach worthwhile predictions."
Classification Model to Discriminate People with and without Pain in the Lower Back and Lower Limb using Symmetry Data,2021,"['Decision tree', 'Lower back', 'Lower limb', 'Pain', 'Symmetry']",,"Background Multiple factors are associated with lower back and lower limb (LB & LL) pain, such as impaired muscle strength, balance, endurance, and motor control, and altered movement patterns. Symmetry of motion, strength and balance are goals for rehabilitation in patients with LB & LL pain. When classifying patients before or during on- and offline assessment, it is necessary that an easy to use functional test be available for clinicians.Purpose To establish a classification tree model for discriminating people with and without LB & LL pain during walking using symmetry values from side plank endurance test, hip abductor strength test, one-leg standing time tests and walking tests.Study design Cross-sectional study Methods A total of 100 subjects with and without LB & LL pain during walking participated. We measured the side plank endurance time, hip abductor strength and one-leg standing time with eyes open and closed, and the sagittal and frontal head angles at comfortable and fast walking speeds using a wearable wireless earbud sensor and calculated the symmetry index (SI) for each test. Classification and regression tree analysis with 10-fold cross validation was used to develop the classification model.Results The classification tree had 83% accuracy for discriminating people with and without LB & LL pain during walking. The most important factor for classification was the SI of the one-leg standing time with eyes closed; the second-most important factor was the SI of the frontal head angle during fast walking.Conclusions The present classification model can differentiate people with and without LB & LL pain during walking based on symmetry data acquired during functional tests, such as one-leg standing time with the eyes closed and fast walking test using the wearable device. Based on the present results, clinicians can classify patients before and during on- and offline assessments using cutoff values of the SI of the one-leg standing test with eyes closed of 63.88%, and of frontal head motion during a fast-walking test of 63.31%."

Factors influencing disease recurrence were investigated using decision tree analysis. Methods: We analysed the records of patients who visited the Department of Periodontology, Pusan National University Dental Hospital from June 2014 to October 2019. As baseline subjects, 1,362 patients with periodontitis and who underwent full-mouth periodontal examinations before periodontal treatment were selected. Among them, 321 patients who underwent periodontal examinations after the completion of periodontal treatment and 143 who continued to participate in regular maintenance were followed-up. Results: Forty-three percent of patients had a NCD. Patients without NCDs had more residual teeth and lower sum of the number of total decayed, missing, filled teeths (DMFT) scores. There was no difference in periodontal status according to NCD status. Patients with a NCD showed significant changes in the plaque index after periodontal treatment. The decision tree model analysis demonstrated that osteoporosis affected the recurrence of periodontitis. Conclusions: The number of residual teeth and DMFT index differed according to the presence of NCDs. Patients with osteoporosis require particular attention to prevent periodontitis recurrence."

This study aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of the ESGE criteria from the perspective of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP).Methods: An ERCP database was prospectively maintained between November 2014 and December 2015 across six teaching hospitals in South Korea. The ESGE criteria (biliary cannulation time, the number of cannulation attempts, and inadvertent pancreatic duct [PD] manipulation) were recorded in this database as well as other technical factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for PEP. Then, the PEP prediction model was investigated using decision tree analysis.Results: We analyzed 1,067 consecutive patients with naïve papilla. The overall rate of PEP was 6.6%. Multivariate analysis revealed that female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.860; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.124 to 3.078), a selective biliary cannulation duration >5 minutes (OR, 3.282; 95% CI, 1.641 to 6.566), and inadvertent PD manipulation (OR, 2.614; 95% CI, 1.480 to 4.617) were significant factors affecting PEP. Decision tree analysis revealed that biliary cannulation time (χ<sup>2</sup>=49.857, p< 0.001) and inadvertent PD manipulation (χ<sup>2</sup>=8.556, p=0.010) were decisive factors. PEP occurred in 3.9%, 11.8%, and 16.2% of patients with biliary cannulation duration lasting 3 to 5 minutes, >5 minutes, and >5 minutes with inadvertent PD manipulation, respectively.Conclusions: Biliary cannulation time and inadvertent PD manipulation could be relevant indicators of PEP, and 5 minutes might be used as a cutoff value for the implementation of the rescue cannulation technique.

Recently, there is an increasing number of cases of using the accumulated big data of universities to prepare measures to fill new students. A representative example of this is the analysis of factors that affect student employment. Existing employment-influencing factor analysis studies have applied quantitative models such as regression analysis to university big data. However, since the factors affecting employment differ by major, it is necessary to reflect this. In this paper, the factors affecting employment by major are analyzed using the data of University C and the decision tree model. In addition, based on the analysis results, a roadmap for student employment by major is recommended. As a result of the experiment, four decision tree models were constructed for each major, and factors affecting employment by major and roadmap were derived."

This study used a light gradient boosting machine(LightGBM), a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm, to develop an ensemble machine learning model to predict chlorophyll-a concentration. The field water quality data observed at Daecheong Lake, obtained from the real-time water information system in Korea, were used for the development of the model. The data include temperature, pH, electric conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a. First, a LightGBM model was developed to predict the chlorophyll-a concentration by using the other seven items as independent input variables. Second, the time-lagged values of all the input variables were added as input variables to understand the effect of time lag of input variables on model performance. The time lag (i) ranges from 1 to 50 days. The model performance was evaluated using three indices, root mean squared error-observation standard deviation ration (RSR), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The model showed the best performance by adding a dataset with a one-day time lag (i=1) where RSR, NSE, and MAE were 0.359, 0.871 and 1.510, respectively. The improvement of model performance was observed when a dataset with a time lag up of about 15 days (i=15) was added."

It is essential to grasp rice cultivation areas in advance for estimating rice production of the year. This study was carried out to classify paddy rice cultivation in Gimje-si using sentinel-1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and UAV imagery in early July. Time-series Sentinel-1A and 1B images acquired from early May to early July were processed to convert into sigma naught (dB) images using SNAP (SeNtinel application platform, Version 8.0) toolbox provided by European Space Agency. Farm map and parcel map, which are spatial data of vector polygon, were used to stratify paddy field population for classifying rice paddy cultivation. To distinguish paddy rice from other crops grown in the paddy fields, we used the decision tree method using threshold levels and random forest model. Random forest model, trained by mainly rice cultivation area and rice and soybean cultivation area in UAV image area, showed the best performance as overall accuracy 89.9%, Kappa coefficient 0.774. Through this, we were able to confirm the possibility of early estimation of rice cultivation area in Gimje-si using UAV image."

In this study, a sales forecasting model is proposed for apparel products using machine learning techniques. The sales data pertaining to outerwear items for four years were collected from a Korean sports brand and filtered with outliers. Subsequently, the data were standardized by removing the effects of exogenous variables. The sales patterns of outerwear items were clustered by applying K-means clustering, and outerwear attributes associated with the specific sales-pattern type were determined by using a decision tree classifier. Six types of sales pattern clusters were derived and classified using a hybrid model of clustering and decision tree algorithm, and finally, the relationship between outerwear attributes and sales patterns was revealed.

For this purpose, data suitable for ecological analysis were collected from the 2019 Community Health Survey and Statistics Korea indicators. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were performed using the SPSS Statistics 23 to identify regional variations in high-risk drinking rates and related factors. To identify factors affecting each region, a geographic weighted regression analysis was performed using the Arc GIS. An interactive decision tree was implemented using the SAS Enterprise Miner 9.4. The analysis of factors influencing the high-risk drinking rate showed that the higher the current smoking rate, the commercial area per capita, the obesity rate, and the depression rate, the lower the park area per capita and the extent of moderate or higher physical activity, the higher the high-risk drinking rate. Based on these results, a model was developed using multiple regression analysis to support simulations at the national level and using geographic weighted regression analysis to support simulations at the city, county, and gu level. In addition, the model utilized interactive decision tree analysis to enable simulations focusing on factors that could actually be improved, and it was found that the type 1 group was 1.5 times more likely to drink than the high-risk drinking rate in a total of 228 regions.

For the understanding, this study used a survey conducted in Songjeong-dong, Seoul, where a general neighborhood urban regeneration project is being performed. The survey data which are composed of 563 samples collected for establishing urban regeneration plan show that 14.7% of the respondents have an intention to move out, despite being selected as an urban regeneration area. As a result of analyzing the samples with logistic regression and decision tree models, residents’ age, dwelling period, the degree of satisfaction with the residential environment, housing occupancy type, and cognition of urban regeneration area selection are identified to be significant factors in both models. The findings suggest that the groups with a higher intention to move out should be carefully treated when establishing an urban regeneration plan.

The decision tree, artificial neural network, support vector machine, and deep learning models were used to forecast the income and employment in Busan. The following were the main findings of the comparison of their predictive abilities. First, the decision tree models predict the income and employment well. The forecasting values for the income and employment appeared somewhat differently according to the depth of decision trees and several conditions of strategic industries as well as investment, export, and exchange rates. Second, since the artificial neural network models show that the coefficients are somewhat low and RMSE are somewhat high, these models are not good forecasting the income and employment. Third, the support vector machine models show the high predictive power with the high coefficients of determination and low RMSE. Fourth, the deep neural network models show the higher predictive power with appropriate epochs and batch sizes. Thus, since the machine learning and deep learning models can predict the employment well, we need to adopt the machine learning and deep learning models to forecast the income and employment."
Data Stream Classification Algorithms for Workload Orchestration in Vehicular Edge Computing: A Comparative Evaluation,2021,"['Online classification', 'Data stream', 'Performance', 'Ranking']",,"This paper reports on the use of online data stream classification algorithms to support workload orchestration in vehicular edge computing environments. These algorithms can be used to predict the ability of available computational nodes to successfully handle computational tasks generated from vehicular applications. Several online data stream classification algorithms have been evaluated based on synthetic datasets generated from simulated vehicular edge computing environments. In addition, a multi-criteria decision analysis technique was utilized to rank the different algorithms based on their performance metrics. The evaluation results demonstrate that the considered algorithms can handle online classification operations with various trade-offs and dominance relations with respect to their obtained performance. In addition, the utilized multi-criteria decision analysis technique can efficiently rank various algorithms and identify the most appropriate algorithms to augment workload orchestration. Furthermore, the evaluation results show that the leveraging bagging algorithm, with an extremely fast decision tree base estimator, is able to maintain marked online classification performance and persistent competitive ranking among its counterparts for all datasets. Hence, it can be considered a promising choice to reinforce workload orchestration in vehicular edge computing environments."

The Ministry of Environment has provided the level 3 land cover map(the highest (1m) spatial resolution map) with a total of 41 classes since 2010. However, specific urban green information such as street trees was identified just as grassland or even not classified them as a vegetated area in the map. Therefore, this study classified detailed urban green information(i.e., tree, shrub, and grass), not included in the existing level 3 land cover map, using two types of high-resolution(<1m) remote sensing data(i.e., airborne LiDAR and RGB ortho imagery) in Suwon, South Korea. U-Net, one of image segmentation deep learning approaches, was adopted to classify detailed urban green space. A total of three classification models(i.e., LRGB10, LRGB5, and RGB5) were proposed depending on the target number of classes and the types of input data. The average overall accuracies for test sites were 83.40% (LRGB10), 89.44%(LRGB5), and 74.76%(RGB5). Among three models, LRGB5, which uses both airborne LiDAR and RGB ortho imagery with 5 target classes(i.e., tree, shrub, grass, building, and the others), resulted in the best performance. The area ratio of total urban green space(based on trees, shrub, and grass information) for the entire Suwon was 45.61%(LRGB10), 43.47%(LRGB5), and 44.22%(RGB5). All models were able to provide additional 13.40% of urban tree information on average when compared to the existing level 3 land cover map.

Patients with BL Ames classified as low CD for both parameters of cSVA (<4 cm) and T1 slope minus cervical lordosis (TS–CL) (<15°) were excluded. Patients assessed: meeting minimum clinically important differences (MCID) for NDI (<-15 ΔNDI). Ratios of correction were found for regional parameters categorized by primary Ames driver (C or CT). Decision tree analysis assessed cutoffs for differences associated with meeting NDI MCID at 1Y.Results: Seventy-seven CD patients (mean age, 62.1 years; 64% female; body mass index, 28.8 kg/m2). Forty-one point six percent of patients met MCID for NDI. A backwards linear regression model including radiographic differences as predictors from BL to 1Y for meeting MCID for NDI demonstrated an R2 of 0.820 (p=0.032) included TS–CL, cSVA, McGregor’s slope (MGS), C2 sacral slope, C2–T3 angle, C2–T3 SVA, cervical lordosis. By primary Ames driver, 67.5% of patients were C, and 32.5% CT. Ratios of change in predictors for MCID NDI patients for C and CT were not significant between the 2 groups (p> 0.050). Decision tree analysis determined cutoffs for radiographic change, prioritizing in the following order: ≥42.5° C2–T3 angle, >35.4° cervical lordosis, <-31.76° C2 slope, <-11.57-mm cSVA, <-2.16° MGS, >-30.8-mm C2–T3 SVA, and ≤-33.6° TS–CL.Conclusion: Certain ratios of correction of cervical parameters contribute to improving neck disability.

The wireless sensor enters the sleep state at a certain interval to conserve power. The Sleep deflation attack is a deadly attack that consumes power by preventing wireless sensors from entering the sleep state, but there is no clear countermeasure. Thus, in this paper, using clustering-based binary search tree structure, the Sleep deprivation attack detection model is proposed. The model proposed in this paper utilizes one of the characteristics of both attack sensor nodes and normal sensor nodes which were classified using machine learning. The characteristics used for detection were determined using Long Short-Term Memory, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor. Thresholds for judging attack sensor nodes were then learned by applying the SVM. The determined features were used in the proposed algorithm to calculate the values for attack detection, and the threshold for determining the calculated values was derived by applying SVM. Through experiments, the detection model proposed showed a detection rate of 94% when 35% of the total sensor nodes were attack sensor nodes and improvement of up to 26% in power retention."

However, the traditional collaborative filtering technique has raised the question of having difficulty calculating the similarity for new customers or products due to the method of calculating similaritiesbased on direct connections and common features among customers. For this reason, a hybrid technique was designed to use content-based filtering techniques together. On the one hand, efforts have been made to solve these problems by applying the structural characteristics of social networks. This applies a method of indirectly calculating similarities through their similar customers placed between them. This means creating a customer’s network based on purchasing data and calculating the similarity between the two based on the features of the network that indirectly connects the two customers within this network. Such similarity can be used as a measure to predict whether the target customer accepts recommendations. The centrality metrics of networks can be utilized for the calculation of these similarities. Different centrality metrics have important implications in that they may have different effects on recommended performance. In this study, furthermore, the effect of these centrality metrics on the performance of recommendation may vary depending on recommender algorithms. In addition, recommendation techniques using network analysis can be expected to contribute to increasing recommendation performance even if they apply not only to new customers or products but also to entire customers or products. By considering a customer’s purchase of an item as a link generated between the customer and the item on the network, the prediction of user acceptance of recommendation is solved as a prediction of whether a new link will be created between them. As the classification models fit the purpose of solving the binary problem of whether the link is engaged or not, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine (SVM) are selected in the research. The data for performance evaluation used order data collected from an online shopping mall over four years and two months. Among them, the previous three years and eight months constitute social networks composed of and the experiment was conducted by organizing the data collected into the social network. The next four months’ records were used to train and evaluate recommender models. Experiments with the centrality metrics applied to each model show that the recommendation acceptance rates of the centrality metrics are different for each algorithm at a meaningful level. In this work, we analyzed only four commonly used centrality metrics: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. Eigenvector centrality records the lowest performance in all models except support vector machines. Closeness centrality and betweenness centrality show similar performance across all models. Degree centrality ranking moderate across overall models while betweenness centrality always ranking higher than degree centrality. Finally, closeness centrality is characterized by distinct differences in performance according to the model. It ranks first in logistic regression, artificial neural network, and decision tree withnumerically high performance. However, it only records very low rankings in support vector machine and K-neighborhood with low-performance levels. As the experiment results reveal, in a classification model, network centrality metrics over a subnetwork that connects the two nodes can effectively predict the connectivity between two nodes in a social network. Furthermore, each metric has a different performance depending on the classification model type. This result implie"

This program is expected to mitigate to an extent the taxi service shortage problem caused by the mismatch between taxi demands and supplies. Under this background, it is required to scrutinize citizens’ level of acceptance and their demand of the taxi-pooling services, which may guide decisions on expanding and sustaining the services. This study aims to investigate taxi passengers’ acceptance of the taxi-pooling services by employing a questionnaire-based survey targeting 1,000 Seoul citizens. The survey revealed that 16 percent of the respondents were positive about traditional taxi-pooling services and that the positive responses increased to 30.7 percent when the traditional service is changed to a platform-based one that can provide information about taxi driver and co-passengers. Ordered probit models were also developed to identify factors that affect user’s acceptance to the taxi-pooling services. The models illustrated that respondents’ background such as age, income, modes of commuting and satisfaction with taxi service are important factors. In particular, the respondents with a higher level of satisfaction with taxi services tend to more willingly accept the taxi-pooling services. A classification tree analysis was also applied to identify who are more acceptable to the taxi-pooling services when the platform-based service (under which drivers and passengers’ information are given) is introduced. It showed that 40s and 60s users who use private car, taxi and other (walk, bike etc) as modes of commuting tend to positively change their attitude toward the taxi-pooling services after the introduction of platform-based one."

Increased suspended sediment concentration (SSC) has various effects on water supply systems such as increased treatment cost and consequently, there have been various efforts to develop a model for predicting SSC. However, SSC is affected by both the natural and anthropogenic environment, making it challenging to predict SSC. Recently, advanced machine learning models have increasingly been used for water quality prediction. This study developed an ensemble machine learning model to predict SSC using the XGBoost (XGB) algorithm. The observed discharge (Q) and SSC in two fields monitoring stations were used to develop the model. The input variables were clustered in two groups with low and high ranges of Q using the k-means clustering algorithm. Then each group of data was separately used to optimize XGB (Model 1). The model performance was compared with that of the XGB model using the entire data (Model 2).

Microfinance firms have based their energies on developing rural communities and assisting individuals with financial difficulties since their conception, states, researchers, and other institutions have paid close attention to them. On the other hand, microfinance is a vulnerable market, and microcredit carries a high risk of default. These have raised the business risk for microfinance institutions. As a result, credit risk analysis of microfinance has become a pressing concern. Despite the urgency, few studies use large data sets and sophisticated methods to assess microcredit’s credit risk. Data mining techniques are a new discipline for extracting useful information from vast quantities of data. We can use them to conduct inductive reasoning and automatically classify customers’ credit risks. As a result, developing a credit risk assessment model will help microfinance companies increase personal credit risk evaluation efficiency and accuracy, service quality, and risk management capabilities. This study compares various data mining techniques and recommends the best one for analyzing microloan credit risk. To that end, we obtained 46471 loan records from a Chinese microfinance company. We used IBM SPSS Modeler 18 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 for the data analysis. The results show that the logistic regression model has the advantages of less restrictive assumptions, less necessary parameters, no strict dependent variable constraints, and clear conclusions."

Methods: CMA was performed using a decision tree model. The target populations were patients with suspected ATTR-CM. After screening of the entire target populations to rule out amyloid light-chain amyloidosis, patients were assigned to either NS followed by EMB as needed (NS group) or EMB without an NS as a gatekeeper (EMB group). We assumed that 12% of the NS group would not meet the diagnostic criteria of ATTR-CM and that these patients would still receive EMB after the NS. We calculated the costs from the healthcare system perspective using the micro-costing approach. One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results: The overall cost was estimated at 717,714 KRW per patient in the NS group and 1,425,772 KRW per patient in the EMB group. Consequently, the NS group cost 708,058 KRW less than the EMB group. The sensitivity analysis result showed that the higher the proportion of patients undergoing EMB after the NS, the lower the cost reduction effect. Conclusion: Compared to direct EMB for ATTR-CM diagnosis, selective EMB after NS reduces the overall costs in Korea."

As a result of the experiment, it can be seen that there is a difference in classification according to the characteristics of using the same voice, and in the case of a situation in which the sound is unified, such as ‘cough,’ the judgment of any classifier is clear. However, in other situations, it is considered necessary to consider the characteristics of pigs by further observing their socialization behavior."

Thus, prediction of turbid water is essential for water environmental management. Recently, various advanced machine learning algorithms have been increasingly used in water environmental management. Ensemble machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) are some of the most popular machine learning algorithms used for water environmental management, along with deep learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks. In this study GBDT, an ensemble machine learning algorithm, and gated recurrent unit (GRU), a recurrent neural networks algorithm, are used for model development to predict turbidity in a river. The observation frequencies of input data used for the model were 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 120 and 168 h. The root-mean-square error-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) of GRU and GBDT ranges between 0.182~0.766 and 0.400~0.683, respectively. Both models show similar prediction accuracy with RSR of 0.682 for GRU and 0.683 for GBDT. The GRU shows better prediction accuracy when the observation frequency is relatively short (i.e., 2, 4, and 8 h) where GBDT shows better prediction accuracy when the observation frequency is relatively long (i.e. 48, 120, 160 h). The results suggest that the characteristics of input data should be considered to develop an appropriate model to predict turbidity."

Therefore, we developed a prediction model for self-employed business closure in 25 autonomous districts in Seoul by using three machine learning methods (decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine). To this end, the open commercial district data of ‘Our Village Shop Commercial Area Analysis Service’ operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government was utilized. First, as a result of analyzing the predictive performance of business closure, the random forest model was the highest for the service industry and the support vector machine model was the highest for the catering industry. Subsequently, the factors that have the most influencing on the business closure prediction model were the surviving population by building unit, average operating period, and rent in the case of the service industry, and rent, the number of households, and the surviving population by building in the catering business. Through this, new self-employed persons can grasp the characteristics of the commercial district they want to enter and build a survival strategy appropriate for them, and local governments and governments can use them as indicators of support policies such as sales strategy consulting and capacity building for existing self-employed persons. This study is significant in that it has shown the potential to predict the closure of self-employed people by using representative machine learning techniques and by using easily collected data alone. It is also meaningful in that it derived direct and quantitative decision indicators for self-employed businesses."

Forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic situation of Korea,2021,"['COVID-19', 'deep learning', 'disease transmission', 'mathematical model', 'pandemics', 'statistical model']",,"For the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), predictive modeling, in the literature, uses broadly susceptible exposed infected recoverd (SEIR)/SIR, agent-based, curve-fitting models. Governments and legislative bodies rely on insights from prediction models to suggest new policies and to assess the effectiveness of enforced policies. Therefore, access to accurate outbreak prediction models is essential to obtain insights into the likely spread and consequences of infectious diseases. The objective of this study is to predict the future COVID-19 situation of Korea. Here, we employed 5 models for this analysis; SEIR, local linear regression (LLR), negative binomial (NB) regression, segment Poisson, deep-learning based long short-term memory models (LSTM) and tree based gradient boosting machine (GBM). After prediction, model performance comparison was evelauated using relative mean squared errors (RMSE) for two sets of train (January 20, 2020-December 31, 2020 and January 20, 2020-January 31, 2021) and testing data (January 1, 2021-February 28, 2021 and February 1, 2021-February 28, 2021) . Except for segmented Poisson model, the other models predicted a decline in the daily confirmed cases in the country for the coming future. RMSE values' comparison showed that LLR, GBM, SEIR, NB, and LSTM respectively, performed well in the forecasting of the pandemic situation of the country. A good understanding of the epidemic dynamics would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Therefore, with increasing daily confirmed cases since this year, these results could help in the pandemic response by informing decisions about planning, resource allocation, and decision concerning social distancing policies."

PM10 예측 성능 향상을 위한 이진 분류 모델 비교 분석,2021,,,"High forecast accuracy is required as social issues on particulate matter increase. Therefore, many attempts are being made using machine learning to increase the accuracy of particulate matter prediction. However, due to problems with the distribution of imbalance in the concentration and various characteristics of particulate matter, the learning of prediction models is not well done. In this paper, to solve these problems, a binary classification model was proposed to predict the concentration of particulate matter needed for prediction by dividing it into two classes based on the value of 80㎍/㎥. Four classification algorithms were utilized for the binary classification of PM10. Classification algorithms used logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, and MLP. As a result of performance evaluation through confusion matrix, the MLP model showed the highest binary classification performance with 89.98% accuracy among the four models."

Method: Technical statistical analysis was conducted to analyze the trend of performance factors for 10 years from 2011 to 2020. Also, the independent sample t -test was conducted to verify differences between winners and non-winners. Lastly, the decision tree analysis was used to verify performance factors affecting the winning probability.  Results: Players in the top 60th in the LPGA’s prize money ranking steadily had improved their performance factors over the past 10 years. Those who had winning experiences differed significantly in scoring average, driving distance, driving accuracy, greens in regulation, putting average, and saves, birdies, eagles, and rounds in the 60’s. The factors that determined the winning were driving accuracy, greens in regulation, putting average, and scoring average.  Conclusion: In order to achieve good performance in the LPGA, training to increase the birdies would be necessary. Also, unlike in the past, training to increase driving accuracy would be necessary. This implies that short game capability can be a direct factor for winning than power game capability in the future.

Detection of Atrial Fibrillation in Short-Lead Electrocardiogram Recordings Obtained using a Smart Scale,2021,,,"Atrial fi brillation (AF) is the type of arrhythmia that raises possibility of severe health problems such as heart failure and stroke and it is known that a major risk factor of AF includes overweight and obesity. Based on this association between such health-related indicators, we propose a smart scale that is capable of measuring weight and electrocardiography (ECG) simultaneously. The scale was developed using Arduino Uno, a Wheatstone bridge load cell, and ECG sensors. The ECG signals were processed to compute heart rate (in other words, RR interval). The smart scale was evaluated with four healthy volunteers in terms of reliability showing high agreement with a commercial device for ECG monitoring. In addition, it implements Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection using machine-learning classifi ers including a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method, a Decision Tree (DT), and a Neural Network (NN) on relatively short recordings of ECG obtained while using the scale. The root mean square of the successive diff erences between heart beats (RMSSD) and the Shannon entropy of the RR interval (ECG features) were extracted from ECG signals for AF detection. Performance of AF detection was tested with patients who were treated at a Cardiology Center after balancing data by applying over- and under-sampling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and the Tomek Link (T-Link) algorithm. After addressing the data imbalance, the AF detection performance of each classifi er (kNN, DT, and NNs) was 98.9%, 97.8%, and 98.9% respectively. This work has successfully demonstrated weight and cardio activity monitoring features while using a scale that may help keep the records of sensitive health related indexes on a daily basis."

Our research method suggests a novel approach for analyzing the quality of scientific argumentation in classrooms."
Sub-level Classification and Prediction System of Fully Weathered Red Sandstone Rock Mass Based on Physical Property Indices,2021,"['Fully weathered red sandstone', 'Physical property indices', 'Stability evaluation', 'Sub-level classification', 'Prediction system']",,"This paper intends to obtain a sub-level classification of fully weathered red sandstone rock mass during the Cretaceous period based on physical property indices. An automatic prediction system for mechanical properties of rock mass is also established in which the values of rock mass grade and mechanical properties can be returned when physical indices are given. In this study, water content, relative compaction, and fine content, which are relatively easy to measure on tunnel sites, are selected as physical property indices, while cohesion, internal friction angle, and compression modulus, which affect mechanical strength, are taken as mechanical indices. For the convenience of analysis, rock mass of different physical states is divided into 18 different combinations based on the results of lab tests and rock mass stability of each state is evaluated using a stability evaluation criterion we put forward. The numerical simulation of tunnel excavation is further carried out for determining the sub-level classification.

However, regarding the domestic crime prediction research using machine learning, the current related studies are insufficient because disclosure of crime data is restricted and most of these studies predicted crimes by using a wide range of analysis units or by focusing on a few variables. To effectively distribute police power through practical crime prediction, it is necessary to predict the time and place of the crime. Therefore, in this study, we train machine learning models with 9,413 instances of actual theft crime data having temporal-spatial elements such as crime time and date, buildings, land-use, and CCTV. Thereby, we intend to provide a basis for future research and assist crime prevention activities practically by comparing the results of the prediction models. In this study, we divided the target land into 100 m square grids by using GIS and then inserted crime and temporal-spatial related variables. Subsequently, we trained the typical machine learning models such as random forest, decision trees, SVC, and K-NN, conducted crime prediction, and compared the results of the models. In the case of crime data, generally, an excessive amount of unbalanced data is present for the places where crimes did not occur compared to places where crimes occurred. Unbalanced data can result in noise and cause inaccurate predictions-these issues must be addressed. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a resampling method as an alternative to solve data imbalances and provide crime prediction with improved accuracy. The results of the comparison of the prediction performance of the models showed that the F1 score of the random forest model using the SMOTE method was high. This could be because the data loss of the SMOTE method is less than that of the under-sampling method and the random forest as an ensemble type model has an advantage in predicting data with various variables. We compared the influence of each variable by employing the feature importance function. Overall, the temporal-related variables showed high influence-among them, crimes occurred within one month showed the highest influence. Among the physical environment-related variables, first neighborhood living facility, retail store, and detached house were found to have high influence."

In this study, we investigate the effects of the sEMG-signal sampling rate and feature extraction window length on the classification accuracy in hand-motion recognition. Ten normal subjects and one forearm amputee were made to wear an armband module consisting of eight EMG sensors, and seven and four hand movements of the normal subjects and amputee, respectively, were measured. The EMG signal was measured at 500 Hz and down-sampled to 250, 100, and 50 Hz. Four time-domain features (mean average value, waveform length, zero crossing, and slope sign change) were calculated as the sEMG features with six selected window lengths, which were increased in 50 ms intervals (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 ms). Hand-motion recognition was performed using artificial neural network, support vector machine, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Our results showed that for all classifiers and all subjects, the hand-motion classification accuracy increases with an increase in the sampling rate and window length. We believe that our findings will aid in selecting the appropriate sampling rate and window length for prosthetics meant for daily use."

"국고채, 금리 스왑 그리고 통화 스왑 가격에 기반한 외환시장 환율예측 연구: 인공지능 활용의 실증적 증거",2021,"['지식경영', '인공신경망', '달러원환율', 'Knowledge management', 'Artificial neural network', 'USDKRW', 'CCS', 'KTB']",,"The purpose of this study is to find out which artificial intelligence methodology is most suitable for creating a foreign exchange rate prediction model using the indicators of bond market and interest rate market. KTBs and MSBs, which are representative products of the Korea bond market, are sold on a large scale when a risk aversion occurs, and in such cases, the USD/KRW exchange rate often rises. When USD liquidity problems occur in the onshore Korean market, the KRW Cross-Currency Swap price in the interest rate market falls, then it plays as a signal to buy USD/KRW in the foreign exchange market. Considering that the price and movement of products traded in the bond market and interest rate market directly or indirectly affect the foreign exchange market, it may be regarded that there is a close and complementary relationship among the three markets. There have been studies that reveal the relationship and correlation between the bond market, interest rate market, and foreign exchange market, but many exchange rate prediction studies in the past have mainly focused on studies based on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, current account surplus/deficit, and inflation while active research to predict the exchange rate of the foreign exchange market using artificial intelligence based on the bond market and interest rate market indicators has not been conducted yet. This study uses the bond market and interest rate market indicator, runs artificial neural network suitable for nonlinear data analysis, logistic regression suitable for linear data analysis, and decision tree suitable for nonlinear & linear data analysis, and proves that the artificial neural network is the most suitable methodology for predicting the foreign exchange rates which are nonlinear and times series data. Beyond revealing the simple correlation between the bond market, interest rate market, and foreign exchange market, capturing the trading signals between the three markets to reveal the active correlation and prove the mutual organic movement is not only to provide foreign exchange market traders with a new trading model but also to be expected to contribute to increasing the efficiency and the knowledge management of the entire financial market."

A total of 3,526 tunnels have been constructed in Korea and the associated techniques in tunnel design and construction have been continuously developed, however, not many studies have been performed on how to assess rock mass quality and grade more accurately. Thus, numerous cases show big differences in the results according to inspectors' experience and judgement. Hence, this study aims to suggest a more reliable rock mass classification (RMR) model using machine learning algorithms, which is surging in availability, through the analyses based on various rock and rock mass information collected from boring investigations. For this, 11 learning parameters (depth, rock type, RQD, electrical resistivity, UCS, V<sub>p</sub>, V<sub>s</sub>, Young's modulus, unit weight, Poisson's ratio, RMR) from 13 local tunnel cases were selected, 337 learning data sets as well as 60 test data sets were prepared, and 6 machine learning algorithms (DT, SVM, ANN, PCA & ANN, RF, XGBoost) were tested for various hyperparameters for each algorithm. The results show that the mean absolute errors in RMR value from five algorithms except Decision Tree were less than 8 and a Support Vector Machine model is the best model. The applicability of the model, established through this study, was confirmed and this prediction model can be applied for more reliable rock mass classification when additional various data is continuously cumulated."
Feature Extraction and Evaluation for Classification Models of Injurious Falls Based on Surface Electromyography,2021,"['Classification', 'Datamining', 'Electromyography', 'Falls', 'Injurious falls', 'Muscle activation']",,"Background: Only 2% of falls in older adults result in serious injuries (i.e., hip fracture). Therefore, it is important to differentiate injurious versus non-injurious falls, which is critical to develop effective interventions for injury prevention. Objects: The purpose of this study was to a. extract the best features of surface electromy-ography (sEMG) for classification of injurious falls, and b. find a best model provided by data mining techniques using the extracted features.Methods: Twenty young adults self-initiated falls and landed sideways. Falling trials were consisted of three initial fall directions (forward, sideways, or backward) and three knee po-sitions at the time of hip impact (the impacting-side knee contacted the other knee (“knee together”) or the mat (“knee on mat”), or neither the other knee nor the mat was contacted by the impacting-side knee (“free knee”). Falls involved “backward initial fall direction” or “free knee” were defined as “injurious falls” as suggested from previous studies. Nine features were extracted from sEMG signals of four hip muscles during a fall, including integral of absolute value (IAV), Wilson amplitude (WAMP), zero crossing (ZC), number of turns (NT), mean of am-plitude (MA), root mean square (RMS), average amplitude change (AAC), difference absolute standard deviation value (DASDV). The decision tree and support vector machine (SVM) were used to classify the injurious falls. Results: For the initial fall direction, accuracy of the best model (SVM with a DASDV) was 48%. For the knee position, accuracy of the best model (SVM with an AAC) was 49%. Further-more, there was no model that has sensitivity and specificity of 80% or greater.Conclusion: Our results suggest that the classification model built upon the sEMG features of the four hip muscles are not effective to classify injurious falls. Future studies should con-sider other data mining techniques with different muscles."

In this study, the method of using the discrete wavelet transform is introduced to the classification problem of time series data and applied to actual data analysis. Discrete wavelet transform is an advanced form of Fourier analysis that does not contain time information, and has the advantage of simultaneously increasing temporal resolution and frequency resolution, so it is effective in the classification problem of non-stationary time series data.

머신러닝을 활용한 자동차 시트용 폴리우레탄 발포공정의 불량 예측 모델 개발,2021,"['Smart Factory', 'Foaming Process', 'Machine Learning', 'Defect Prediction', '4th Industrial Revolution']","최근 4차 산업혁명으로 인해 제조업계에서는 제조업의 인공지능을 접목시켜 효율성을 극대화하는 스마트 팩토리붐이 일어나고 있다. 특히 자동차 부품 제조 및 생산에 널리 적용되어 불량을 낮추는 연구들이 활발히 진행되고 있다. 이에 본 연구에서는 머신러닝을 통한 불량예측을 시트 폼 발포공정에 접목시켜 발포공정의 효율성을 극대화하는 연구를 진행하였다. 자동차 시트폼 에서 주로 사용되는 폴리우레탄 폼(polyurethane foam)은 폴리올(polyol, 이하 POL)과 이소시아네이트(isocyanate, 이하 ISO)를 혼합 및 발포하는 공정으로 제조되며, 각 원료의 혼합비율과 온도의 변화에 따라 제품의 특성이 변화한다. 이에 본 연구에서는 발포공정에서 수집되는 인자별 데이터값을 머신러닝에 적용하여 불량을 예측하고자 한다. 머신러닝에 사용되는 알고리즘으로는 의사결정트리, kNN, 앙상블 알고리즘을 사용하였으며 학습은 5,147개의 데이터를 사용하였으며, 학습된 결과를 1,000개의 검증용 데이터에 적용한 결과, 세 알고리즘 중 앙상블 알고리즘에서 최대 98.5 %의 정확도를 확인할 수 있었다. 이러한 결과를 통해 발포공정에서 실시간으로 수집되는 데이터를 통해 현재 생산되는 부품의 불량 여부를 확인할 수 있으며, 나아가 각 인자를 조절하여 불량률을 개선할 수 있음을 짐작할 수 있다고 사료된다.","With recent developments in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the manufacturing industry has changed rapidly. Through key aspects of Fourth Industrial Revolution super-connections and super-intelligence, machine learning will be able to make fault predictions during the foam-making process. Polyol and isocyanate are components in polyurethane foam. There has been a lot of research that could affect the characteristics of the products, depending on the specific mixture ratio and temperature. Based on these characteristics, this study collects data from each factor during the foam-making process and applies them to machine learning in order to predict faults. The algorithms used in machine learning are the decision tree, kNN, and an ensemble algorithm, and these algorithms learn from 5,147 cases. Based on 1,000 pieces of data for validation, the learning results show up to 98.5% accuracy using the ensemble algorithm. Therefore, the results confirm the faults of currently produced parts by collecting real-time data from each factor during the foam-making process. Furthermore, control of each of the factors may improve the fault rate."
Fire-Risk Prediction Based on Weather Information by Classification of Fire Investigation Information,2021,"['Fire safety', 'Weather conditions', 'Risk prediction', 'Fire type', 'Source of ignition', 'Cause of ignition', 'Ignition material']","화재 안전을 위해서, 화재 발생을 방지하는 것이 가장 근본적인 방법이다. 기상의 변화는 인간의 생활의 변화와 밀접한 관계가 있고, 기상 변화에 따른 화재 발생 예측은 화재 예방을 위해 많은 기여를 할 수 있을 것이다 . 본 연구에서는 예측 기술을 활용하여 기상의 변화에 따른 화재 발생의 변화를 분석하고자 한다. 예측 모델은 온도, 습도, 풍속, 지역의 4가지 입력 변수를 기반으로 하였다. 이러한 기상 조건을 기반으로 화재 유형, 발화원, 발화 원인 및 발화 물질과 같은 여러 화재 특성에 대한 화재 위험 예측 정확도를 확인하였다. 분석을 위해 ‘인구 시간당 화재 발생 빈도’를 산출하고 이를 위험등급으로 구분하는 데이터 전처리를 하였고, 인공신경망과 의사결정트리를 활용한 화재 예측 모형을 만들었다. 분석 결과 세부 변수별 화재 위험도의 예측 정확도를 비교하였고 기상과 연관성이 높은 특정유형의 화재를 확인하였다. 본 연구는 기상 조건에 따라 화재 발생 위험이 높은 세부 특성을 파악하고 추후 화재 특성별 위험도를 도출하기 위한 기초자료로 활용 가능할 것이다.","For fire safety, preventing the occurrence of a fire is the most fundamental method. Changes in weather are closely related to changes in human life, and prediction of fire occurrence according to changes in weather can make a great contribution to fire prevention. This study intends to analyze the change in fire occurrence according to the change of weather by using the prediction technology. The prediction model’s results were based on 4 input variables (temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and region); it measured the fire-risk prediction accuracy for several fire characteristics such as fire type, ignition source, ignition cause, and ignition material based on those weather conditions. For the analysis, data pre-processing was performed to calculate the ‘population frequency of fires per hour’ and classify them into risk grades, and the fire prediction model using artificial neural networks and decision trees was created. As a result of the analysis, the prediction accuracy of the fire risk for each detailed variable was compared, and a specific type of fire highly related to the weather was identified. This study can be used as basic data to identify detailed fire characteristics with a high risk of fire depending on weather conditions and to derive the risk level for each fire characteristic in the future."
『북상기(北廂記)』에 나타난 하위주체 여성의 욕망과 창작 의도,2021,"['북상기', '기생', '하위주체 여성', '욕망', '창작 의도', 'Buksangki', '北廂記', 'gisaeng', '妓生', 'a subject of the lower class woman', 'desire', 'creative intentions']",,"The purpose of this article is to shed light on the author's creative intentions by specifically reviewing the belief and desire of a woman who is a subject of the lower class in Buksangki(北廂記). In the meantime, Buksangki was regarded as a work that stands at the pinnacle of 19th century sex literature, and was discussed around the sexual desire and sexual discourse of the characters. However, many parts of the work were overlooked while focusing on sex discourse. So in this article by examining the central figures and events rather than the sex discourse itself, I intended to identify the writer's intention to express the desire of the subject of the lower class woman as the central narrative of the work.Buksangki is a work in which Gisaeng(妓生) Sun-ok(舜玉) set an aim in life as I won't serve two men and had self-realized her desire. The central narrative of this story is about a subject of the lower class woman who desires the life of the ordinary woman in spite of a gisaeng herself and tries to confirm her identity through the realization of her desire. Of course, Sun-ok's belief and desire repeatedly run into difficulties. Nevertheless, Sun-ok constantly tries not to lose his identity. She finally embodies her desire by removing her status as a giseang through the Chim Seon-bi(針線婢) event and gaining sympathy and support from people around her through the Nak-an(樂安)'s betting Baduk event.The author, DongKoEoCho(東皐魚樵) who paid attention to the narrative of Sunok's desire seems to have been a classical scholar who devoted his whole life to learning. However, he lived in a remote countryside and was not recognized by others, and in his later years, he is presumed to be a Yangban(兩班) of the collapsing family who hid his tracks among people who gather trees and fish(the common people). The writer seems to have shown his bad situation and his convictions allegorically through Sun-ok's story, which has been preserved without breaking his original decision despite many twists and turns as a gisaeng who cannot live his life independently.As the preceding study also revealed, Buksangki is a work that showed the scene of sexual discourse in the 19th century and strengthened interest and entertainment through unconventional settings and sexually specific depictions, including scenes of sexual intercourse between 18-year-old gisaeng and 61-year-old elderly person. However, as a result of re-examining the central narrative and creative intentions of the work, I revealed that the author created the work not only to capture the social conditions or sexual customs of the time, but to emphasize the importance of keeping the original meaning even if it is not recognized by others. This discussion of the research will provide an opportunity to adjust the previous perspective of viewing Buksangki as a sexual play."

Additionally, this paper analyzed whether the nationality of the international students in Busan, South Korea, have an influence on these factors. First of all, in the case of China, we discovered that all independent variables have statistically meaningful positive impact/influence on their buying intention for Korean foods. In terms of the regression coefficient from the effectiveness of each variable’s perspective, Desire was the most effective, followed by SN, AB, and PBC. Secondly, in the case of Vietnam, it also showed that all independent variables have statistically meaningful positive influence on their buying intention for Korean foods. The value of the regression coefficient was significantly different, still making the Desire as the most effective independent variable but the rest in the order of PBC, SN, and AB. Lastly, as a result of the decision tree analysis, the most impactful variable for the behavioral intention was Desire, followed by PBC, AB, SN for China. For Vietnam, it was desire, followed by PBC, SN, and AB."
