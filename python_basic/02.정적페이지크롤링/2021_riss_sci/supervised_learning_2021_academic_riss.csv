Attentive Transfer Learning via Self-supervised Learning for Cervical Dysplasia Diagnosis,2021,"['Attention Learning', 'Cervical Dysplasia', 'Patch self-supervised Learning', 'Transfer Learning']",,"Many deep learning approaches have been studied for image classification in computer vision. However, there are not enough data to generate accurate models in medical fields, and many datasets are not annotated. This study presents a new method that can use both unlabeled and labeled data. The proposed method is applied to classify cervix images into normal versus cancerous, and we demonstrate the results. First, we use a patch selfsupervised learning for training the global context of the image using an unlabeled image dataset. Second, we generate a classifier model by using the transferred knowledge from self-supervised learning. We also apply attention learning to capture the local features of the image. The combined method provides better performance than state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and sensitivity."
A Hybrid Recommendation System based on Fuzzy C-Means Clustering and Supervised Learning,2021,"['Recommendation', 'Collaborative filtering', 'Clustering', 'Supervised learning']",,"A recommendation system is an information filter tool, which uses the ratings and reviews of users to generate a personalized recommendation service for users. However, the cold-start problem of users and items is still a major research hotspot on service recommendations. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a high-efficient hybrid recommendation system based on Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering and supervised learning models. The proposed recommendation method includes two aspects: on the one hand, FCM clustering technique has been applied to the item-based collaborative filtering framework to solve the cold start problem; on the other hand, the content information is integrated into the collaborative filtering. The algorithm constructs the user and item membership degree feature vector, and adopts the data representation form of the scoring matrix to the supervised learning algorithm, as well as by combining the subjective membership degree feature vector and the objective membership degree feature vector in a linear combination, the prediction accuracy is significantly improved on the public datasets with different sparsity. The efficiency of the proposed system is illustrated by conducting several experiments on MovieLens dataset."
Supervised learning in a spiking neural network,2021,['Spiking neural network · Neural network learning · Free energy and charge conservation principles'],,"We introduce a method to train a bio-inspired neural network model, having the characteristics of spiking-timing-dependent interaction and learning, in a manner of supervised learning. We assume the spiking neural network model has the tendency to obey the charge conservation principle or the junction rule on a long (or the learning dynamics) time scale. The tendency makes the distribution of connectivities is determined depending on not only the incoming stimuli to input neurons but also the outgoing stimuli from output neurons as if a solution of the finite elementary method in a fluid system. We apply the learning method to several cases in simulations and find the adoption of the conservation principle exerts desired effects on the neural network learning. Finally, we discuss the significance and the drawbacks of the introduced method and compare it with the supervised learning method implemented by the artificial neural network model."
Supervised learning에 기반한 돼지 발성음 분류에 관한 연구,2021,"['Pig', 'Sound', 'Classification', 'Analysis', 'Situation judgment', 'Supervised learning']",,"This study categorizes the current situation of the pig as supervised learning through the analysis of the pig’s sound. Audio data were obtained from video data obtained by recording at a barn. Speech data was preprocessed to extract features in the time domain and frequency domain, and formants and MFCC were extracted in the frequency domain. Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine were used for classification, and linear and RBF kernels were used for SVM. The experiment was conducted two times: classifying using features used in Praat and MDVP, which are speech analysis programs, and classifying using MFCC used in speech recognition. After classification, k-fold verification was performed. As a result of the experiment, it can be seen that there is a difference in classification according to the characteristics of using the same voice, and in the case of a situation in which the sound is unified, such as ‘cough,’ the judgment of any classifier is clear. However, in other situations, it is considered necessary to consider the characteristics of pigs by further observing their socialization behavior."
A Knowledge Extraction Pipeline between Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Using Gaussian Mixture Models for Anomaly Detection,2021,"['Classification', 'Clustering', 'Association rules', 'Knowledge extraction', 'Swarm intelligence']",,"This paper presents a new approach to design a decision support model with suitability across various contexts, and in particular for the Internet of Things. It provides an anomaly detection-learning model that is adapted to the patient""s medical condition. A highly balanced artificial intelligence based on a Gaussian mixture model and association rules leverages the knowledge acquired through cross-referencing supervised and unsupervised machine learning. This process ensures an unsupervised cluster-based model, to accurately classify medical inputs according to their risk level and provide a knowledge extraction bridge between the supervised and unsupervised aspects of the data, thereby enhancing the medical decision-making process to be data-driven and therefore case-specific."

Supervised learning and frequency domain averaging‐based adaptive channel estimation scheme for filterbank multicarrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation,2021,"['channel estimation', 'FBMC‐OQAM', 'frequency domain averaging', 'k‐nearest neighbors', 'supervised machine learning']",,"Filterbank multicarrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC‐OQAM) is an attractive alternative to the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique. In comparison with OFDM, the FBMC‐OQAM signal has better spectral confinement and higher spectral efficiency and tolerance to synchronization errors, primarily due to per‐subcarrier filtering using a frequency‐time localized prototype filter. However, the filtering process introduces intrinsic interference among the symbols and complicates channel estimation (CE). An efficient way to improve the CE in FBMC‐OQAM is using a technique known as windowed frequency domain averaging (FDA); however, it requires a priori knowledge of the window length parameter which is set based on the channel's frequency selectivity (FS). As the channel's FS is not fixed and not a priori known, we propose a k‐nearest neighbor‐based machine learning algorithm to classify the FS and decide on the FDA's window length. A comparative theoretical analysis of the mean‐squared error (MSE) is performed to prove the proposed CE scheme's effectiveness, validated through extensive simulations. The adaptive CE scheme is shown to yield a reduction in CE‐MSE and improved bit error rates compared with the popular preamble‐based CE schemes for FBMC‐OQAM, without a priori knowledge of channel's frequency selectivity."

Mining transcriptome data to identify genes and pathways related to lemon taste using supervised and unsupervised data learning methods,2021,"['Attribute weighting algorithms', 'Citrus limon', 'Hierarchical clustering', 'Microarray analysis', 'Principal component analysis', 'Taste']",,"There is a dearth of studies on the genes engaged in citrus taste. Unraveling the major genes involved in pathways related to the taste of citrus (sweet or acidic) is highly important for developing new genotypes with favorable taste. Pivotal genes linked to citrus taste can be extracted through mining a large number of expression data. To attain this objective, 10 different attribute weighting algorithms (AWAs) were applied on the expression data from three lemon (Citrus limon) genotypes differing in terms of fruit acidity. As a result, a total of 170 probe sets were identified by more than eight AWAs as the most discriminative probe sets. Subsequently, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering heatmaps were implemented for validation of the 170 top-ranked probe sets. Noticeably, the identified top 170 probe sets significantly contributed to accurate discrimination between sweet and acidic lemon samples, which indicate the significance and accuracy of prediction of probe sets. According to the results, some genes like citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, proton-pumping ATPase, and flavanone 3-hydroxylase had distinct roles in differentiation of the studied genotypes and acidity. Among all of the genes, malate dehydrogenase was the most informative. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on identifying the most important genes contributing to lemon taste using supervised and unsupervised data learning methods."
Semi-Supervised Spatial Attention Method for Facial Attribute Editing,2021,"['Facial attribute editing', 'spatial attention mechanism', 'semi-supervised learning', 'generative adversarial network', 'STGAN']",,"In recent years, facial attribute editing has been successfully used to effectively change face images of various attributes based on generative adversarial networks and encoder-decoder models. However, existing models have a limitation in that they may change an unintended part in the process of changing an attribute or may generate an unnatural result. In this paper, we propose a model that improves the learning of the attention mask by adding a spatial attention mechanism based on the unified selective transfer network (referred to as STGAN) using semi-supervised learning. The proposed model can edit multiple attributes while preserving details independent of the attributes being edited. This study makes two main contributions to the literature. First, we propose an encoder-decoder model structure that learns and edits multiple facial attributes and suppresses distortion using an attention mask. Second, we define guide masks and propose a method and an objective function that use the guide masks for multiple facial attribute editing through semi-supervised learning. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the experimental results, the proposed method was proven to yield improved results that preserve the image details by suppressing unintended changes than existing methods."
Self-Supervised Long-Short Term Memory Network for Solving Complex Job Shop Scheduling Problem,2021,"['Job Shop Scheduling Problem', 'JSSP', 'LSTM', 'Smart Factory', 'ICONI 2020']",,"The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) plays a critical role in smart manufacturing, an effective JSSP scheduler could save time cost and increase productivity. Conventional methods are very time-consumption and cannot deal with complicated JSSP instances as it uses one optimal algorithm to solve JSSP. This paper proposes an effective scheduler based on deep learning technology named self-supervised long-short term memory (SS-LSTM) to handle complex JSSP accurately. First, using the optimal method to generate sufficient training samples in small-scale JSSP. SS-LSTM is then applied to extract rich feature representations from generated training samples and decide the next action. In the proposed SS-LSTM, two channels are employed to reflect the full production statues. Specifically, the detailed-level channel records 18 detailed product information while the system-level channel reflects the type of whole system states identified by the k-means algorithm. Moreover, adopting a self-supervised mechanism with LSTM autoencoder to keep high feature extraction capacity simultaneously ensuring the reliable feature representative ability. The authors implemented, trained, and compared the proposed method with the other leading learning-based methods on some complicated JSSP instances. The experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness and priority of the proposed method for solving complex JSSP instances in terms of make-span."
Semi-supervised Software Defect Prediction Model Based on Tri-training,2021,"['Feature Normalization', 'Oversampling Techniques', 'Software Defect Prediction', 'Semi-supervised Learning', 'Unbalanced Classification']",,"Aiming at the problem of software defect prediction difficulty caused by insufficient software defect marker samples and unbalanced classification, a semi-supervised software defect prediction model based on a tri-training algorithm was proposed by combining feature normalization, over-sampling technology, and a Tri-training algorithm. First, the feature normalization method is used to smooth the feature data to eliminate the influence of too large or too small feature values on the model's classification performance. Secondly, the oversampling method is used to expand and sample the data, which solves the unbalanced classification of labelled samples. Finally, the Tri-training algorithm performs machine learning on the training samples and establishes a defect prediction model. The novelty of this model is that it can effectively combine feature normalization, oversampling techniques, and the Tri-training algorithm to solve both the under-labelled sample and class imbalance problems. Simulation experiments using the NASA software defect prediction dataset show that the proposed method outperforms four existing supervised and semi-supervised learning in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-Measure values."
Self-Supervised Rigid Registration for Small Images,2021,"['Rigid Registration', 'Self-Supervised Learning', 'Small Image', 'LSTM', 'Homography Estimation']",,"For small image registration, feature-based approaches are likely to fail as feature detectors cannot detect enough feature points from low-resolution images. The classic FFT approach’s prediction accuracy is high, but the registration time can be relatively long, about several seconds to register one image pair. To achieve real-time and high-precision rigid registration for small images, we apply deep neural networks for supervised rigid transformation prediction, which directly predicts the transformation parameters. We train deep registration models with rigidly transformed CIFAR-10 images and STL-10 images, and evaluate the generalization ability of deep registration models with transformed CIFAR-10 images, STL-10 images, and randomly generated images. Experimental results show that the deep registration models we propose can achieve comparable accuracy to the classic FFT approach for small CIFAR-10 images (32×32) and our LSTM registration model takes less than 1ms to register one pair of images. For moderate size STL-10 images (96×96), FFT significantly outperforms deep registration models in terms of accuracy but is also considerably slower. Our results suggest that deep registration models have competitive advantages over conventional approaches, at least for small images."

However, it is not possible to develop high efficiency HEVs without an effective energy management system (EMS), a well-designed EMS is vital in HEVs because they need to manage two power sources. Motivated by this, there are continuing efforts being made to research and establish suitable energy management strategies in order to develop high efficiency HEVs. In the past, many energy management strategies for HEVs were developed based on optimal control theory. Recently, various kinds of machine learning technologies have been applied to HEV EMS development based on breakthroughs in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning is a field of research that allows computers to perform arbitrary tasks guided by data rather than explicit programming. Machine learning can be classified into supervised learning, reinforcement learning (semi-supervised learning), and unsupervised learning depending on how the training data is structured. In this study, we look at cases and studies in which machine learning techniques from each category were used to develop HEV energy management strategies."

Scalable supervised online hashing for image retrieval,2021,"['online hashing', 'image retrieval', 'scalable supervised learning']",,"Online hashing methods aim to learn compact binary codes of the new data stream, and update the hash function to renew the codes of the existing data. However, the addition of new data streams has a vital impact on the retrieval performance of the entire retrieval system, especially the similarity measurement between new data streams and existing data, which has always been one of the focuses of online retrieval research. In this paper, we present a novel scalable supervised online hashing method, to solve the above problems within a unified framework. Specifically, the similarity matrix is established by the label matrix of the existing data and the new data stream. The projection of the existing data label matrix is then used as an intermediate term to approximate the binary codes of the existing data, which not only realizes the semantic information of the hash codes learning but also effectively alleviates the problem of data imbalance. In addition, an alternate optimization algorithm is proposed to efficiently make the solution of the model. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets validate its superior performance over several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and scalability for online retrieval task."

As traditional microbiological susceptibility testing requires at least 24 hours, automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques could be used as clinical decision support tools to predict antimicrobial resistance and select appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment. Methods: An antimicrobial susceptibility dataset of 11,496 instances from 499 patients admitted to the internal medicine wards of a public hospital in Greece was processed by using Microsoft Azure AutoML to evaluate antibiotic susceptibility predictions using patients’ simple demographic characteristics, as well as previous antibiotic susceptibility testing, without any concomitant clinical data. Furthermore, the balanced dataset was also processed using the same procedure. The datasets contained the attributes of sex, age, sample type, Gram stain, 44 antimicrobial substances, and the antibiotic susceptibility results. Results: The stack ensemble technique achieved the best results in the original and balanced dataset with an area under the curve-weighted metric of 0.822 and 0.850, respectively. Conclusions: Implementation of AutoML for antimicrobial susceptibility data can provide clinicians useful information regarding possible antibiotic resistance and aid them in selecting appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy by taking into consideration the local antimicrobial resistance ecosystem."

Spatio-semantic Task Recognition: Unsupervised Learning of Task-discriminative Features for Segmentation and Imitation,2021,"['Capsule network', 'robot imitation', 'task segmentation.']",,"Discovering task subsequences from a continuous video stream facilitates a robot imitation of sequential tasks. In this research, we develop unsupervised learning of the task subsequences which does not require a human teacher to give the supervised label of the subsequence. Task-discriminative feature, in the form of sparsely activated cells called task capsules, is proposed for self-training to preserve spatio-semantic information of a visualinput. The task capsules are sparsely and exclusively activated with respect to the spatio-semantic context of the task subsequence: a type and location of the object. Therefore, the generalized purpose in multiple videos is unsupervisedly discovered according to the spatio-semantic context, and the demonstration is segmented into the task subsequences in an object-centric way. In comparison with the existing studies on unsupervised task segmentation, our work has the following distinct contribution: 1) the task provided as a video stream can be segmented without any pre-defined knowledge, 2) the trained features preserve spatio-semantic information so that the segmentation is object-centric. Our experiment shows that the recognition of the task subsequence can be applied to robot imitation for a sequential pick-and-place task by providing the semantic and location information of the object to be manipulated."

Natural language processing technology is a core technology of AI technology, and it can significantly contribute to reducing the information burden of underrstanidng reports, information objects and intelligences written in natural language by commanders and staff. In this paper, we propose a Language model-based Multi-source Information Integration (LAMII) framework to reduce the information overload of commanders and support rapid decision-making. The proposed LAMII framework consists of the key steps of representation learning based on language models in self-supervsied way and document integration using autoencoders. In the first step, representation learning that can identify the similar relationship between two heterogeneous sentences is performed using the self-supervised learning technique. In the second step, using the learned model, documents that implies similar contents or topics from multiple sources are found and integrated. At this time, the autoencoder is used to measure the information redundancy of the sentences in order to remove the duplicate sentences. In order to prove the superiority of this paper, we conducted comparison experiments using the language models and the benchmark sets used to evaluate their performance. As a result of the experiment, it was demonstrated that the proposed LAMII framework can effectively predict the similar relationship between heterogeneous sentence compared to other language models."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate denoising performance of N2V for PET image with a short acquisition time. The phantom was scanned as a list mode for 10 min using Biograph mCT40 of PET/CT (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). We compared PET images using NEMA image-quality phantom for standard acquisition time (10 min), short acquisition time (2min) and simulated PET image (S2 min). To evaluate performance of N2V, the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM) and radio-activity recovery coefficient (RC) were used. The PSNR, NRMSE and SSIM for 2 min and S2 min PET images compared to 10min PET image were 30.983, 33.936, 9.954, 7.609 and 0.916, 0.934 respectively. The RC for spheres with S2 min PET image also met European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research Ltd. (EARL) FDG PET accreditation program. We confirmed generated S2 min PET image from N2V deep learning showed improvement results compared to 2 min PET image and The PET images on visual analysis were also comparable between 10 min and S2 min PET images. In conclusion, noisy PET image by means of short acquisition time using N2V denoising network model can be improved image quality without underestimation of radioactivity."

The data gathered are interpreted by experts based on experience as the underground facilities often reflect GPR. In addition, GPR data are different in the noise and characteristics of the data depending on the equipment, environment, etc. This often results in insufficient data with accurate labels. Generally, a large amount of training data have to be obtained to apply CNN models that exhibit high performance in image classification problems. However, due to the characteristics of GPR data, it makes difficult to obtain sufficient data. Finally, this makes neural networks unable to learn based on general supervised learning methods.This paper proposes an image classification method considering data characteristics to ensure that the accuracy of each label is similar. The proposed method is based on semi-supervised learning, and the image is classified using clustering techniques after extracting the feature values of the image from the neural network. This method can be utilized not only when the amount of the labeled data is insufficient, but also when labels that depend on the data are not highly reliable."

Therefore, when multiple applications compete intensely for the LLC, its hit ratio is adversely impacted by extremely frequent cache line replacement; this may result in a significant degradation of the overall performance.

However, it is necessary to use an adaptive and intelligent cache partitioning algorithm to dynamically determine the optimal cache partition. Reinforcement learning is an appropriate approach for this kind of problems. However, its model complexity skyrockets as the number of the applications to partition increases.

Keyword analysis performed text mining using Python. According to the analysis, the biggest causes of road drop accidents were poor loading and overloading.

As a result, various problems emerged in college students’ learning experience. To establish a strategy for improving online education quality, the necessity to understand university students’ learning behavior, learner characteristics, learning satisfaction, and the impact of professor-student interaction on online lecture concentricity. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional survey conducted on college students from nine universities who experienced online lectures in the first semester of 2020. Online lecture learning behavior, learner characteristics, learning satisfaction, and professor-student interaction were analyzed using t-test, ANOVA, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient to explore the difference in online lecture concentration. Results: The concentration in-class lectures and online lectures averaged 7.04 and 5.73, respectively. According to the analysis, online learning concentration was a significant positive correlation by learner characteristics (r=.40, p<.001), professor-student interaction (r=.30, p<.001), online lecture evaluation (r=.34, p<.001). Conclusion: Therefore, it is suggested that universities should establish guidance strategies related to lecture time zones, measures for managing and supervising learners, reflecting online lecture evaluation results, and strategies for improving student interaction."
적대적 학습을 이용한 도로 노면 파손 탐지 알고리즘,2021,,,"Road surface damage detection is essential for a comfortable driving environment and the prevention of safety accidents. Road management institutes are using automated technology-based inspection equipment and systems. As one of these automation technologies, a sensor to detect road surface damage plays an important role. For this purpose, several studies on sensors using deep learning have been conducted in recent years. Road images and label images are needed to develop such deep learning algorithms. On the other hand, considerable time and labor will be needed to secure label images. In this paper, the adversarial learning method, one of the semi-supervised learning techniques, was proposed to solve this problem. For its implementation, a lightweight deep neural network model was trained using 5,327 road images and 1,327 label images. After experimenting with 400 road images, a model with a mean intersection over a union of 80.54% and an F1 score of 77.85% was developed. Through this, a technology that can improve recognition performance by adding only road images was developed to learning without label images and is expected to be used as a technology for road surface management in the future."

The purpose of this study is to describe the recent adoption of RegTech and to provide basic examples of applying RegTech to capital market regulations.Design/methodology/approachEnglish-based ontology and deep learning technologies are quite developed in practice, and it will not be difficult to expand it to European or Latin American languages that are grammatically similar to English. However, it is not easy to use it in most Asian languages such as Korean, which have different grammatical rules. In addition, in the early stages of adoption, companies, financial institutions and regulators will not be familiar with this machine-based reporting system. There is a need to establish an ecosystem which facilitates the adoption of RegTech by consulting and supporting the stakeholders. In this paper, we provide a simple example that shows a procedure of applying RegTech to recognize and interpret Korean language-based capital market regulations. Specifically, we present the process of converting sentences in regulations into a meta-language through the morpheme analyses. We next conduct deep learning analyses to determine whether a regulatory sentence exists in each regulatory paragraph.FindingsThis study illustrates the applicability of RegTech-based ontology and deep learning technologies in Korean-based capital market regulations."

The principal methodology of the study is literature analysis; to explore the possibility of applying the deep learning algorithm to landscape evaluation, we intensively reviewed researches regarding ‘urban forest landscape research’, ‘landscape evaluation scale’, and ‘feasibility of deep learning in landscape studies’. The results derived from this study are composed mainly of two contents. First, it is ‘Necessity to select images considering landscape composition and standardize evaluation indicators and scales’. The data to be evaluated for measuring the recovery effect of urban forests were found to be insufficient to be applied as a model. However, since the landscape elements and composition to be evaluated in existing studies were simply set, it will contribute to reducing the complexity of the model. When developing the model in the future, influence variables that have been proven several times in previous studies can be used as main input data. The evaluation results of existing studies that will be applied as input data to future evaluation models are composed of various scales and need to be adjusted to a level that can be compared to each other through standardization, moreover high resolution for the development and use of landscape evaluation algorithms in various fields. Second, ‘Proving of the possibility and feasibility of evaluating existing algorithms’. It is judged that the validity of the landscape evaluation model based on deep learning is high, and rather than a method of newly developing the evaluation algorithm itself, the basic data is constructed to improve the model's reliability by utilizing and partially correcting the already established landscape evaluating algorithm. This study is meaningful because it suggests directions and limitations for the future urban forest landscape evaluation model development."

The SED system estimates the classes and onset/offset times of events in the acoustic signal. In order to train the model, all information on the event class and onset/offset times must be provided. Unfortunately, the onset/offset times are hard to be labeled exactly. Therefore, in the weakly-supervised task, the SED model is trained by ""strongly labeled data"" including the event class and activations, ""weakly labeled data"" including the event class, and ""unlabeled data"" without any label. Recently, the SED systems using the mean-teacher model are widely used for the task with several parameters. These parameters should be chosen carefully because they may affect the performance. In this paper, performance analysis was performed on parameters, such as the feature, moving average parameter, weight of the consistency cost function, ramp-up length, and maximum learning rate, using the data of DCASE 2020 Task 4. Effects and the optimal values of the parameters were discussed."

However, the existing empirical equations for breaker indices mainly were proposed via statistical analysis of experimental data under the assumption of a specific equation. In this study, a new Munk-type empirical equation was proposed to predict the height of breaking waves based on a representative linear supervised machine learning technique with high predictive performance in various research fields related to regression or classification challenges.

To improve this, using CAM and Selective Search[6] together, we first expand the attention area in the heat map, and a Gaussian smoothing is applied to the extended area to generate retraining data. Finally we train the data to expand the attention area of the objects. The proposed method requires retraining only once, and the search time to find an localization area is greatly reduced since the selective search is not needed in this stage. Through the experiment, the attention area was expanded from the existing CAM heat maps, and in the calculation of IOU (Intersection of Union) with the ground truth for the bounding box of the expanded attention area, about 58% was improved compared to the existing CAM."

The subject of this study was the eyebrows, which greatly needed to be in harmony with other parts of the face. To achieve the objective, this study reviewed previous studies related to machine learning, face detection, and eyebrow design. Based on the literature review, this study identified that machine learning should focus on the measurement point of the face from the fact that (1) the semi-permanent eyebrow make-up treatment using machine learning was supervised learning and (2) measurement point error was the main issue in face detection-related studies. As a prerequisite for recommending eyebrow, it is necessary to elaborately learn measurement points for the overall face, those for the eye, close to the eyebrow, and those for lips, closely related to the length of the eyebrow. Therefore, this study presented measurement points for the overall face, eyes, and lips. Specifically, overall face, eyes, and lips required twelve, seven, and six measurement points, respectively. Moreover, as a result of the recommendation, five measurement points were needed for eyebrows and six shape data were required. To apply machine learning, a customer needs a step to experience that an eyebrow design recommended by machine learning is projected on the face of the customer in an augmented reality system similar to the existing make-up app and choose a desired shape. The machine learning-based recommendation system has many advantages over existing make-up programs and expert consultations. Above all, it provides a higher level of eyebrow designs through collaboration with experts, fundamentally expands the market for semi-permanent eyebrow make-up based on this, and furthermore, can be applied to various parts related to the contour of a face, such as lip line and hairline, which are advantages of it."

Compared to individual investor groups, professional investor groups such as foreign investors have an advantage in information and financial power and, as a result, foreign investors are known to show good investment performance among market participants.  The purpose of this study is to propose an investment strategy that combines investor-specific transaction information and machine learning, and to analyze the portfolio investment performance of the proposed model using actual stock price and investor-specific transaction data. The Korea Exchange offers daily information on the volume of purchase and sale of each investor to securities firms. We developed a data collection program in C# programming language using an API provided by Daishin Securities Cybosplus, and collected 151 out of 200 KOSPI stocks with daily opening price, closing price and investor-specific net purchase data from January 2, 2007 to July 31, 2017.  The self-organizing map model is an artificial neural network that performs clustering by unsupervised learning and has been introduced by Teuvo Kohonen since 1984. We implement competition among intra-surface artificial neurons, and all connections are non-recursive artificial neural networks that go from bottom to top. It can also be expanded to multiple layers, although many fault layers are commonly used. Linear functions are used by active functions of artificial nerve cells, and learning rules use Instar rules as well as general competitive learning. The core of the backpropagation model is the model that performs classification by supervised learning as an artificial neural network.  We grouped and transformed investor-specific transaction volume data to learn backpropagation models through the self-organizing map model of artificial neural networks. As a result of the estimation of verification data through training, the portfolios were rebalanced monthly. For performance analysis, a passive portfolio was designated and the KOSPI 200 and KOSPI index returns for proxies on market returns were also obtained.  Performance analysis was conducted using the equally-weighted portfolio return, compound interest rate, annual return, Maximum Draw Down, standard deviation, and Sharpe Ratio. Buy and hold returns of the top 10 market capitalization stocks are designated as a benchmark. Buy and hold strategy is the best strategy under the efficient market hypothesis. The prediction rate of learning data using backpropagation model was significantly high at 96.61%, while the prediction rate of verification data was also relatively high in the results of the 57.1% verification data. The performance evaluation of self-organizing map grouping can be determined as a result of a backpropagation model. This is because if the grouping results of the self-organizing map model had been poor, the learning results of the backpropagation model would have been poor. In this way, the performance assessment of machine learning is judged to be better learned than previous studies.  Our portfolio doubled the return on the benchmark and performed better than the market returns on the KOSPI and KOSPI 200 indexes. In contrast to the benchmark, the MDD and standard deviation for portfolio risk indicators also showed better results. The Sharpe Ratio performed higher than benchmarks and stock market indexes. Through this, we presented the direction of portfolio composition program using machine learning and investor-specific transaction information and showed that it can be used to develop programs for real stock investment.  The return is the result of monthly portfolio composition and asset rebalancing to the same proportion. Better outcomes are predicted when forming a monthly portfolio if the system is enforced by rebalancing the suggested stocks continuously without selling and re-buying it."

Recently, AI-based methods have received a lot of attention and so-called supervised learning methods that require classification information for data are mainly used. This supervised learning method requires a lot of time and costs because classification information (label) must be manually designated for all data required for learning. In this study, an autoencoder based on unsupervised learning was applied as an outlier detection to overcome this problem. For the experiment, two experiments were designed: one is univariate learning, in which only SST data was used among the observation data of Deokjeok Island and the other is multivariate learning, in which SST, air temperature, wind direction, wind speed, air pressure, and humidity were used. Period of data is 25 years from 1996 to 2020, and a pre-processing considering the characteristics of ocean data was applied to the data. An outlier detection of actual SST data was tried with a learned univariate and multivariate autoencoder. We tried to detect outliers in real SST data using trained univariate and multivariate autoencoders. To compare model performance, various outlier detection methods were applied to synthetic data with artificially inserted errors. As a result of quantitatively evaluating the performance of these methods, the multivariate/univariate accuracy was about 96%/91%, respectively, indicating that the multivariate autoencoder had better outlier detection performance. Outlier detection using an unsupervised learning-based autoencoder is expected to be used in various ways in that it can reduce subjective classification errors and cost and time required for data labeling."

The proposed framework is composed of two components: training data generation and offline learning. Given an example motion, the former component stochastically controls the character motion with an optimal controller while repeatedly updating the controller for tracking the example motion through model predictive control over a time window from the current state of the character to a near future state. The repeated update of the optimal controller and the stochastic control make it possible to effectively explore various states that the character may have while mimicking the example motion and collect useful training data for supervised learning. Once all the training data is generated, the latter component normalizes the data to remove the disparity for magnitude and units inherent in the data and trains an artificial neural network with a simple architecture for a controller. The experimental results for walking and running motions demonstrate how effectively and fast the proposed framework produces physics-based motion controllers."

The center of the normal metric vector is obtained through l2 norm of the extracted metric vector. The defect is detected based on the center of the obtained normal metric vector. Experimental results prove that the proposed method has higher detection accuracy than the existing method in an environment with few training data."

They relate the accident triggers to the sequence of events and the outcomes of an accident.

Previous studies on text analytics for structuring accident reports have been limited to extracting individual keywords without context. We proposed a context-based analysis using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to remedy this shortcoming. This study aims to apply Word2Vec of the NLP algorithm to extract adjacent keywords, known as word embedding, conducted by the neural network algorithm based on supervised learning. During processing, Word2Vec is conducted by adjacent keywords in narrative texts as inputs to achieve its supervised learning; keyword weights emerge as the vectors representing the degree of neighboring among keywords. Similar keyword weights mean that the keywords are closely arranged within sentences in the narrative text. Consequently, a set of keywords that have similar weights presents similar accidents. We extracted ten accident processes containing related keywords and used them to understand the risk factors determining how an accident proceeds. This information helps identify how a checklist for an accident report should be structured."

However, it is still a challenging problem to make full use of the multi-scale information of the extracted features and which appropriate feature fusion method is adopted to process feature mapping. In this paper, we propose a new adjacency auxiliary network (AANet) based on multi-scale feature fusion for SOD. Firstly, we design the parallel connection feature enhancement module (PFEM) for each layer of feature extraction, which improves the feature density by connecting different dilated convolution branches in parallel, and add channel attention flow to fully extract the context information of features. Then the adjacent layer features with close degree of abstraction but different characteristic properties are fused through the adjacent auxiliary module (AAM) to eliminate the ambiguity and noise of the features. Besides, in order to refine the features effectively to get more accurate object boundaries, we design adjacency decoder (AAM_D) based on adjacency auxiliary module (AAM), which concatenates the features of adjacent layers, extracts their spatial attention, and then combines them with the output of AAM. The outputs of AAM_D features with semantic information and spatial detail obtained from each feature are used as salient prediction maps for multi-level feature joint supervising. Experiment results on six benchmark SOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms similar previous methods."

Our algorithm estimates scene depth from a sparse feature-based visual odometry algorithm and detects/tracks objects’ bounding box by utilizing the existing object detection algorithm in parallel. Both algorithms share their results, i.e., feature, motion, and bounding boxes, to handle static and dynamic objects in the scene. We validate the scene depth accuracy of sparse features with KITTI and its ground-truth depth map made from LiDAR observations quantitatively, and the depth of detected object with the Hyundai driving datasets and satellite maps qualitatively. We compare the depth map of our algorithm with the result of (un-) supervised monocular depth estimation algorithms. The validation shows that our performance is comparable to that of monocular depth estimation algorithms which train depth indirectly (or directly) from stereo image pairs(or depth image), and better than that of algorithms trained with monocular images only, in terms of the error and the accuracy. Also, we confirm that our computational load is much lighter than the learning-based methods, while showing comparable performance."

It also examined the effects of education methods established as a result of the investigation by implementing in actual classes and observing the learners’ responses.When managing writing courses for learners, significant gaps in their learning and writing capacity should be managed to provide a customized learning experience for each learner. Close attention for each learner is especially important in a non-contact learning environment. Such attention can be provided through communicative interaction between instructors and learners.Thus, this study designed a basic curriculum based on fundamental learner-centered education that helps learners to participate in courses through enhanced learning motivation. The most important element in the design was the role of the instructor as a companion and an ally who would share concerns and provide support to learners so that they can work on their individual project successfully. An additional important element considered was the establishment of an environment in which learners can proceed with their daily tasks using a variety of online learning tools within the boundary of real-time video lectures. The instructors should remotely supervise the learners and provide immediate feedback and support to learners.As a result of proceeding with lectures using the suggested method, most learners were generally satisfied with the lecture and responded that the sessions were as effective as face-to-face lectures. They also acknowledged that this learning method allowed them to concentrate and that it will be helpful in learning how to write in future. The most important response from the learners was that the immediate feedback provided in the non-contact environment was a benefit that face-toface lectures do not offer. This particular benefit can be applied to learning methods even after the lectures return to the face-to-face environment in future."

Class Specific Autoencoders Enhance Sample Diversity,2021,"['Pseudo examples', 'semi-supervised learning', 'few shot learning', 'adversarial attacks']",,"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) and few-shot learning (FSL) have shown impressive performance even then the volume of labeled data is very limited. However, SSL and FSL can encounter a significant performance degradation if the diversity gap between the labeled and unlabeled data is high. To reduce this diversity gap, we propose a novel scheme that relies on an autoencoder for generating pseudo examples. Specifically, the autoencoder is trained on a specific class using the available labeled data and the decoder of the trained autoencoder is then used to generate N samples of that specific class based on N random noise, sampled from a standard normal distribution. The above process is repeated for all the classes. Consequently, the generated data reduces the diversity gap and enhances the model performance. Extensive experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets for SSL and FSL verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of classification accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks."

Therefore, this study aimed to discriminate adrenal tumors from a single blood sample based on the combination of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and machine learning algorithms in serum profiling of adrenal steroids.Methods: The LC-MS-based steroid profiling was applied to serum samples obtained from patients with nonfunctioning adenoma(NFA, n=73), Cushing’s syndrome (CS, n=30), and primary aldosteronism (PA, n=40) in a prospective multicenter study of adrenaldisease. The decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) were performed to categorize the subtypes of adrenal tumors.Results: The CS group showed higher serum levels of 11-deoxycortisol than the NFA group, and increased levels of tetrahydrocortisone (THE), 20α-dihydrocortisol, and 6β-hydroxycortisol were found in the PA group. However, the CS group showed lower levelsof dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate derivative (DHEA-S) than both the NFA and PA groups. Patients with PA expressed higher serum 18-hydroxycortisol and DHEA but lower THE than NFA patients. The balanced accuracies of DT, RF, andXGBoost for classifying each type were 78%, 96%, and 97%, respectively. In receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis forCS, XGBoost, and RF showed a significantly greater diagnostic power than the DT. However, in ROC analysis for PA, only RF exhibited better diagnostic performance than DT.Conclusion: The combination of LC-MS-based steroid profiling with machine learning algorithms could be a promising one-stepdiagnostic approach for the classification of adrenal tumor subtypes."

Since a 2D image inherently might originate from an infinite number of different 3D scenes, thus 3D reconstruction from a single image is notoriously challenging. This challenge has been overcame by the advent of recent deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), by modeling the mapping function between 2D image and 3D information. However, to train such deep CNNs, a massive training data is demanded, but such data is difficult to achieve or even impossible to build. Recent trends thus aim to present deep learning techniques that can be trained in a weakly-supervised manner, with a meta-data without relying on the ground-truth depth data. In this article, we introduce recent developments of weakly-supervised deep learning technique, especially categorized as scene 3D reconstruction and object 3D reconstruction, and discuss limitations and further directions."

Second, as an artificial neural network extension education case, an artificial neural network education case for recognizing three types of images was proposed. Finally, the results of analyzing artificial neural network training cases and training satisfaction analysis results are presented. Through the proposed training case, it is possible to learn about the operation principle of artificial neural networks, the method of writing training data, the number of parameter calculations executed according to the amount of training data, and parameter optimization. The results of the education satisfaction survey for preservice teachers and incumbent teachers showed a positive response result of over 70% for each survey item, indicating high class application suitability."

The reason for using these data is that the descriptive lecture evaluation contains various students opinions, so useful information can be derived for future class improvement plans. The existing method for deriving useful information using lecture evaluation text data was only to perform simple aggregation by classifying the contents into several related categories. Unlike existing methods, this study intends to derive useful information by using text mining among data mining techniques. To this end, first, the machine learning method was applied to predictively classify whether the lecture evaluation text material was positive or negative. Second, for specific analysis, k-means cluster analysis, topic analysis, sentiment analysis, and naive Bayes method were applied. The unsupervised learning technique used the entire dataset, and the naive Bayes method, a supervised learning technique, used a validation data set (70%) to find the optimal model, and tested the optimal model with the validation data set (30%) and analyzed. As a result of the analysis, the naive Bayes method showed a correct classification rate of 84%, showing superior performance compared to the topic analysis (68%) and sentiment analysis (75%) methods, and was confirmed as the most appropriate model among the methods considered."

Current cyber security control is highly dependent on the level of human ability. In other words, it is practically unreasonable to analyze various logs generated by people from different types of equipment and analyze and process all of the security events that are rapidly increasing. And, the signature-based security equipment that detects by matching a string and a pattern has insufficient functions to accurately detect advanced and advanced cyberattacks such as APT (Advanced Persistent Threat). As one way to solve these pending problems, the artificial intelligence technology of supervised and unsupervised learning is applied to the detection and analysis of cyber attacks, and through this, the analysis of logs and events that occur innumerable times is automated and intelligent through this. The level of response has been raised in the overall aspect by making it possible to predict and block the continuous occurrence of cyberattacks. And after applying AI security control technology, an improved integrated security control service model was newly proposed by integrating and solving the problem of overlapping detection of AI and SIEM into a unified breach response process(procedure)."

There are a total of 8 instructors, all of whom are women; have been in the Gyeonggi region for an average of 6 years, and have guided children with underachieving children through this program, . Major findings are as follows. Firstly, through the basic learning intervention project, children showed changes in their attitudes towards learning as well as greater basic academic achievement. Also, there were also children who reached the grade level. Secondly, changes were detected not only academically but also psychosocially such as in their confidence levels and social skills. Thirdly, the competence and attitude of the instructors contributed to the changes in the children. Finally, 1:1 individual supervised learning and group motivation programs seem to be attributed to changes in the children. Based on the results above, suggestions for different methods to enhance the intervention strategies for underachieving children were discussed for future research. Because there has been no extensive research into basic learning intervention programs for underachieving students, the implications of the results obtained through this study meaningfully contribute to the field of social welfare."

Enhancing Clustering Algorithm with Initial Centroids in Tool Wear Region Recognition,2021,['Semi-supervised learning · Clustering · Tool wear region · Statistical analysis · Z-rot'],,"Autonomous manufacturing allows the system to distinguish between a mild, normal and total failure in tool condition. K-means clustering has become the most applied algorithm in discovering classes in an unsupervised scenario. Nevertheless, the algorithm is sensitive to the initial centroids giving various solution every time the system updating. Regular unsupervised K-means is refocused as semi-supervised Fixum K-means. It is embedded with a new tactic to recapture the K value and new initial seedings computation to kick off the system until it converges. Force components of cutting force F c , thrust force F t and perpendicular cutting force F cn were extracted from Neo-MoMac cutting force measurement device. The analysis threshold represents a natural-sorted input vector as Z -rot coefficient ( R Z ) corresponds to the number of cutting accomplish a strong correlation ( R 2 = 0.8511) over wear evolution. The clustering system adopted a new calculation of initial centroids has successfully determined the three regions for only a single assignment and achieving the optimal distance squared through eight given data sets. It is conflicting with the standard K-means that return different clustering structure in each run, while K-means + + replicates several times to achieve minimum objective function. During the course, F-Km delivered robust and consistence clustering results of 85% accuracy over standard K-means and four times converges faster than K-means + + . The silhouette value average score is 0.8504 (highest score is 0.9207) of how well-distributed the resulting clusters. The clustering system has identified the tool to stop cutting at approximate VB = 0.213 mm before the tool condition enters the failure region of abnormal phase ( VB < 0.250 mm ).s The proposed system functioned effectively in clustering the data obtained from cutting tests performed within a reasonable range of wear stages. Precision and robustness analysis have proved F-km to score 100% attainment for clustering assignment output and replicability. In contrast, K-means scored 76.3% for precision and ranging from 5 to 33% for robustness. Whereas, K-means + + scored 33% for robustness and a higher chance of time complexity compared to F-km. F-Km is found to be more accurate, time savvy and robust than standard K-means and K-means + + .

Since the southern coastal region of the Korean peninsula was originally dominated by warm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved forests, it is desirable to restore forests in this region to their original vegetation. In this study, we identified suitable areas to be restored as evergreen broad-leaved forests by analyzing the environmental factors of existing evergreen broad-leaved forests in the islands of Jeollanam-do. We classified forest lands in the study area into six vegetation types from Sentinel-2 satellite images using a deep learning algorithm and analyzed the tolerance ranges of existing evergreen broad-leaved forests by measuring the locational, topographic, and climatic attributes of the classified vegetation types. Results showed that evergreen broad-leaved forests were distributed more in areas with a high altitudes and steep slope, where human intervention was relatively low. The human intervention has led to a higher distribution of evergreen broad-leaved forests in areas with lower annual average temperature, which was an unexpected but understandable result because an area with higher altitude has a lower temperature. Of the environmental factors, latitude and average temperature in the coldest month (January) were relatively less contaminated by the effects of human intervention, thus enabling the identification of suitable restoration areas of the evergreen broad-leaved forests. The tolerance range analysis of evergreen broad-leaved forests showed that they mainly grew in areas south of the latitude of 34.7° and a monthly average temperature of 1.7°C or higher in the coldest month. Therefore, we predicted the areas meeting these criteria to be suitable for restoring evergreen broad-leaved forests. The suitable areas cover 614.5 ㎢, which occupies 59.0% of the total forest lands on the islands of Jeollanamdo, and 73% of actual forests that exclude agricultural and other non-restorable forest lands. The findings of this study can help forest managers prepare a restoration plan and budget for island forests."

Hitherto, customer credit risk is narrowed to the direct loss resulting from the borrower’s failure to contractual obligation of loan products. The indirect loss, such as legal and compliance liability, reputation damage, is usually neglected. The indirect loss is generally caused by providing services to customers who launch illegal transactions, such as money laundering and terrorist financing activities. As required by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, banks should strengthen the customer risk supervision and avoid providing services to abnormal customers. Usually, a customer needs to apply for an account before launching financial activities. Thus, a risk assessment at the account opening services can not only help the bank filter some fraudulent and criminal customers but also provide guidance on allocating the limited supervision resource. Conventionally, such a risk assessment procedure is labor-intensive. Given the massive business volume caused by digitalization, the problems of human resource shortage and high human errors caused by overburdened workload are even more serious. Yet, previous works only explored abnormal account activities supervision after account generation, whereas the automatic risk assessment method on account opening services is rarely covered. To address these problems, in this study, a novel preliminary risk level is firstly developed to indicate the different likelihood of risk levels in account opening service. In addition, an automatic risk level classifier is developed with a designed two-staged neural network utilizing geographic, demographic, and behavioral features. The experiment results verify the high classification accuracy at 96.7%. Moreover, given the similar compositions of international customers between Korea and Hong Kong, this work could also provide guidance to Korean banks on customer preliminary risk assessment."

Here, five issues were reviewed regarding the enforcement of the Act.First, the obligation for an employer to hire dual trainees as permanent employees when they pass external evaluation seems to accord with the basic philosophy of Fixed-term Act which allows maximum 2 years of fixed-term contract in principal. Second, ‘the training hours outside the workplace’ which companies are not obligated to pay wages, need to include class hours in regular schools or joint training centers outside the supervision of the employers. Third, without giving National Technical Certificates to holders of Dual Certificates, it is necessary to inform the public that Dual Certificates are equivalent to National Technical Certificates in the same trades. Fourth, as Dual certificates and Course-evaluation National Technical certificates are similar ones based on the National Competency Standards, they need to be gradually unified. Fifth, it is necessary to differentiate study vs. work between 「field-learning program」 and dual program in technical high-school.For the development of optimal Korean dual model, future studies are invited, based on more theoretical frameworks (such as institutional theory, varieties of capitalism, etc.) to analyze various factors affecting the success of dual systems under different environments among countries."

Internet-only banks have created more social and economic utility due to their features of online operations, low cost, and long-tail customer positioning, all of which made them significantly different from traditional commercial banks in many aspects. Based on analysis of internet-only banks’ current developments in China and South Korea, it is inferred that, as the internet-only banks follow the trend of online business thus meeting customers’ needs, they have grown too fast, thus special legislations different from commercial banks has become increasingly urgent. In China, however, although internet-only banks’ businesses have developed to a considerable scale, the legislation in this field is still seriously lagging behind. The lack of specialized legislation has led to lots of serious problems, such as too much discretion for administrative agencies, insufficient supervision on major shareholders, deficiency in consumer protection, and inappropriate information disclosure. South Korea has taken the lead in internet-only banks legislation, especially the rules and regulations on “separation of banking and industry”. To learn from Korea, this paper has carefully analyzed the reference significance of Korean internet-only banks legislation to China from the perspective of comparative law, including formulating special legislations, enhancing big shareholders’ supervision, implementing the principle of separation of banking and industry, strengthening financial consumer protection and information disclosure, and improving supporting laws, etc., so as to provide feasible suggestions to improve China's future internet-only banks legislation."

There are two major legal apparatuses currently in place to regulate English proficiency tests used in Korea: (a) the Framework Act on Qualifications and its associated decree; and (b) the Decree on Public Officials Appointment Examinations.One critical problem of the existing legal system, however, is that it is being imposed only on domestic tests, exempting international tests. Although both domestic and international tests are competing for market share in Korea when used for recruitment, employment, and placement purposes, there is no properly-functioning procedure to check the observance or violations of quality control standards for the international tests and to review the fairness of score conversion among these tests at the state level.The main goals of the current investigation are to: (a) critically review relevant laws on certification testing; (b) discuss the limitations of the existing systems of national accreditation/regulation by reviewing test revision history, mean score trends, and recent score conversion results of New TEPS and TOEIC; and finally (c) suggest possible ways to reform these national accreditation/supervision systems."

However, despite its importance, a robust solution has not yet been provided. This paper proposes a network and dataset construction methodology to remove only the glasses from facial images effectively. To obtain an image with the glasses removed from an image with glasses by the supervised learning method, a network that converts them and a set of paired data for training is required. To this end, we created a large number of synthetic images of glasses being worn using facial attribute transformation networks. We adopted the conditional GAN (cGAN) frameworks for training. The trained network converts the in-the-wild face image with glasses into an image without glasses and operates stably even in situations wherein the faces are of diverse races and ages and having different styles of glasses."

We found the cosine similarity between chapters within the novel is relatively high, but not between the novels. Furthermore, clustering analysis, which is an unsupervised machine learning task, showed strong cohesion of semantic distance, and classification analysis, which is a supervised machine learning task, showed high accuracy. In addition, we have confirmed that children's novels can be classified as easy-to-read works due to the large cosine similarity value and small semantic distance between chapters. Therefore, quantitative text analysis using text mining technique is expected to serve as a foundation for performing qualitative text analysis."

Why is science originating from the Greek era recognized for its importance in the era of advanced artificial intelligence? The case where the service was interrupted due to the racist speech and behavior learned by AI chatbot Tay while talking with users, or the psychopathic tendency revealed by Norman, an artificial intelligence developed by the MIT research team. These are examples that show the importance of ethical consideration in the development of AI. So why does AI cause ethical problems? This is because AI learns based on biased data. The deficiencies of AI begin from the bias of data including gender, race, and region.  The Korean dialect AI data construction project is a state-led data construction project under the supervision of the National Information Society Agency. The voice data built in this project is very valuable in that it collects free speech, which has been pointed out that the absolute amount of the existing voice data is insufficient, and it is collected in consideration of the distribution of speakers by age by region. It offers the possibility of overcoming bias caused by exclusions in the data."
인공지능 시대의 도래와 디지털화에 따른 행정자동결정의 법적 쟁점 ― 특히 행정기본법상 자동적 처분의 문제점을 중심으로 ―,2021,"['행정기본법', '자동적 처분', '완전자동화 행정행위', '완전자동화 시스템', '인공지능', '디지털화', '민주적 정당성', '행정자동결정', '재량행위', '알고리즘', '전자적 행정행위', '리스크관리', '위험책임', '팬데믹', 'General Act on Public Administration', 'Automatic Dispositions', 'fully-automated administrative act', 'fully-automated system', 'artificial intelligence', 'Digitization', 'democratic legitimacy', 'automatic administrative decision', 'discretionary action', 'algorithm', 'electronic administrative actions', 'risk management', 'risk responsibility', 'pandemic']","인공지능(AI)의 시대가 도래하고 있으며, 행정은 디지털화의 전환국면에 있다. 디지털화와 행정의 현대화에 따라 2021년 3월 23일에 제정된 행정기본법 제20조에도 ‘자동적 처분’에 관한 조항이 도입되었다. 그러나 자동적 처분이 완전자동화 행정행위에 제한되는지, 이러한 자동적 처분에 권력적 사실행위도 포함되는지가 명확하지 않다. 행정기본법 제20조의 표제에서 ‘완전히 자동화된 행정행위’라고 규정하는 것이 바람직하다. 또한 괄호 속의 “인공지능 기술을 적용한 시스템을 포함한다”는 규정은 삭제되어야 한다. 이는 자동적 처분을 재량이 없는 영역에 제한하고 있는 행정기본법 제20조 단서의 규정에 비추어 타당하지 않다. 독일에서도 스스로 학습하는 알고리즘은 독일 행정절차법 제35a조의 적용대상이 아니라는 견해가 지배적이다. 인공지능시대의 행정자동결정은 민주주의와 법치주의를 위협하고 있으며, 절차적 측면에서 민주적 정당성이 확보되어야 한다. 빅 데이터를 활용한 대량행정이나 행정자동결정은 개인정보나 프라이버시를 중대하게 침해할 수 있다. 코로나 팬데믹은 그러한 위험성을 보여주고 있다. 디지털 방식으로 접촉자를 추적하고, 코로나앱을 통해 접촉자나 격리자를 감시하고 있다. 자동적 처분에 절차규정을 보완할 필요가 있다. 청문, 의견제출, 이유제시 및 통지 등 행정절차법의 규정을 완전자동화 행정행위에 그대로 적용하기가 어려운 경우도 있다. 이러한 규정을 두지 않으면 자동적 처분은 절차상 하자로 인해 위법이 될 수 있다. 행정기본법과 행정절차법의 규정을 정비해서 자동적 처분에 대한 예외규정을 신설할 필요가 있다. 이러한 규정을 정비할 때 민주적 정당성을 상실하거나 절차적 정의가 왜곡되지 않도록 주의해야 한다. 자동적 처분에 대한 행정쟁송에도 일반적 원칙에 따라 행정행위의 위법이 심사되어야 한다. 실체적 위법의 판단에는 행정기본법 제20조의 해석이 중요하다. 나아가 자동적 처분에 대한 손해발생에 대해 국가책임을 물을 수 있는지도 중요한 문제이다. 빅 데이터에 의해 설정된 프로그램의 오류나 편견으로 인해 중대한 손해가 발생한 경우가 그러하다. 이와 관련하여 위험책임의 법리가 고려될 필요가 있다. 자동적 처분에 대한 합리적 규제나 감독이 보장되어야 하며, 예측할 수 없는 손해를 사전배려의 관점에서 고려하는 리스크관리시스템이 필요하다.","The era of artificial intelligence (AI) is coming, and the administration is in the transition phase of digitalization. In accordance with digitalization and modernization of administration, Article 20 of the General Act on Public Administration enacted on March 23, 2021, also introduced a provision on ‘automatic disposition’. However, it is not clear whether automatic disposition is limited to fully-automated administrative actions, and whether these automatic dispositions also include powerful factual acts. It is desirable to define ‘completely automated administrative act’ in the title of Article 20 of the General Act on Public Administration. In addition, the provision that “includes systems to which artificial intelligence technology is applied” in parentheses should be deleted. This is not reasonable in light of the proviso to Article 20 of the General Act on Public Administration, which restricts automatic disposition to areas without discretion. In Germany, the dominant view is that self-learning algorithms are not subject to Article 35a of the German Administrative Procedure Act. Automated administrative decisions in the age of artificial intelligence threaten democracy and the rule of law, and democratic legitimacy must be secured in terms of procedures. Mass administration or automatic administrative decision using big data can seriously infringe on personal information or privacy. The coronavirus pandemic shows such a risk. It is tracking contacts digitally and monitoring contacts or quarantined people through the Corona-app. It is necessary to supplement the procedure provisions for automatic disposition. In some cases, it is difficult to apply the provisions of the Korean Administrative Procedure Act, such as hearings, submission of opinions, giving reasons and notification, to fully automated administrative actions. If these regulations are not provided, automatic disposition may be illegal due to procedural defects. It is necessary to reorganize the provisions of the General Act on Public Administration of Korea and the Korean Administrative Procedure Act to establish an exception to automatic disposition. When revising these regulations, care must be taken not to lose democratic legitimacy or distort procedural justice. In administrative litigation against automatic disposition, the illegality of administrative act should be reviewed in accordance with the general principle. The interpretation of Article 20 of the General Act on Public Administration is important in determining substantive illegality. Furthermore, it is also an important issue whether the state can be held responsible for damage caused by automatic disposition. This is the case when serious damage is caused by errors or biases in programs set by big data. In this regard, the theory of risk liability needs to be considered. Reasonable regulation or supervision of automatic disposal should be guaranteed, and a risk management system that considers unpredictable damage in advance from this point of view is necessary."

Its systematic intention is to allow persons who have passed a bar examination to settle themselves as professionals in a short time by letting them intensively learn practical ability during the practical training period of six months. This system was introduced with the first bar examination in 2011 ahead after fierce disputes in the Special Committee on Judicial Reform launched by the National Assembly. However, as several operational problems were revealed, including inadequate treatment of apprentice lawyers from the first examination in 2012 in the early phase of introduction, it has been faced a lot of criticism, and adjudication on a constitutional complaint was lodged.Currently, the Department of Justice and Korean Bar Association interpret the business scope of apprentice lawyers very narrowly. Despite the lawyers engaged in legal affairs are the ones who have passed a bar examination and finished the registration of qualifications, they cannot delegate cases in their names and are not allowed to appoint lawyers in charge, provide legal service, have an interview, participate in an investigation, attend the court and plead at the bar. Due to the concentration of law school education on bar examination and the lack of practical training, even though the importance of practical training for people who have passed a bar examination gradually increases, the present system excessively limits the business scope of the lawyers engaged in legal affairs.In most developed nations, sufficient opportunities are provided for apprentice lawyers to experience real lawyers’ duties like court proceedings and case delegation, etc. in a certain scope on condition of being supervised by guidance lawyers, and this fact implies much for us. In the future, it would be necessary to return to the intention of introducing the practical training system for lawyers by expanding the business scope of apprentice lawyers to the duties that have not been allowed for them within the range that it would be able to promote the maximization of the effect of practical training and the protection of clients’ interests.This study comprehensively examined the present regulation and status of the business scope of the lawyer engaged in legal affairs and proposed measures for expanding the business scope of the lawyer engaged in legal affairs. Through the expansion of the business scope of the lawyer engaged in legal affairs according to the practical training system for lawyers, the practical training system for lawyers will contribute to the diversification of the professional domain of lawyers and the qualitative improvement of legal services as well beyond the promotion of lawyers’ practical ability."

Therefore, 2020 can be called the “first year of criminal compliance” in China. In 2021, China further expanded the pilot scope of enterprise criminal compliance reform. Which procuratorate led criminal compliance reform model can be copied and promoted? How to construct a set of criminal compliance system with Chinese characteristics? This is an academic topic worth observing and thinking, and it also has important practical significance. Different from the “legal person independent responsibility + deferred prosecution agreement (DPA)” model in Britain and the United States and the “legal representative responsibility + judicial agreement based on public interest (CJIP)” model in France. From the perspective of procedural law, Chinese academic circles have put forward the transformation mode of directly learning from the agreement mode of suspension of prosecution, the lenient system mode of pleading guilty and punishment, and the conditional non prosecution system; From the perspective of substantive law, it puts forward the phased transformation mode of unit crime system and the pre-set mode of criminal compliance obligation. However, these modes have the limitations that the thought of criminal integration is not fully implemented. On the other hand, Chinese judicial circles have explored the following criminal compliance modes: the system mode of legal interest restoration investigation period, “relative non prosecution + procuratorial advice” mode, the whole process criminal compliance supervision mode, “independent supervisor + compliance specialist” mode, and the “enterprise + entrepreneur” criminal Compliance Investigation Mode. Although these models have their own characteristics and make a breakthrough in the criminal compliance system model of western countries, they all have the problem of insufficient legitimacy and scientificity to varying degrees. In essence, the construction of criminal compliance is a profound revolution in crime governance. To creatively transform the enterprise compliance concept originated in western countries in combination with China’s national conditions, so as to explore the criminal compliance system with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to critically learn from the experience of South Korea, Britain and other countries, strengthen systematic governance, legal governance, comprehensive governance and source governance, and pay attention to science and technology to support governance innovation, Better transform the institutional advantages into the effectiveness of crime governance, including enterprise crime."

The construction of a intelligence society is a deeply integrated military-civilian approach to national governance on the basis of network information security. As a model of civil-military integration, Beidou navigation system has made great progress in the past decades. Network and information security is the key to the development of civil-military integration. Especially, the protection of location-based-service (LBS) privacy is a peculiar problem in military-civilian conversion. Taking the Beidou navigation satellite system as an example, which is a model of civil-military integration development in the era of intelligence, this paper introduces the concept and protection of LBS privacy as well as the domestic and foreign regulations on LBS privacy and personal information. Based on the similarity between LBS privacy and personal information, the legal protection of location privacy can refer to the relevant legal provisions of personal information. This paper analyzes the use of location information and the protection of location privacy by operators and third parties. As the privacy of users, location privacy information may be infringed by operators and third parties. However, at this stage, it is not possible to carry out the technical constraints of location privacy protection, therefore it can only rely on legal means for effective protection. We need to learn from the advanced experience of American and European countries, including clarification of contract supervision responsibilities, internal supervision and control of the use of data by third parties, post-event accountability and relief systems, and coordinated development mechanisms for the industrialization of dual-use technologies. This paper explores the path of legal protection of location privacy from the above six aspects, including improving legislative design, clarifying confidentiality obligations, standardizing regulatory responsibilities, clarifying legal responsibilities, implementing incentive mechanism, and realizing right rescue."

In order to achieve the end, data for the research were collected through documents pertaining to comprehensive teaching practicum programs offered by the A Educational Practice School, the records of teaching practicum programs prepared by student teachers, as well as interviews with trainees, supervising teachers, and administrating teachers. With the collected data, it was analyzed that the current status of the operation of blended teaching practicum programs, and the experience of trainees and supervisors who participated. Primary results are presented in the following: First, while the win-win strategy was planned for both university of education and practicum school before the teaching practicum, the participants were worried and anticipating at the same time. Secondly, while the contactless online training and meetings during teaching practicum were satisfactory, it was hard to build up rapport with students. The participants were satisfied with class activities and classroom management during the contact session. Third, the participants pointed out strengths of contactless practicum as quickness and accuracy and pointed out strengths of contact practicum as sense of bond and communication. In regard to the improvement points, the contactless period mainly focused on the two weeks of observation. Although it got better than the online practicum, the participants still lacked interaction with students. Comprehensively, although the blended teaching practicum got better than the online teaching practicum, it was successful by “Half” because it wasn’t as satisfactory as the 4 weeks of contact teaching practicum. This study holds implications in suggesting the cases of running various forms of blended teaching practicum such as blended learning class between the practicum schools."
특정인에 대한 범죄예측 시스템의 문제점과 개선방안,2021,"['범죄예측 시스템', '특정인', '인공지능', '알고리즘', '범죄예방', '범죄자 예측', 'Crime Prediction System', 'specific person', 'artificial intelligence', 'algorithms', 'crime prevention', 'criminal prediction']","머신러닝 및 딥러닝 기술에 근거한 인공지능이 빅데이터라는 방대한 자료 속에서 숨겨진 정보들 간의 상관관계를 찾아내고 이를 바탕으로 미래에 어떤 일이 발생할 것인지를 통계적으로 예측하고 있다. 이를 활용하여 사회의 많은 분야에서 상당히 높은 수준의 예측을 하고 있다. 이러한 높은 예측력은 범죄예방분야에서도 활용되고 있는데, 이미 선진국에서는 범죄발생률이 높은 대도시를 중심으로 빅 데이터와 인공지능을 이용한 범죄예측 시스템을 도입함으로써 범죄율이 감소하는 등 가시적인 효과를 보고 있다. 이러한 범죄예측 시스템의 방법은 범죄 예측, 범죄 피해자 예측, 범죄자 예측 등 크게 3가지로 구분할 수 있다. 특정한 범죄자와 피해자와 같은 특정인의 범죄를 전망하는 범죄자 예측과 피해자 예측은 개인의 Privacy가 침해된다는 점과 민감한 개인정보의 수집 범위가 제한적이라는 점에서 연구 및 활용이 제한되었다. 이 때문에 범죄예측 시스템은 장소별, 지역별 범죄 위험도를 기반으로 한 범죄발생의 시간과 장소를 전망하는 시공간 범죄예측이 주를 이루고 있다. 이러한 상황에서 본 연구는 특정인에 대한 범죄예측 시스템에서 발생할 수 있는 문제점을 제기하고 이에 대한 신속한 대처방안을 모색하는데 목표를 두고자 한다. 특정인에 대한 범죄예측 시스템은 특정인의 개인정보를 다루기 때문에 필연적으로 헌법상 보장된 사생활의 비밀과 자유 및 개인정보자기결정권 등의 기본권을 침해할 수밖에 없다. 특정인을 대상자로 할 경우 일반인과의 형평성의 문제가 제기될 수 있다. 또한 대상범죄를 어느 범위까지 허용할 것인지 명확한 한계를 설정하기 어렵다. 범죄예측 시스템에 사용되는 인공지능 알고리즘은 불명투명성, 편향성, 부정확성의 문제가 있다. 인공지능 알고리즘의 불투명성은 부정확한 범죄예측으로 인한 피해나 그 책임의 소재를 찾는데 어려움을 줄 수 있다. 또한 인공지능 알고리즘이 지닌 잠재적 편향성과 부정확성 때문에 범죄예측이 공정하지 못하다는 비판을 받고 있다. 그리고 범죄예측 시스템은 시민들에게 새로운 통제수단이 되고 있다. 이러한 문제점을 해결하기 위해서는 먼저, 개인정보보호법 제15조 1항 1호에 의해 정보주체의 사전 동의를 반드시 받도록 하여야 할 것이다. 범죄예측을 위한 특정인에 대한 개인정보수집은 합목적적 범위 내에서 필요최소한에 그쳐야 할 것이고, 잘못된 결과가 발생할 경우를 회피 내지 개선할 수 있는 적당한 조치를 사전에 보장하여야 한다. 모든 개인정보수집은 감독기관의 적절한 감독을 받을 것을 보장하여야 한다. 알고리즘의 불투명성을 해결하는 방법으로는 정보 주체나 일반인을 대신하여 알고리즘의 적절성을 심사하고 감시하는 조직이나 기관을 설치하는 방법을 제시할 수 있다. 편향성 및 부정확성 해결방안으로 범죄예측 시스템을 통한 범죄예방의 효과성이 입증되어 공개되어야 하며 범죄예측 시스템의 알고리즘의 정확성이 담보되어야 할 것이다. 범죄예측 시스템의 적용대상범죄와 대상자의 선정을 위해서는 재범의 중대성과 위험성이 중요한 판단 기준이 될 것이다. 범죄예측 시스템을 사용한 범죄예측은 살인, 강도, 강간, 방화와 같은 중대범죄여야 할 것이다. 범죄예측 시스템이 시민에 대한 통제장치로서 악용될 우려를 불식시키기 위해서는 범죄예측 시스템도 보안처분과 같이 비례성의 원칙에 의하여 대상자의 권리침해를 최소화하여야 한다. 범죄예측 시스템은 형벌이나 다른 보안처분에 의하여 목적을 달성할 수 없는 최후수단으로서 사용되어야 할 것이다. 대상자의 재범위험성을 근거로 개별적으로 사용하여야 한다. 범죄예측시스템은 행정처분에 의하여 행해져서는 안되고 법원의 사법심사에 의하여 부과되어야 한다.","Artificial intelligence based on machine learning and deep learning technology finds correlations between hidden information in the vast data of big data and statistically predicts what will happen in the future. Using AI, there are high-level predictions in many fields of society. This high predictive power of AI is also being used in the field of crime prevention. In developed countries, crime prediction systems using big data and artificial intelligence have been introduced intensively in large cities with high crime rates. And they are producing tangible effects such as a decrease in the crime rate. The methods of such a crime prediction system can be broadly divided into 3 categories: ① crime prediction, ② criminal prediction, ③ crime victim prediction. Because of the limited scope of collection of sensitive personal information and protection of personal privacy, crime prediction, which predicts the time and place of a crime based on the crime risk by region and location, is mainly used rather than predicting criminals and victims. In this situation, the purpose of this study is to raise the problems that may appear in the crime prediction system for a specific person and to find a quick response method. Therefore, in this study, the problem of infringement of individual constitutional and legal rights that may occur when the crime prediction system is used for a specific person, the problem of opacity, inaccuracy and bias of the algorithm of the crime prediction system, and the problem of the crime prediction system as a new control means. We will review the potential problems and seek solutions to them. Since the crime prediction system for a specific person deals with the personal information of a specific person, it inevitably violates the basic rights such as privacy and freedom and the right to self-determination of personal information guaranteed by the Constitution. When targeting a specific person, the issue of equity with the general public may be raised. In addition, it is difficult to set clear limits on the extent to which target crimes are permitted. Artificial intelligence algorithms used in crime prediction systems have problems of opacity, bias, and inaccuracy. The opacity of artificial intelligence algorithms can make it difficult to find the cause of damage or responsibility due to inaccurate crime prediction. In addition, due to the potential bias and inaccuracy of artificial intelligence algorithms, crime prediction is being criticized for being unfair. And the crime prediction system is becoming a new means of control for citizens. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to first obtain the prior consent of the information subject according to Article 15 (1) 1 of the Personal Information Protection Act. The collection of personal information for a specific person for crime prediction should be limited to the minimum necessary within the scope of the purpose of the crime, and appropriate measures to avoid or improve the occurrence of erroneous results should be ensured in advance. It should be ensured that all personal information collection is subject to appropriate supervision by the supervisory authority. As a method of solving the opacity of the algorithm, it can be suggested to establish an organization or institution that examines and monitors the adequacy of the algorithm on behalf of the data subject or the general public. As a solution to bias and inaccuracy, the effectiveness of crime prevention through the crime prediction system should be proven and disclosed, and the accuracy of the crime prediction system algorithm should be guaranteed. The seriousness and risk of recidivism will be an important criterion for the selection of target crimes and targets for the crime prediction system. Crime prediction using the crime prediction system should be serious crimes such as murder, robbery, rape,"
