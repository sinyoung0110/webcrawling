A Knowledge Extraction Pipeline between Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Using Gaussian Mixture Models for Anomaly Detection,2021,"['Classification', 'Clustering', 'Association rules', 'Knowledge extraction', 'Swarm intelligence']",,"This paper presents a new approach to design a decision support model with suitability across various contexts, and in particular for the Internet of Things. It provides an anomaly detection-learning model that is adapted to the patient""s medical condition. A highly balanced artificial intelligence based on a Gaussian mixture model and association rules leverages the knowledge acquired through cross-referencing supervised and unsupervised machine learning. This process ensures an unsupervised cluster-based model, to accurately classify medical inputs according to their risk level and provide a knowledge extraction bridge between the supervised and unsupervised aspects of the data, thereby enhancing the medical decision-making process to be data-driven and therefore case-specific."
Spatio-semantic Task Recognition: Unsupervised Learning of Task-discriminative Features for Segmentation and Imitation,2021,"['Capsule network', 'robot imitation', 'task segmentation.']",,"Discovering task subsequences from a continuous video stream facilitates a robot imitation of sequential tasks. In this research, we develop unsupervised learning of the task subsequences which does not require a human teacher to give the supervised label of the subsequence. Task-discriminative feature, in the form of sparsely activated cells called task capsules, is proposed for self-training to preserve spatio-semantic information of a visualinput. The task capsules are sparsely and exclusively activated with respect to the spatio-semantic context of the task subsequence: a type and location of the object. Therefore, the generalized purpose in multiple videos is unsupervisedly discovered according to the spatio-semantic context, and the demonstration is segmented into the task subsequences in an object-centric way. In comparison with the existing studies on unsupervised task segmentation, our work has the following distinct contribution: 1) the task provided as a video stream can be segmented without any pre-defined knowledge, 2) the trained features preserve spatio-semantic information so that the segmentation is object-centric. Our experiment shows that the recognition of the task subsequence can be applied to robot imitation for a sequential pick-and-place task by providing the semantic and location information of the object to be manipulated."
Mining transcriptome data to identify genes and pathways related to lemon taste using supervised and unsupervised data learning methods,2021,"['Attribute weighting algorithms', 'Citrus limon', 'Hierarchical clustering', 'Microarray analysis', 'Principal component analysis', 'Taste']",,"There is a dearth of studies on the genes engaged in citrus taste. Unraveling the major genes involved in pathways related to the taste of citrus (sweet or acidic) is highly important for developing new genotypes with favorable taste. Pivotal genes linked to citrus taste can be extracted through mining a large number of expression data. To attain this objective, 10 different attribute weighting algorithms (AWAs) were applied on the expression data from three lemon (Citrus limon) genotypes differing in terms of fruit acidity. As a result, a total of 170 probe sets were identified by more than eight AWAs as the most discriminative probe sets. Subsequently, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering heatmaps were implemented for validation of the 170 top-ranked probe sets. Noticeably, the identified top 170 probe sets significantly contributed to accurate discrimination between sweet and acidic lemon samples, which indicate the significance and accuracy of prediction of probe sets. According to the results, some genes like citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, proton-pumping ATPase, and flavanone 3-hydroxylase had distinct roles in differentiation of the studied genotypes and acidity. Among all of the genes, malate dehydrogenase was the most informative. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on identifying the most important genes contributing to lemon taste using supervised and unsupervised data learning methods."

Deep Learning Based Monocular Depth Estimation: Survey,2021,"['deep learning', 'depth estimation']",,"Monocular depth estimation helps the robot to understand the surrounding environments in 3D. Especially, deep-learning-based monocular depth estimation has been widely researched, because it may overcome the scale ambiguity problem, which is a main issue in classical methods. Those learning based methods can be mainly divided into three parts: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning. Supervised learning trains the network from dense ground-truth depth information, unsupervised one trains it from images sequences and semi-supervised one trains it from stereo images and sparse ground-truth depth. We describe the basics of each method, and then explain the recent research efforts to enhance the depth estimation performance."
DEMO: Deep MR Parametric Mapping with Unsupervised Multi-Tasking Framework,2021,"['Compressed sensing', 'Fast MR imaging', 'Parameter mapping', 'Unsupervised learning']",,"Compressed sensing (CS) has been investigated in magnetic resonance (MR) parametric mapping to reduce scan time. However, the relatively long reconstruction time restricts its widespread applications in the clinic. Recently, deep learningbased methods have shown great potential in accelerating reconstruction time and improving imaging quality in fast MR imaging, although their adaptation to parametric mapping is still in an early stage. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learningbased framework DEMO for fast and robust MR parametric mapping. Different from current deep learning-based methods, DEMO trains the network in an unsupervised way, which is more practical given that it is difficult to acquire large fully sampled training data of parametric-weighted images. Specifically, a CS-based loss function is used in DEMO to avoid the necessity of using fully sampled k-space data as the label, thus making it an unsupervised learning approach. DEMO reconstructs parametric weighted images and generates a parametric map simultaneously by unrolling an interaction approach in conventional fast MR parametric mapping, which enables multi-tasking learning. Experimental results showed promising performance of the proposed DEMO framework in quantitative MR T1ρ mapping."
Review on the Recent Welding Research with Application of CNN-Based Deep Learning Part I: Models and Applications,2021,"['Deep learning', 'Convolution Neural Network', 'Image', 'Welding', 'Model', 'Application']",,"During machine learning algorithms, deep learning refers to a neural network containing multiple hidden layers. Welding research based upon deep learning has been increasing due to advances in algorithms and computer hardwares. Among the deep learning algorithms, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has recently received the spotlight for performing classification or regression based on image input. CNNs enables end-to-end learning without feature extraction and in-situ estimation of the process outputs. In this paper, 18 recent papers were reviewed to investigate how to apply CNN models to welding. The papers was classified into 5 groups: four for supervised learning models and one for unsupervised learning models. The classification of supervised learning groups was based on the application of transfer learning and data augmentation. For each paper, the structure and performance of its CNN model were described, and also its application in welding was explained."
A Review of Optimal Energy Management Strategies Using Machine Learning Techniques for Hybrid Electric Vehicles,2021,"['Hybrid electric vehicle', 'Energy management strategy', 'Machine learning', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Optimal control theory']",,"A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is defined as a vehicle that has two or more power sources, the hybrid electric vehicle is a representative eco-friendly vehicle because it can operate efficiently with each power source and requires only a small sized electric power source. However, it is not possible to develop high efficiency HEVs without an effective energy management system (EMS), a well-designed EMS is vital in HEVs because they need to manage two power sources. Motivated by this, there are continuing efforts being made to research and establish suitable energy management strategies in order to develop high efficiency HEVs. In the past, many energy management strategies for HEVs were developed based on optimal control theory. Recently, various kinds of machine learning technologies have been applied to HEV EMS development based on breakthroughs in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning is a field of research that allows computers to perform arbitrary tasks guided by data rather than explicit programming. Machine learning can be classified into supervised learning, reinforcement learning (semi-supervised learning), and unsupervised learning depending on how the training data is structured. In this study, we look at cases and studies in which machine learning techniques from each category were used to develop HEV energy management strategies."

We propose a model that describes the process of human noise recognition at three stages of detection, memory, and recognition. We present data analysis methods for each stage, including density-based clustering in machine learning to examine the location of the interior noise, generated inside the car, recognized as important and heterogeneous for the driver. We use noise data from multiple locations measured by an acoustic camera that measures and shapes the sound at a specific location using a beamforming technique. Finally, numerical examples are given for verifying the algorithm presented in this paper. In addition, interior noise data is visualized using autoencoder, tSNE, and PCA in unsupervised feature learning. Since the algorithm presented is unsupervised learning, it is unnecessary to build large-scale training data. It is therefore advantageous in terms of data collection economy and application flexibility."

With the development of IoT technology and big data, automation of production systems has become possible. In the advanced manufacturing industry, production systems are subject to unscheduled performance degradation and downtime, and there is a demand to reduce safety risks by detecting and reparing potential errors as soon as possible. This study designs a model based on supervised and unsupervised learning for detecting anomalies.The accuracy of XGBoost, LightGBM, and CNN models was compared as a supervised learning analysis method.

AI 비지도 학습 기반의 학교폭력 예방 데이터 분석 시스템 개발,2021,"['K-means', 'AI']",,"School violence has long been recognized as a social problem, and various efforts have been made to prevent it. In this study, we propose a system that can prevent school violence by analyzing data on the frequency of conversations between students, friendship and preference to be in the same group. This data was quantified using a Likert scale questionnaire, and also grouped into the appropriate number of clusters using the K-means algorithm. Additionally, the homeroom teacher observed the frequency and nature of conversations between students, and targeted specific individuals or groups for counseling and intervention, with the aim of reducing school violence. Data analysis revealed that the teachers' qualitative observations were consistent with the quantified data based on student questionnaires, and therefore applicable as quantitative data towards the identification and understanding of student relationships within the classroom. The study has potential limitations. The data used is subjective and based on peer evaluations which can be inconsistent as the students may use different criteria to evaluate one another. It is expected that this study will help homeroom teachers in their efforts to prevent school violence by understanding the relationships between students within the classroom."

일치성규칙과 목표값이 없는 데이터 증대를 이용하는 학습의 성능 향상 방법에 관한 연구,2021,['JS-'],,"Semi-supervised learning uses both labeled data and unlabeled data. Recently consistency regularization is very popular in semi-supervised learning. Unsupervised data augmentation (UDA) that uses unlabeled data augmentation is also based on the consistency regularization. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is used for the loss of unlabeled data and cross-entropy for the loss of labeled data through UDA learning. UDA uses techniques such as training signal annealing (TSA) and confidence-based masking to promote performance. In this study, we propose to use Jensen-Shannon divergence instead of Kullback-Leibler divergence, reverse-TSA and not to use confidence-based masking for performance improvement. Through experiment, we show that the proposed technique yields better performance than those of UDA."
암의 이질성 분류를 위한 하이브리드 학습 기반 세포 형태 프로파일링 기법,2021,"['Hybrid learning', 'Deep convolutional neural network', 'Unsupervised clustering', 'Cell morphology', 'Cancer heterogeneity']",,"Heterogeneity in cancer is the major obstacle for precision medicine and has become a critical issue in the field of a cancer diagnosis. Many attempts were made to disentangle the complexity by molecular classification. However, multi-dimensional information from dynamic responses of cancer poses fundamental limitations on biomolecular marker-based conventional approaches. Cell morphology, which reflects the physiological state of the cell, can be used to track the temporal behavior of cancer cells conveniently. Here, we first present a hybrid learning-based platform that extracts cell morphology in a time-dependent manner using a deep convolutional neural network to incorporate multivariate data. Feature selection from more than 200 morphological features is conducted, which filters out less significant variables to enhance interpretation. Our platform then performs unsupervised clustering to unveil dynamic behavior patterns hidden from a high-dimensional dataset. As a result, we visualize morphology state-space by two-dimensional embedding as well as representative morphology clusters and trajectories. This cell morphology profiling strategy by hybrid learning enables simplification of the heterogeneous population of cancer."

자기 정규화를 통한 도메인 불변 특징 학습,2021,,,"Unsupervised domain adaptation often gives impressive solutions to handle domain shift of data. Most of current approaches assume that unlabeled target data to train is abundant. This assumption is not always true in practices. To tackle this issue, we propose a general solution to solve the domain gap minimization problem without any target data. Our method consists of two regularization steps. The first step is a pixel regularization by arbitrary style transfer. Recently, some methods bring style transfer algorithms to domain adaptation and domain generalization process. They use style transfer algorithms to remove texture bias in source domain data. We also use style transfer algorithms for removing texture bias, but our method depends on neither domain adaptation nor domain generalization paradigm. The second regularization step is a feature regularization by feature alignment. Adding a feature alignment loss term to the model loss, the model learns domain invariant representation more efficiently. We evaluate our regularization methods from several experiments both on small dataset and large dataset. From the experiments, we show that our model can learn domain invariant representation as much as unsupervised domain adaptation methods."

Practice and methodological implications of the findings were discussed."
투자자별 거래정보와 머신러닝을 활용한 투자전략의 성과,2021,"['투자자별 거래량 정보', '기계학습', '로보어드바이저', '트레이딩시스템', 'Investor-specific Transaction Information', 'Machine Learning', 'Robo-advisor', 'Trading System']",,"Stock market investors are generally split into foreign investors, institutional investors, and individual investors. Compared to individual investor groups, professional investor groups such as foreign investors have an advantage in information and financial power and, as a result, foreign investors are known to show good investment performance among market participants.  The purpose of this study is to propose an investment strategy that combines investor-specific transaction information and machine learning, and to analyze the portfolio investment performance of the proposed model using actual stock price and investor-specific transaction data. The Korea Exchange offers daily information on the volume of purchase and sale of each investor to securities firms. We developed a data collection program in C# programming language using an API provided by Daishin Securities Cybosplus, and collected 151 out of 200 KOSPI stocks with daily opening price, closing price and investor-specific net purchase data from January 2, 2007 to July 31, 2017.  The self-organizing map model is an artificial neural network that performs clustering by unsupervised learning and has been introduced by Teuvo Kohonen since 1984. We implement competition among intra-surface artificial neurons, and all connections are non-recursive artificial neural networks that go from bottom to top. It can also be expanded to multiple layers, although many fault layers are commonly used. Linear functions are used by active functions of artificial nerve cells, and learning rules use Instar rules as well as general competitive learning. The core of the backpropagation model is the model that performs classification by supervised learning as an artificial neural network.  We grouped and transformed investor-specific transaction volume data to learn backpropagation models through the self-organizing map model of artificial neural networks. As a result of the estimation of verification data through training, the portfolios were rebalanced monthly. For performance analysis, a passive portfolio was designated and the KOSPI 200 and KOSPI index returns for proxies on market returns were also obtained.  Performance analysis was conducted using the equally-weighted portfolio return, compound interest rate, annual return, Maximum Draw Down, standard deviation, and Sharpe Ratio. Buy and hold returns of the top 10 market capitalization stocks are designated as a benchmark. Buy and hold strategy is the best strategy under the efficient market hypothesis. The prediction rate of learning data using backpropagation model was significantly high at 96.61%, while the prediction rate of verification data was also relatively high in the results of the 57.1% verification data. The performance evaluation of self-organizing map grouping can be determined as a result of a backpropagation model. This is because if the grouping results of the self-organizing map model had been poor, the learning results of the backpropagation model would have been poor. In this way, the performance assessment of machine learning is judged to be better learned than previous studies.  Our portfolio doubled the return on the benchmark and performed better than the market returns on the KOSPI and KOSPI 200 indexes. In contrast to the benchmark, the MDD and standard deviation for portfolio risk indicators also showed better results. The Sharpe Ratio performed higher than benchmarks and stock market indexes. Through this, we presented the direction of portfolio composition program using machine learning and investor-specific transaction information and showed that it can be used to develop programs for real stock investment.  The return is the result of monthly portfolio composition and asset rebalancing to the same proportion. Better outcomes are predicted when forming a monthly portfolio if the system is enforced by rebalancing the suggested stocks continuously without selling and re-buying it."

Recently, AI-based methods have received a lot of attention and so-called supervised learning methods that require classification information for data are mainly used. This supervised learning method requires a lot of time and costs because classification information (label) must be manually designated for all data required for learning. In this study, an autoencoder based on unsupervised learning was applied as an outlier detection to overcome this problem. For the experiment, two experiments were designed: one is univariate learning, in which only SST data was used among the observation data of Deokjeok Island and the other is multivariate learning, in which SST, air temperature, wind direction, wind speed, air pressure, and humidity were used. Period of data is 25 years from 1996 to 2020, and a pre-processing considering the characteristics of ocean data was applied to the data. An outlier detection of actual SST data was tried with a learned univariate and multivariate autoencoder. We tried to detect outliers in real SST data using trained univariate and multivariate autoencoders. To compare model performance, various outlier detection methods were applied to synthetic data with artificially inserted errors. As a result of quantitatively evaluating the performance of these methods, the multivariate/univariate accuracy was about 96%/91%, respectively, indicating that the multivariate autoencoder had better outlier detection performance. Outlier detection using an unsupervised learning-based autoencoder is expected to be used in various ways in that it can reduce subjective classification errors and cost and time required for data labeling."

The timely supply of repair parts has a direct impact on weapons systems. Therefore, a demand forecast for repair parts has become a very important factor in terms of budget and equipment utilization. To improve the prediction limits with the time series model currently being applied in the Airforce, several studies focused on improving the prediction rates by adding new external variables through supervised learning. Research on improving the predictive accuracy through unsupervised learning and feature engineering has been limited. In this study, the consumption and standard unit price data of 5,752 repair accessory items from 2014 to 2019 were collected for F-15K fighter jets operated by the Airforce. In this study, the data-mining model (Randomforest, GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet regression) was used to compare the time series models with the prediction rate. The predictive power scale was RMSE (mean square root error). This study showed that data mining models have higher prediction accuracy than the time series prediction model currently applied in the Airforce. In addition, dimensionality reduction and feature engineering improve the prediction accuracy further."

In particular, with the advances of blind denoising techniques, it become possible to train a deep learning-based denoising model only with noisy images in an image domain where it is impossible to obtain a clean image. We no longer require pairs of a clean image and a noisy image to obtain a restored clean image from the observation. However, it is difficult to recover the target using a deep learning-based denoising model trained by only noisy images if the distribution of the noisy image is far from the distribution of the clean image. To address this limitation, unpaired image denoising approaches have recently been studied that can learn the denoising model from unpaired data of the noisy image and the clean image. ISCL showed comparable performance close to that of supervised learning-based models based on pairs of clean and noisy images. In this study, we propose suitable normalization techniques for each purpose of architectures (e.g., generator, discriminator, and extractor) of ISCL. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unpaired image denoising approaches including ISCL."

To solve these problems, in this paper, we evaluate the performance of an underwater acoustic communication model using a denoising auto-encoder used for unsupervised learning. Noise images generated by the underwater multipath channel were collected and used as training data. Experimental results were analyzed as a PSNR parameter that expressed the noise ratio of the two images."

We investigate the characteristics and the defects of the modified Hebbian rules suggested previously.

In such high-dimensional cases, it is common to perform tandem analysis, $K$-means cluster analysis after reducing the number of variables using dimension reduction methods. However, there is no guarantee that the reduced dimension reveals the cluster structure properly. Principal component analysis may mask the structure of clusters, especially when there are large variances for variables that are not related to cluster structure. To overcome this, techniques that perform dimension reduction and cluster analysis simultaneously have been suggested. This study proposes probabilistic reduced $K$-means, the transition of reduced $K$-means (De Soete and Caroll, 1994) into a probabilistic framework. Simulation shows that the proposed method performs better than tandem clustering or clustering without any dimension reduction. When the number of the variables is larger than the number of samples in each cluster, probabilistic reduced $K$-means show better formation of clusters than non-probabilistic reduced $K$-means.

The clustering models in an unsupervised way classify the templates into a several clusters. Our system that verifies the soundness of requirements specification has been developed in the basis of clusters.

Otherwise, it autonomically returns the most similar template recommended by k-means clustering algorithm. We have tested our system to verify both cases.

It is embedded with a new tactic to recapture the K value and new initial seedings computation to kick off the system until it converges. Force components of cutting force F c , thrust force F t and perpendicular cutting force F cn were extracted from Neo-MoMac cutting force measurement device. The analysis threshold represents a natural-sorted input vector as Z -rot coefficient ( R Z ) corresponds to the number of cutting accomplish a strong correlation ( R 2 = 0.8511) over wear evolution. The clustering system adopted a new calculation of initial centroids has successfully determined the three regions for only a single assignment and achieving the optimal distance squared through eight given data sets.

During the course, F-Km delivered robust and consistence clustering results of 85% accuracy over standard K-means and four times converges faster than K-means + + . The silhouette value average score is 0.8504 (highest score is 0.9207) of how well-distributed the resulting clusters. The clustering system has identified the tool to stop cutting at approximate VB = 0.213 mm before the tool condition enters the failure region of abnormal phase ( VB < 0.250 mm ).s The proposed system functioned effectively in clustering the data obtained from cutting tests performed within a reasonable range of wear stages. Precision and robustness analysis have proved F-km to score 100% attainment for clustering assignment output and replicability. In contrast, K-means scored 76.3% for precision and ranging from 5 to 33% for robustness. Whereas, K-means + + scored 33% for robustness and a higher chance of time complexity compared to F-km. F-Km is found to be more accurate, time savvy and robust than standard K-means and K-means + + .

In this study, we propose a system that can prevent school violence by analyzing data on the frequency of conversations between students, friendship and preference to be in the same group. This data was quantified using a Likert scale questionnaire, and also grouped into the appropriate number of clusters using the K-means algorithm. Additionally, the homeroom teacher observed the frequency and nature of conversations between students, and targeted specific individuals or groups for counseling and intervention, with the aim of reducing school violence. Data analysis revealed that the teachers’ qualitative observations were consistent with the quantified data based on student questionnaires, and therefore applicable as quantitative data towards the identification and understanding of student relationships within the classroom. The study has potential limitations. The data used is subjective and based on peer evaluations which can be inconsistent as the students may use different criteria to evaluate one another. It is expected that this study will help homeroom teachers in their efforts to prevent school violence by understanding the relationships between students within the classroom."
Human Laughter Generation using Hybrid Generative Models,2021,"['Laughter Synthesis', 'Variational Autoencoder', 'Autoencoder', 'Objective and Subjective Evaluation']",,"Laughter is one of the most important nonverbal sound that human generates. It is a means for expressing his emotions. The acoustic and contextual features of this specific sound are different from those of speech and many difficulties arise during their modeling process. During this work, we propose an audio laughter generation system based on unsupervised generative models: the autoencoder (AE) and its variants. This procedure is the association of three main sub-process, (1) the analysis which consist of extracting the log magnitude spectrogram from the laughter database, (2) the generative models training, (3) the synthesis stage which incorporate the involvement of an intermediate mechanism: the vocoder. To improve the synthesis quality, we suggest two hybrid models (LSTM-VAE, GRU-VAE and CNN-VAE) that combine the representation learning capacity of variational autoencoder (VAE) with the temporal modelling ability of a long short-term memory RNN (LSTM) and the CNN ability to learn invariant features. To figure out the performance of our proposed audio laughter generation process, objective evaluation (RMSE) and a perceptual audio quality test (listening test) were conducted. According to these evaluation metrics, we can show that the GRU-VAE outperforms the other VAE models."
텍스트 마이닝에 의한 문학 작품 분류,2021,"['text mining', 'classification', 'clustering', 'cosain similarity', 'children’s novel', '텍스트 마이닝', '분류분석', '코사인 유사도', '군집분석', '아동소설']",,"This paper is to introduce quantitative text analysis of some literary works registered in the Project Gutenberg among Big Data and classification of the works using text mining techniques. After performing data preprocessing using the programming language R, we measured cosine similarity between chapters within a novel and cosine similarity between chapters of different novels to classify the novels. We found the cosine similarity between chapters within the novel is relatively high, but not between the novels. Furthermore, clustering analysis, which is an unsupervised machine learning task, showed strong cohesion of semantic distance, and classification analysis, which is a supervised machine learning task, showed high accuracy. In addition, we have confirmed that children's novels can be classified as easy-to-read works due to the large cosine similarity value and small semantic distance between chapters. Therefore, quantitative text analysis using text mining technique is expected to serve as a foundation for performing qualitative text analysis."
Combating disaster prone zone by prioritizing attributes with hybrid clustering and ANP approach,2021,"['Disaster management', 'Clustering', 'Tropical storms', 'Vulnerability', 'Data mining']",,"Due to a lack of assets and high improbability, developing an information system for every disaster situation is a challenging task. Consequently, building an information system for such a situation is essential, and the latest research direction has emphasized on development of such a system which varies due to the irregular nature of environments. This work emphasizes the data mining technique based on available disaster data or the earlier prediction of such occurrences to combat damages. The data mining technique is applied to the clustering of data for smooth processes of the obtained data. K-means clustering and analytic network process (ANP) are implemented as unsupervised learning for initial data and to find groups in the data, clustered based on feature similarity.The proposed approach implies an effective tool for predicting impacts in terms of hazards and this paper also evaluates its effectiveness. This study offers important insights into the disaster recovery practitioner to select the best disaster recovery solution and prioritize them for their enterprise."

YouTube's personalized recommendation service system consists of two neural networks, one neural network consisting of a recommendation candidate generation model and the other consisting of a ranking network. Netflix's video recommendation system consists of two data classification systems, divided into content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. As the online platform-led content production is activated by the Corona Pandemic, the field of virtual influencers using artificial intelligence is emerging. Virtual influencers are produced with GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) artificial intelligence, and are unsupervised learning algorithms in which two opposing systems compete with each other. This study also researched the possibility of developing AI platform based on individual recommendation and virtual influencer (metabus) as a core content of OTT in the future."

In this study, we analyzed the spatial distribution of heavy users using SDE(Standard Deviational Ellipse), a spatial distribution analysis technique for point data. In addition, based on the results of SDE, cluster analysis, an unsupervised learning method of machine learning, is applied to classify heavy users spatial distribution types and analyze their features. The significance of this study can be found in that it proposed a method to identify the characteristics of spatial distribution for social media users using SDE."

Building Energy Time Series Data Mining for Behavior Analytics and Forecasting Energy consumption,2021,"['ehavioral Analytics', 'Big Data Mining', 'Clustering Analysis', 'CNN', 'Energy Consumption', 'Energy Prediction', 'LSTM']",,"The significant aim of this research has always been to evaluate the mechanism for efficient and inherently aware usage of vitality in-home devices, thus improving the information of smart metering systems with regard to the usage of selected homes and the time of use. Advances in information processing are commonly used to quantify gigantic building activity data steps to boost the activity efficiency of the building energy systems. Here, some smart data mining models are offered to measure, and predict the time series for energy in order to expose different ephemeral principles for using energy. Such considerations illustrate the use of machines in relation to time, such as day hour, time of day, week, month and year relationships within a family unit, which are key components in gathering and separating the effect of consumers behaviors in the use of energy and their pattern of energy prediction. It is necessary to determine the multiple relations through the usage of different appliances from simultaneous information flows. In comparison, specific relations among interval-based instances where multiple appliances use continue for certain duration are difficult to determine. In order to resolve these difficulties, an unsupervised energy time-series data clustering and a frequent pattern mining study as well as a deep learning technique for estimating energy use were presented. A broad test using true data sets that are rich in smart meter data were conducted. The exact results of the appliance designs that were recognized by the proposed model were filled out by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM and GRU) at each stage, with consolidated accuracy of 94.79%, 97.99%, 99.61%, for 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively."

The journal of Economic and Environmental Geology (EEG) has a long history of over 52 years and published interdisciplinary articles based on geology. In this study, we performed a literature review using topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised machine learning model, to identify geological topics, historical trends (classic topics and emerging topics), and association by analyzing titles, keywords, and abstracts of 2,571 publications in EEG during 1968-2020. The results showed that 8 topics (‘petrology and geochemistry’, ‘hydrology and hydrogeology’, ‘economic geology’, ‘volcanology’, ‘soil contaminant and remediation’, ‘general and structural geology’, ‘geophysics and geophysical exploration’, and ‘clay mineral’) were identified in the EEG. Before 1994, classic topics (‘economic geology’, ‘volcanology’, and ‘general and structure geology’) were dominant research trends. After 1994, emerging topics (‘hydrology and hydrogeology’, ‘soil contaminant and remediation’, ‘clay mineral’) have arisen, and its portion has gradually increased. The result of association analysis showed that EEG tends to be more comprehensive based on ‘economic geology’. Our results provide understanding of how geological research topics branch out and merge with other fields using a useful literature review tool for geological research in South Korea."
