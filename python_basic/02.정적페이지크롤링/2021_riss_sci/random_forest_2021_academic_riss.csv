The purpose of this study is to identify the ideal combination of movie scenarios by defining the types of movies preferred by the audience as a rule based on the user’s rating data using a random forest. Therefore, this paper tried to interpret the movie scenario conditions that determine the success or failure of a movie in terms of 18 genres and age groups as rules according to audience ratings. In addition, the usefulness(frequency) and reliability(error) of the rule composed of scenario conditions and outcomes (success and failure) were used as the criteria for selecting the desired combination of genre and target age group. The research results and contents are as follows. First, rules with high reliability were calculated by generating a large number of rules using the Random Forest algorithm consisting of several decision trees. Second, the practicality of the selected rules was improved by generalizing the rules by removing unnecessary conditions in the rules. Second, practical rules were created by generalizing the rules by removing unnecessary conditions in the rules. Third, by grouping rules containing common elements, it was possible to interpret more extensively than the meaning of a single rule. Based on these research results, it is expected that the defined rules can become a cornerstone for successful film scenario construction. In addition, this study is meaningful as a convergence study of film art and data science because the organic relationship of each film element was derived through a data mining technique, Random Forest."
Towards fine-scale population stratification modeling based on kernel principal component analysis and random forest,2021,"['Association study', 'Kernel principal component analysis', 'Population stratification', 'Random forest']",,"Background Population stratifcation modeling is essential in Genome-Wide Association Studies.Objective In this paper, we aim to build a fne-scale population stratifcation model to efciently infer individual genetic ancestry.Methods Kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and random forest are adopted to build the population stratifcation model, together with parameter optimization. We explore diferent PCA methods, including standard PCA and kernel PCA to extract relevant features from the genotype data that is transformed by vcf2geno, a pipeline from LASER software. These extracted features are fed into a random forest for ensemble learning. Parameter tuning is performed to jointly fnd the optimal number of principal components, kernel function for PCA and parameters of the random forest.Results Experiments based on HGDP dataset show that kernel PCA with Sigmoid function and Gaussian function can achieve higher prediction accuracy than the standard PCA. Compared to standard PCA with the two principal components, the accuracy by using KPCA-Sigmoid with the optimal number of principal components can achieve around 100% and 200% improvement for East Asian and European populations, respectively.Conclusion With the optimal parameter confguration on both PCA and random forest, our proposed method can infer the individual genetic ancestry more accurately, given their variants."

A Preliminary Report on the Random Forests Approach for the Comparison of English and Korean Focus Prosody,2021,"['영어', '한국어', '발화', '운율 초점', '랜덤 포레스트', 'English', 'Korean', 'production', 'prosodic focus', 'random forests']",,"By conducting a production experiment, this study aimed at examining focus prosody in English and Korean to identify the similarities and differences between the two languages. Six native speakers of each language participated in the production experiment and produced target sentences that contained either broad focus and discourse-new focus constituents. The two focus types (that is, broad vs. discourse-new) were directly compared for acoustic analysis. A series of random forests analysis was also conducted to determine which acoustic cue was most important in distinguishing discourse-new focus from broad focus in each language and to spot the most important cue contributing to the differences between English and Korean focus prosody. The results revealed that discourse-new focus realized with sufficient prominence was clearly distinguished from broad focus in each language, supporting the claim that a focused element is maximally prominent within a sentence (Truckenbrodt 1995). However, the findings of the random forests analysis demonstrated that different cues behaved differently in the focus prosody of each language. This study, therefore, argues that the way to realize focus prosody is not uniform across languages, mainly because of languages’ different prosodic structures."
Intelligent Model for the Compressibility Prediction of Cement-Stabilized Dredged Soil Based on Random Forest Regression Algorithm,2021,"['Random forest regression algorithm', 'Support vector machine', 'Cement-stabilized dredged soil', 'Compression index', 'Initial void ratio', 'Feature importance']",,"The determination of the compression characteristics of cement-stabilized dredged soil is an important issue. However, conventional method of laboratory compression test is time-consuming. Considering its robustness, random forest (RF) regression algorithm was utilized in this research to predict the compressibility of cement-stabilized dredge soil. The input variables included fundamental physical parameters of uncemented soil, water/cement ratio, and cement content. The output variables were initial void ratio e0 and compression index Csat the pre-yield state, which can be used to describe the compression curve. Furthermore, acomparative analysis between the RF and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms was implemented, and variable importance was also evaluated according to the RF model. Results indicate that the RF model could quickly predict Cs and e0 values of cement-stabilized dredged soil without one-dimensional oedometer tests. The RF algorithm was found to exhibit better performance than the SVM algorithm, and it has a strong ability to avoid over-fitting. The determination coefficient R2 for Cs and e0 on the validation set were found to respectively reach 0.83 and 0.97. Moreover, the importance values of the initial water content, water/cement ratio, and plastic limit were found to be 0.313, 0.249, and 0.117, respectively. The secant compression modulus Es1-2 obtained from the compression curves could be applied to the calculation of settlement and stress in engineering design."
Development of Random Forest Algorithm Based Prediction Model of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Neurodegeneration Pattern,2021,"['Random forest', 'Alzheimer’s disease', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Segmentation', 'MRI']",,"Objective Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and the prevalence rapidly increased as the elderly population increased worldwide. In the contemporary model of AD, it is regarded as a disease continuum involving preclinical stage to severe dementia. For accurate diagnosis and disease monitoring, objective index reflecting structural change of brain is needed to correctly assess a patient’s severity of neurodegeneration independent from the patient’s clinical symptoms. The main aim of this paper is to develop a random forest (RF) algorithm-based prediction model of AD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and performance of our RF based prediction model using newly developed brain segmentation method compared with the Freesurfer’s which is a commonly used segmentation software. Results Our RF model showed high diagnostic accuracy for differentiating healthy controls from AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using structural MRI, patient characteristics, and cognitive function (HC vs. AD 93.5%, AUC 0.99; HC vs. MCI 80.8%, AUC 0.88). Moreover, segmentation processing time of our algorithm (<5 minutes) was much shorter than of Freesurfer’s (6-8 hours). Conclusion Our RF model might be an effective automatic brain segmentation tool which can be easily applied in real clinical practice."

The performance of the RF model was found reliable and faster in predicting the crop yield with the most influencing variables with 69%, 60% and 39% of coefficient of determination (R2) in the final yield for September, December and February months, respectively using CART decision tree and recursive feature elimination method in R programming.Results showed as RF algorithm has the capability to integrate and process a large number of inputs as derived from different satellite modalities, unscaled and non-uniform ground based information, expert knowledge, etc.With high precision and avoid over fitting of the model."
Strip Crown Prediction in Hot Rolling Process Using Random Forest,2021,['Hot rolling · Strip crown · Ensemble method · Random forest'],,"This paper established a model based on an ensemble method to predict strip crown using 230,000 coils of data obtained from a hot rolling line. Before modeling, a specific method was proposed to reduce noise and remove outliers, and a new dataset of 5657 samples was generated. Parameter tuning considering mean squared error (MSE) was carried out to establish three machine learning models including support vector machine (SVC), regression tree (RT), and random forest (RF). Determination coefficient (R 2 ), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were used as indicators to evaluate the prediction of models. Results showed that the RF had the best performance with the highest R 2 of 0.707, as well as the lowest RMSE of 5.66 μm. Moreover, an additional method that repeated the three models 100 times was developed, and box plots were used to visualize the distribution of R 2 , MAE and RMSE. RF can correct for decision trees to reduce overfitting to their training set, improving the generalization, and in this paper, the trained RF which had stable performance is considered as the most recommended model. After that, for RF, rankings of rolling process variable were validated to make a comparison with the existing physical understanding"
Preoperative hyperlactatemia and early mortality after liver transplantation: selection of important variables using random forest survival analysis,2021,"['Early mortality', 'Lactate', 'Liver transplantation', 'Random survival.']",,"Background: Generally, lactate levels > 2 mmol/L represent hyperlactatemia, whereas lactic acidosis is often defined as lactate > 4 mmol/L. Although hyperlactatemia is common finding in liver transplant (LT) candidates, association between lactate and organ failures with Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) is poorly studied. We searched the important variables for pre-LT hyperlactatemia and examined the impact of preoperative hyperlactatemia on early mortality after LT. Methods: A total of 2,002 patients from LT registry between January 2008 and February 2019 were analyzed. Six organ failures (liver, kidney, brain, coagulation, circulation, and lung) were defined by criteria of EASL-CLIF ACLF Consortium. Variable importance of preoperative hyperlactatemia was examined by machine learning using random survival forest (RSF). Kaplan-Meier Survival curve analysis was performed to assess 90-day mortality.Results: Median lactate level was 1.9 mmol/L (interquartile range: 1.4, 2.4 mmol/L) and 107 (5.3%) patients showed > 4.0 mmol/L. RSF analysis revealed that the four most important variables for hyperlactatemia were MELD score, circulatory failure, hemoglobin, and respiratory failure. The 30-day and 90-day mortality rates were 2.7% and 5.1%, whereas patients with lactate > 4.0 mmol/L showed increased rate of 15.0% and 19.6%, respectively. Conclusion: About 50% and 5% of LT candidates showed pre-LT hyperlactatemia of > 2.0 mmol/L and > 4.0 mmol/L, respectively. Pre-LT lactate > 4.0 mmol/L was associated with increased early post-LT mortality. Our results suggest that future study of correcting modifiable risk factors may play a role in preventing hyperlactatemia and lowering early mortality after LT."

Forest-based livelihood choices and their determinants in Western Kenya,2021,"['Livelihoods', 'forest extraction', 'rural households', 'double hurdle model', 'Kenya']",,"Forest extraction is an important livelihood activity for millions of low-income households in rural areas of developing countries. Understanding the choices households make to extract forest products can help formulate strategies for preventing livelihood strains associated with forest degradation. This article evaluates the nature, extent and determinants of forest extraction among rural households in western Kenya. Data were obtained from a survey of 924 randomly selected households in the Mt. Elgon area in western Kenya. The level of forest extraction was measured as the aggregate value of products extracted, while a Double Hurdle model was applied to assess the factors influencing forest extraction. The results show that the choice to engage in forest-based livelihood was generally higher among households with lower asset value, membership in forest user associations, and headed by males. The results further show that although the majority of households’ engaging in forest-based livelihood were of the lowest wealth category, households in the middle wealth category were found to extract higher value products. Institutional characteristics, including access to agricultural markets, credit, extension, and membership to forest user groups, increased the likelihood of households’ extracting higher value products. Overall, the results show that in addition to asset endowment, other contextual factors, such as access to markets, agricultural extension, and membership to farmer groups defined whether a household extracted forest products for survival or accumulation."

They are responsible to establish good governance, sustainable forest management and improve people's livelihoods. The study aimed to assess the governance score prevailing in CFUGs using stratified random sampling. Our study shows the governance score of 64.17% in community forests with highest 73.94% in Bhotechaur community forest and lowest 56.60% in Tinkanya community forest. Among the eight elements of good governance, consensus-oriented was found highest while responsiveness was lowest in the study area. Further, the independent variables such as well-being ranking (χ<sup>2</sup>=21.695, df=6, p<0.01), source of income (χ<sup>2</sup>=20.474, df=6, p<0.01) and education status (χ<sup>2</sup>=17.450, df=6, p<0.01) has significant impact on governance. Based upon the findings, it is very clear that good governance in CFs are more than average but still not up to the mark. Finally, it calls for rethinking that involving all the stakeholders during planning phases delineating the responsibility and power for correspondents can make possible in achieving sustainability in community forest."

The accurate estimation of the debris flow hazard zone is a critical factor of the successful early-warning and evacuation for reducing the debris flow risk. Korea Forest Service has developed a debris flow hazard map using Random Walk Model (RWM). Meanwhile, because check dams in forest watersheds capture discharged debris, the effect of check dams should be considered for mapping the debris flow hazard zone. This study analyzed the effect of check dams on debris flow discharge using RWM with the check dam module. As a result, RWM seems to simulate the sediment capture by check dams. However, the total deposit areas were not significantly different despite the effect of check dams because of input parameters and the flow direction calculation algorithm of RWM. Further studies on appropriate spatial resolution and initial sediment volume should be conducted to improve the debris flow hazard map."

The present study was carried out for quantitative analysis of diversity, population structure, regeneration and conservation status of tree species in the four 36.86 ha sacred groves of Jhargram district in West Bengal. Tree species composition, population structure and regeneration status were analyzed by randomly establishing of 1 ha subplots within the sacred groves. Density, frequency, basal area, abundance, evenness, and other diversity indices were calculated for adult trees with girth at breast height (GBH) >31 cm. A total of 146 tree species belonging to 116 genera distributed in 44 families from 21 orders were recorded. Pterospermum suberifolium, family Malvaceae showed the highest Species Importance Value Index (SIVI, 21.33) and Fabaceae showed the highest Family Importance Value Index (FIVI, 35.59) values respectively. Individuals are categorised into three groups, seedling, sapling and adult based on girth classes. The majority of tree species exhibited good (52.74%) regeneration followed by fairly (24.66%), poor (15.75%) and no regeneration (6.85%) respectively. With the healthy existence of the sacred grove, the overall population structure of tree species showed a strong regeneration potential. The current data will be useful in determining the current status of tree species and will be used by the forest department, politicians, and conservationists to establish management plans for the conservation of priority species in the region.

The experiment was designed in Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with four replications. Different sized polybags showed significant influence on survival percentage (T1-100%, T2-93.5%, T3-88%) and growth parameters (height, root collar diameter, leave number and root length) of the seedlings. The species grown in T1 size polybag was observed to be superior to other bag size. Dickson’s Quality index of seedlings raised in T1 size polybag was observed highest value which is the indicator of best quality seedlings. Therefore, the use of T1 poly bag size can be suggested for seedling production of K. anthotheca in the nursery."

The purpose of this study was to determine the proper dose of gamma-ray irradiation (60Co) to increase the decreased vigor of suren (Toona sureni (Blume) Merr.) seeds. This study uses a factorial completely randomized design (CRD) with aging and irradiation as the treatments. Aging factors consisted of 0, 2, and 4 days. Irradiation factor consisted of 7 levels, namely 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100 Gy, repeated four times. The parameters observed were the electrical conductivity, germination percentage, germination speed, and seedling height. The results showed that Seed aging treatment significantly affected Suren seed germination with 75% (2 days aging) and 56% (4 days aging) germination. The 40 Gy dose of gamma-ray irradiation could increase germination percentage and germination speed of low suren seed vigor increasing 51.42% and 60.21%, respectively. Simultaneously, the cell membrane damage of stored suren increased with gamma-ray irradiation treatment of more than 40 Gy based on electrical conductivity. In seeds with high germination, such as seeds without aging and seed aging for two days with a germination percentage of 80% and 75%, respectively, the invigoration treatment was not effective. Invigoration treatment was effective in increasing the deteriorated or low viability and vigor of the suren seeds."

Methods The analysis used the 2019 Career Education Status Survey data. 7,501 elementary school students were used to analyze Latent Profiles for career development competencies and Random Rorest analysis of 35 predictors. Information indices (AIC, BIC, SABIC), quality of classification (Entropy), and model comparison verification (BLRT_p) were used for Latent Profile classification, and importance indices were analyzed using MDA in Random Forest. Results Career development competencies of elementary school students were classified into “best competency,” “high competency,” “normal competency,” and “low competency” according to their level. In Random Forest analysis, learning motivation and learning attitude were important predictive factors in career development competencies, such as learning enjoyment, self-modification of learning methods, thoughts on effective learning methods, future-helpful study orientation, and problem-solving. Conclusions In order to enhance career development competencies, it is necessary to pay attention to psychological and emotional factors such as learning motivation and learning attitude along with various career development activities or program operations and reflect them in career education."
랜덤포레스트를 위한 상관예측변수 중요도,2021,,,"Random forests is a popular method that improves the instability and accuracy of decision trees by ensembles. In contrast to increasing the accuracy, the ease of interpretation is sacrificed; hence, to compensate for this, variable importance is provided. The variable importance indicates which variable plays a role more importantly in constructing the random forests. However, when a predictor is correlated with other predictors, the variable importance of the existing importance algorithm may be distorted. The downward bias of correlated predictors may reduce the importance of truly important predictors. We propose a new algorithm remedying the downward bias of correlated predictors. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by the simulated data and illustrated by the real data."

The paper investigates the relationship between the random forest model and the complexities of housing market. Based on the findings, various qualitative analyses has been attempted for effective model design. The findings are summarized as followed;-. First, the random forest model is performative in capturing the non-linearity from sub-market and locational effects. The random forest model has significantly low average percentage error (approx. 4%) compared to with a linear Hedonic model (approx. 11%). Second, the random forest model can efficiently capture the locational effects only with locational information (coordinates), without proxy variables. Third, using dummy variables may reduce explanatory power of the model, compared to label indexes because the number of variables included in an operation increases. Fourth, the advantage from model complexity seems overwhelm the disadvantage from overfitting. Fifth, modellers are not required to ensure consistency in the time periods contained in a dataset."

For this purpose, the 7th data of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing(KLoSA) was used, and a total of 60 variables including the life satisfaction of older adults were finally used for the analysis. The explanatory variables were largely composed of demographic background, family (children and grandchildren, parents and siblings), health, employment, income and consumption, assets, and subjective expectations. For the analysis method, random forest was used to derive variables with high importance among 59 explanatory variables, and multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship between major variables and life satisfaction. The main results are as follows. First, a random forest analysis using 500 trees and 13 split variables showed that the degree of depression, average monthly allowance, subjective perception of social hierarchy, life expectancy, subjective health, number of grandchildren, age, job expectation, personal wealth, total amount of money received. The relative importance of the 10 variables was the highest. Second, as a result of analyzing the partial dependence on life satisfaction of older adults according to the top 10 variables of importance, the patterns of influence on life satisfaction by each variable were very different. Third, as a result of performing multiple regression analysis by inputting the top 10 variables of importance, it was found that the monthly average pocket money had the greatest influence on life satisfaction, followed by subjective perception of social hierarchy, subjective health, and life expectancy. However, these results may be slightly different from the partial dependence results, indicating that not only regression analysis but also partial dependence analysis should be considered in order to comprehensively examine the effects of related variables on life satisfaction of older adults. Based on the above results, the recommendations of this study are as follows. First, research on the lives of older adults needs to be analyzed from a more comprehensive perspective. Second, in addition to the current working status used in the analysis of this study, additional analysis is needed on the variables related to employment of older adults.

Most depression-related data mining and machine learning studies have been conducted to predict the presence of depression or to derive individual risk factors. However, since depression is caused by a combination of various factors, it is necessary to identify the complex relationship between the factors in order to establish effective anti-depression and management measures. In this study, we propose a methodology for identifying and interpreting patterns of depression expressions using the method of deriving random forest rules, where the random forest rule consists of the condition for the manifestation of the depressive pattern and the prediction result of depression when the condition is met. The analysis was carried out by subdividing into 4 groups in consideration of the different depressive patterns according to gender and age. Depression rules derived by the proposed methodology were validated by comparing them with the results of previous studies. Also, through the AUC comparison test, the depression diagnosis performance of the derived rules was evaluated, and it was not different from the performance of the existing PHQ-9 summing method. The significance of this study can be found in that it enabled the interpretation of the complex relationship between depressive factors beyond the existing studies that focused on prediction and deduction of major factors."

The worst flood situation in urban area can be occurred with difficulties of structural measures such as river levees, discharge capacity of urban sewage, storage basin of storm water, and pump facilities. However, identifying in advance the spatial flood information can have a decisive effect on minimizing flood damage. Therefore, this study presents a methodology that can predict the urban flood map in real-time by using rainfall data of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), the results of two-dimensional flood analysis and random forest (RF) regression model. The Ujeong district in Ulsan metropolitan city, which the flood is frequently occurred, was selected for the study area.

Statistical techniques and machine learning methods allow us to identify and focus on fundamental environmental variables that have close relationships with NPS pollutants of interest. This study developed surrogate models to predict the concentrations of suspended sediment (SS) and total phosphorus (T-P) from turbidity and runoff discharge rates using multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) methods. The RF models provided acceptable performance in predicting SS and T-P, especially when runoff discharge rates were high. The RF models outperformed the MLR models in all the cases. Such finding highlights the potential of RF techniques and models as a tool to identify fundamental environmental variables that are measured in relatively inexpensive ways or freely available but still able to provide information required to quantify the concentrations of NPS pollutants. The analysis of relative importance rates showed that the temporal variations of SS and T-P concentrations could be more effectively explained by that of turbidity than runoff discharge rate. This study demonstrated that the advanced statistical techniques such as machine learning could help to improve the efficiency of NPS pollutants monitoring."

Upland crops are directly exposed to the natural environment because they are mainly grown in mountainous areas. Therefore, it is necessary to provide accurate weather for upland crops. This study examined the effectiveness of 1 2 forest soil factors to interpolate the weather in mountainous areas. The daily temperature and precipitation were collected by the Korea Meteorological Administration between January 2009 and December 2018. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Kriging, and Random Forest (RF) were considered to interpolate. For evaluating the interpolation performance, automatic weather stations were used as training data and automated synoptic observing systems were used as test data for cross-validation. Unfortunately, the forest soil factors were not significant to interpolate the weather in the mountainous areas. GAM with only geography aspects showed that it can interpolate well in terms of root mean squared error and mean absolute error. The significance of the factors was tested at the 5% significance level in GAM, and the climate zone code (CLZN_CD) and soil water code B (SIBFLR_LAR) were identified as relatively important factors.

From two layers of soil collected with a vertical difference of 10 cm, 934 specimens of 27 families, 40 genera, 44 species, three varieties, and 47 taxa, germinated. Although species diversity and germination density decreased in most comparative characteristics, including growth type, there was no statistical significance due to large deviations. Within-group variability of species composition was similar in the upper and lower soils, as was the decline pattern in co-occurred species (ζ-diversity) and change in species retention probability. The structuring process of the community composition in the two soil layers was fitted with an exponential correlation rather than a power function, demonstrating the dominance of the stochastic process. The pattern in diversity and species turnover according to soil depth in Gwangneung Forest was discovered to be structured by stochastic random events, such as seed vertical movement rather than interaction with trait characteristics."

Research to detect malware continues to this day, and in recent years, research on malware detection and analysis using AI is focused. However, the AI algorithm has a disadvantage that it cannot explain why it detects and classifies malware. XAI techniques have emerged to overcome these limitations of AI and make it practical. With XAI, it is possible to provide a basis for judgment on the final outcome of the AI. In this paper, we conducted malware group classification using XGBoost and Random Forest, and interpreted the results through SHAP. Both classification models showed a high classification accuracy of about 99%, and when comparing the top 20 API features derived through XAI with the main APIs of malware, it was possible to interpret and understand more than a certain level. In the future, based on this, a direct AI reliability improvement study will be conducted."

For this reason, there is a high possibility of complaints regarding odors if odors occur in pigsties near residential properties, and the number of such complaints is also increasing. In addition, odors emanating from pigsties around military installations can cause physical and psychological harm, not only to the soldiers living in these type of facilities but also to the families belonging to military personnel living there as well. Because the concentration of odors varies due to diverse factors such as temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, and interaction between causative materials, predicting odors based on only one factor is not proper or appropriate. Therefore, in this work, we sought to construct models that are based on several regression techniques of machine learning using data collected in field. And we selected and utilized the model that has the highest-accuracy in order to notify and warn residents of odors in advance. In this work, 3672 data items were used to train and test the model. The several machine learning algorithms to build the models are polynomial regression, ridge regression, K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN Regression), and random forest. Comparing the performance of models based on each algorithm, the study found that KNN Regression was the most suitable model, and the result obtained from KNN regression was significant."

Node2vec is the method that improves the limit of the structural equivalence representation of the network, which is known to be relatively weak compared to the existing link prediction method based on the number of common neighbors of the network. Therefore, the method is known to show excellent performance in both community detection and structural equivalence of the network. The vector value obtained by embedding the network in this way operates under the condition of a constant length from an arbitrarily designated starting point node. Therefore, it has the advantage that it is easy to apply the sequence of nodes as an input value to the model for downstream tasks such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Based on these features of the Node2vec graph embedding method, this study applied the above method to the international trade information of the Korean food and beverage industry. Through this, we intend to contribute to creating the effect of extensive margin diversification in Korea in the global value chain relationship of the industry. The optimal predictive model derived from the results of this study recorded a precision of 0.95 and a recall of 0.79, and an F1 score of 0.86, showing excellent performance. This performance was shown to be superior to that of the binary classifier based on Logistic Regression set as the baseline model. In the baseline model, a precision of 0.95 and a recall of 0.73 were recorded, and an F1 score of 0.83 was recorded. In addition, the light GBM-based optimal prediction model derived from this study showed superior performance than the link prediction model of previous studies, which is set as a benchmarking model in this study. The predictive model of the previous study recorded only a recall rate of 0.75, but the proposed model of this study showed better performance which recall rate is 0.79. The difference in the performance of the prediction results between benchmarking model and this study model is due to the model learning strategy. In this study, groups were classified by the trade value scale, and prediction models were trained differently for these groups. Specific methods are (1) a method of randomly masking and learning a model for all trades without setting specific conditions for trade value, (2) arbitrarily masking a part of the trades with an average trade value or higher and using the model method, and (3) a method of arbitrarily masking some of the trades with the top 25% or higher trade value and learning the model. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the performance of the model trained by randomly masking some of the trades with the above-average trade value in this method was the best and appeared stably. It was found that most of the results of potential export candidates for Korea derived through the above model appeared appropriate through additional investigation. Combining the above, this study could suggest the practical utility of the link prediction method applying Node2vec and Light GBM. In addition, useful implications could be derived for weight update strategies that can perform better link prediction while training the model. On the other hand, this study also has policy utility because it is applied to trade transactions that have not been performed much in the research related to link prediction based on graph embedding. The results of this study support a rapid response to changes in the global value chain such as the recent US-China trade conflict or Japans export regulations, and I think that it has sufficient usefulness as a tool for policy decision-making."

In recent years, our group investigated the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and free-PSA predictive role for prostate cancer (PCa), using the classical binary logistic regression (LR) modeling. In this research, we approached the same clinical problem by several different ML algorithms, to evaluate their performances and feasibility in a real-world evidence PCa detection trial.Materials and Methods: The occurrence of a positive biopsy has been studied in a large cohort of 1,246 Italian men undergoing first or repeat biopsy. Seven supervised ML algorithms were selected to build biomarkers-based predictive models: generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, eXtreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost), distributed random forest/extremely randomized forest, multilayer artificial Deep Neural Network, naïve Bayes classifier, and an automatic ML ensemble function.Results: All the ML models showed better performances in terms of area under curve (AUC) and accuracy, when compared to LR model. Among them, an XGBoost model tuned by the autoML function reached the best metrics (AUC, 0.830), well overtaking LR results (AUC, 0.738). In the variable importance ranking coming from this XGBoost model (accuracy, 0.824), the PCA3 score importance was 3-fold and 4-fold larger, when compared to that of free-PSA and PSA, respectively.Conclusions: The ML approach proved to be feasible and able to achieve good predictive performances with reproducible results: it may thus be recommended, when applied to PCa prediction based on biomarkers fluctuations."
Practical prediction model of the clinical response to programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors in advanced gastric cancer,2021,,,"The identification of predictive biomarkers or models is necessary for the selection of patients who might benefit the most from immunotherapy. Seven histological features (signet ring cell [SRC], fibrous stroma, myxoid stroma, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TILs], necrosis, tertiary lymphoid follicles, and ulceration) detected in surgically resected tissues ( N = 44) were used to train a model. The presence of SRC became an optimal decision parameter for pathology alone (AUC = 0.78). Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for the prediction of genomic markers showed that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 11 ( CXCL11 ) was high in responders ( P < 0.001). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to verify its potential as a biomarker. IHC revealed that the expression of CXCL11 was associated with responsiveness ( P = 0.003). The response prediction model was trained by integrating the results of the analysis of pathological factors and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). When trained with the C5.0 decision tree model, the categorical level of the expression of CXCL11 , a single variable, was shown to be the best model (AUC = 0.812). The AUC of the model trained with the random forest was 0.944. Survival analysis revealed that the C5.0-trained model (log-rank P = 0.01 for progression-free survival [PFS]; log-rank P = 0.012 for overall survival [OS]) and the random forest-trained model (log-rank P < 0.001 for PFS; log-rank P = 0.001 for OS) predicted prognosis more accurately than the PD-L1 test (log-rank P = 0.031 for PFS; log-rank P = 0.107 for OS)."

To increase confidence in vaccination, the active monitoring of vaccine adverse events is important. For effective active surveillance, we developed and verified a machine learning-based active surveillance system using national claim data.Methods: We used two databases, one from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, which contains flu vaccination records for the elderly, and another from the National Health Insurance Service, which contains the claim data of vaccinated people. We developed a casecrossover design based machine learning model to predict the health outcome of interest events (anaphylaxis and agranulocytosis) using a random forest. Feature importance values were evaluated to determine candidate associations with each outcome. We investigated the relationship of the features to each event via a literature review, comparison with the Side Effect Resource, and using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation method.Results: The trained model predicted each health outcome of interest with a high accuracy (approximately 70%). We found literature supporting our results, and most of the important drug-related features were listed in the Side Effect Resource database as inducing the health outcome of interest. For anaphylaxis, flu vaccination ranked high in our feature importance analysis and had a positive association in Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation analysis. Although the feature importance of vaccination was lower for agranulocytosis, it also had a positive relationship in the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation analysis.Conclusion: We developed a machine learning-based active surveillance system for detecting possible factors that can induce adverse events using health claim and vaccination databases.The results of the study demonstrated a potentially useful application of two linked national health record databases. Our model can contribute to the establishment of a system for conducting active surveillance on vaccination."

A spectral dataset was built by acquiring infrared spectra in the 4000-400 cm<SUP>−1</SUP> region from six species of the Cannabaceae family. Random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network models were established for wood identification. In addition, the mean decrease impurity-based feature importance was produced from the random forest model. Because the spectral characteristics of the six species were very similar, the identification accuracies of the models trained with the original infrared spectra were low as 0.533-0.733. Data preprocessing using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm resulted in improved accuracy to 0.800-0.867. Random forest suggested that the feature importance of the 1800-700 cm<SUP>−1</SUP> region was relatively high.

The pretreatment data were divided into train and test data with the ratio of 7:3. We used random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) among machine learning. RF and ANN were tested by both random split and time series data, while CNN and GRU conducted the experiment using only time series data. Performance evaluation indicators such as square of the correlation coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to compare the optimal results for the models.Results and Discussion:Based on the RF variable importance results and references, water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, PO4-P, NH4-N, total phosphorus, suspended solids, and NO3-N were used as input factors. Both RF and ANN performed better with time series data than random split. The model performance was good in order of RF > CNN > GRU > ANN.Conclusions:The eight input factors (water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, PO4-P, NH4-N, total phosphorus, suspended solids, and NO3-N) were selected for machine learning models to predict DO in Gyeongan Stream. The best model for DO prediction was the RF model with time series data. Therefore, we suggest that the RF with the eight input factors could be used to predict the DO in streams."

These models were assessed with the corresponding independent models (i.e., gated recurrent unit, generalized regression neural networks, and random forests). Diverse water quality and quantity indicators were implemented for developing independent and two-stage hybrid models based on several input combinations (i.e., Divisions 1-5). The addressed models were evaluated using three statistical indices including the root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and correlation coefficient (CC).

KSURE(Korea Trade Insurance Corporation) is a major public institution for financial policy in Korea, and thus the company is strongly committed to backing export companies with various systems. Nevertheless, there are still fewer cases of realized business model based on big-data analyses.  In this situation, this paper aims to develop a new business model which can be applied to an ex-ante prediction for the likelihood of the insurance accident of credit guarantee. We utilize internal data from KSURE which supports export companies in Korea and apply machine learning models. Then, we conduct performance comparison among the predictive models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN(Deep Neural Network).  For decades, many researchers have tried to find better models which can help to predict bankruptcy since the ex-ante prediction is crucial for corporate managers, investors, creditors, and other stakeholders. The development of the prediction for financial distress or bankruptcy was originated from Smith(1930), Fitzpatrick(1932), or Merwin(1942). One of the most famous models is the Altmans Z-score model(Altman, 1968) which was based on the multiple discriminant analysis. This model is widely used in both research and practice by this time. The author suggests the score model that utilizes five key financial ratios to predict the probability of bankruptcy in the next two years. Ohlson(1980) introduces logit model to complement some limitations of previous models. Furthermore, Elmer and Borowski(1988) develop and examine a rule-based, automated system which conducts the financial analysis of savings and loans.  Since the 1980s, researchers in Korea have started to examine analyses on the prediction of financial distress or bankruptcy. Kim(1987) analyzes financial ratios and develops the prediction model. Also, Han et al.(1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2005, 2006) construct the prediction model using various techniques including artificial neural network. Yang(1996) introduces multiple discriminant analysis and logit model. Besides, Kim and Kim(2001) utilize artificial neural network techniques for ex-ante prediction of insolvent enterprises. After that, many scholars have been trying to predict financial distress or bankruptcy more precisely based on diverse models such as Random Forest or SVM. One major distinction of our research from the previous research is that we focus on examining the predicted probability of default for each sample case, not only on investigating the classification accuracy of each model for the entire sample.  Most predictive models in this paper show that the level of the accuracy of classification is about 70% based on the entire sample. To be specific, LightGBM model shows the highest accuracy of 71.1% and Logit model indicates the lowest accuracy of 69%. However, we confirm that there are open to multiple interpretations. In the context of the business, we have to put more emphasis on efforts to minimize type 2 error which causes more harmful operating losses for the guaranty company. Thus, we also compare the classification accuracy by splitting predicted probability of the default into ten equal intervals.  When we examine the classification accuracy for each interval, Logit model has the highest accuracy of 100% for 0~10% of the predicted probability of the default, however, Logit model has a relatively lower accuracy of 61.5% for 90~100% of the predicted probability of the default. On the other hand, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN indicate more desirable results since they indicate a higher level of accuracy for both 0~10% and 90~100% of the predicted probability of the default but have a lower level of accur"

However, regarding the domestic crime prediction research using machine learning, the current related studies are insufficient because disclosure of crime data is restricted and most of these studies predicted crimes by using a wide range of analysis units or by focusing on a few variables. To effectively distribute police power through practical crime prediction, it is necessary to predict the time and place of the crime. Therefore, in this study, we train machine learning models with 9,413 instances of actual theft crime data having temporal-spatial elements such as crime time and date, buildings, land-use, and CCTV. Thereby, we intend to provide a basis for future research and assist crime prevention activities practically by comparing the results of the prediction models. In this study, we divided the target land into 100 m square grids by using GIS and then inserted crime and temporal-spatial related variables. Subsequently, we trained the typical machine learning models such as random forest, decision trees, SVC, and K-NN, conducted crime prediction, and compared the results of the models. In the case of crime data, generally, an excessive amount of unbalanced data is present for the places where crimes did not occur compared to places where crimes occurred. Unbalanced data can result in noise and cause inaccurate predictions-these issues must be addressed. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a resampling method as an alternative to solve data imbalances and provide crime prediction with improved accuracy. The results of the comparison of the prediction performance of the models showed that the F1 score of the random forest model using the SMOTE method was high. This could be because the data loss of the SMOTE method is less than that of the under-sampling method and the random forest as an ensemble type model has an advantage in predicting data with various variables. We compared the influence of each variable by employing the feature importance function. Overall, the temporal-related variables showed high influence-among them, crimes occurred within one month showed the highest influence. Among the physical environment-related variables, first neighborhood living facility, retail store, and detached house were found to have high influence."

The general approach to predictive models of machine learning has no significant difference from statistics or data mining, but its purpose is not interpretation of the model, but focuses on prediction, such as accuracy, so the most suitable method appears differently for each data. In order to overcome these shortcomings, each prediction model tries to interpret the model through function selection or contribution.

This study was aimed to develop a data-driven inflow water temperature prediction model for Daecheong Reservoir (DR), and to predict future inflow water temperature and the stratification structure of DR considering future climate scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). The random forest (RF)regression model (NSE 0.97, RMSE 1.86°C, MAPE 9.45%) developed to predict the inflow temperature of DR adequately reproduced the statistics and variability of the observed water temperature. Future meteorological data for each RCP scenario predicted by the regional climate model (HadGEM3-RA) was input into RF model to predict the inflow water temperature, and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (AEM3D) was used to predict the change in the future (2018~2037, 2038~2057, 2058~2077, 2078~2097) stratification structure of DR due to climate change. As a result, the rates of increase in air temperature and inflow water temperature was 0.14~0.48°C/10year and 0.21~0.41°C/10year,respectively. As a result of seasonal analysis, in all scenarios except spring and winter in the RCP 2.6, the increase in inflow water temperature was statistically significant, and the increase rate was higher as the carbon reduction effort was weaker. The increase rate of the surface water temperature of the reservoir was in the range of 0.04~0.38°C/10year, and the stratification period was gradually increased in all scenarios. In particular, when the RCP 8.5 scenario is applied, the number of stratification days is expected to increase by about 24 days. These results were consistent with the results of previous studies that climate change strengthens the stratification intensity of lakes and reservoirs and prolonged the stratification period, and suggested that prolonged water temperature stratification could cause changes in the aquatic ecosystem, such as spatial expansion of the low-oxygen layer, an increase in sediment nutrient release, and changed in the dominant species of algae in the water body."

"Household, personal, and financial determinants of surrender in Korean health insurance",2021,"['surrender', 'lapse rate', 'determinants', 'lasso regularized regression', 'panel survey data', 'random forest missing value imputation']",,"In insurance, the surrender rate is an important variable that threatens the sustainability of insurers and determines the profitability of the contract. Unlike other actuarial assumptions that determine the cash flow of an insurance contract, however, it is characterized by endogenous variables such as people's economic, social, and subjective decisions. Therefore, a microscopic approach is required to identify and analyze the factors that determine the lapse rate. Specifically, micro-level characteristics including the individual, demographic, microeconomic, and household characteristics of policyholders are necessary for the analysis. In this study, we select panel survey data of Korean Retirement Income Study (KReIS) with many diverse dimensions to determine which variables have a decisive effect on the lapse and apply the lasso regularized regression model to analyze it empirically. As the data contain many missing values, they are imputed using the random forest method. Among the household variables, we find that the non-existence of old dependents, the existence of young dependents, and employed family members increase the surrender rate. Among the individual variables, divorce, non-urban residential areas, apartment type of housing, non-ownership of homes, and bad relationship with siblings increase the lapse rate. Finally, among the financial variables, low income, low expenditure, the existence of children that incur child care expenditure, not expecting to bequest from spouse, not holding public health insurance, and expecting to benefit from a retirement pension increase the lapse rate. Some of these findings are consistent with those in the literature."

This study presents the scientific basis for a big data analysis of institutional improvements in fire safety and responses by evaluating the correlation and importance of factors that affect property damage based on whether sprinkler systems are used in buildings to fight structure fires. Independent variables used in property damage analysis utilize building information and the time and distance affecting site access by mobilized equipment and personnel from the Korean National Fire Agency. In the analysis process, independent variables for machine learning were selected by analyzing significance probability and the Pearson correlation between property damage and fire factors. Using random forest, the importance of factors affecting property damage is derived based on whether there was a sprinkler system inside the building or not. In the analysis results, the main factors influencing property damage included mobilized personnel, mobilized equipment, initial time needed to extinguish the fire, the total fire suppression time, etc. If a sprinkler system was installed, the relative importance of the initial fire exhaustion time and the total fire suppression time was calculated to be 34.2% and 3.9% higher, compared to not having a sprinkler system installed. These results show that the use of such fire extinguishing equipment can minimize property damage, so it confirms the need for policy system improvement that can strengthen the installation and operation of fire extinguishing equipment."

Therefore, this study conducted a comparative experiment of spatial interpolation of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations based on two linear-regression methods (i.e., multi linear regression (MLR), and regression kriging (RK)), and two machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR)) for the year of 2020. Four approaches were compared using leave-one-out-cross validation (LOOCV). The daily LOOCV results showed that MLR, RK, and SVR produced the average daily index of agreement (IOA) of 0.57, which was higher than that of RF (0.50). The average daily normalized root mean square error of RK was 0.9483%, which was slightly lower than those of the other models. MLR, RK and SVR showed similar seasonal distribution patterns, and the dynamic range of the resultant NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from these three models was similar while that from RF was relatively small. The multivariate linear regression approaches are expected to be a promising method for spatial interpolation of ground-level NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and other parameters in urban areas."

Thus, local radiant heating was proposed as a heating strategy to reduce electric energy consumption while providing reasonable thermal comfort. In this work, we developed a personalized overall thermal sensation (OS) model using machine learning to evaluate the thermopsychological effect of local radiant heating and simulate the OS of occupants in EVs. Data were obtained from a real EV that went through a cold environmental chamber and were evaluated using random forest algorithm. By considering individual thermal preferences of occupants, we predicted the OS for each subject with higher accuracy by a factor of 2.6 compared with the prediction performed using the weighted average method. Total energy consumption was reduced by approximately 10 % in the EV equipped with local infrared radiant warmers while providing OS that was comparable with that of the HVAC system."

The partial discharge data are extracted from the high-dimensional input space. It is very likely for the data extracted in a very high-dimensional input space to have redundant information and to cause the overfitting problem. In order to the above problems caused by the high-dimensional input space, we have to select the important features among the whole input features. In order to select several features, the tree structure of random forest and the evaluation criterion called Information Gain are used. The features selected by using the proposed feature selection technique are used as the inputs of radial basis function neural networks classifier. In addition, Fuzzy C-Means Clustering is used to determine the center points of the radial basis functions.

Accurate forecasts of crop production can improve the effectiveness of such measures. However, it is challenging to obtain accurate estimates of crop productivity for onions because they are mainly grown on the open fields. The objective of this study was to perform the empirical analysis of the relationship between factors for crop growth and meteorological conditions, which can support the development of models to predict crop growth and production. The growth survey data were collected from open fields. The survey data included the weight of above ground organs as well as that of the bulbs. The estimates of meteorological data were also compiled for the given fields. Correlation analysis between these factors was performed. The random forest was also used to compare the importance of the meteorological factors by the growth stage. Our results indicated that insolation in early March had a positive effect on the growth of the above-ground. There was a negative correlation between precipitation and the growth of the above-ground at the end of March although it has been suggested that drought can deter the growth of onion. The negative effects of precipitation and daylight hours on the growth of the above-ground and under-ground were significant during the harvest period. These meteorological factors identified by growth stage can be used to develop models for onion growth and production forecast."

Next, correlation analysis was performed to remove redundant variables, and random forest identified important factors that caused the more serious condition of damage to the deck. A total of 32 variables were finally used to develop Deep Neural Networks to predict different types of deck damage. The developed model successfully predicted the occurrences of seven different types of damage to bridge decks, that is, linear cracking, map cracking, scaling, breakage, leakage, efflorescence, and corrosion of exposed rebar, with the average weighted F1 score of 91%. Environmental effects on prediction were also determined; for example, traffic, temperature, and precipitation increased the F1 score of linear cracking by 4%.

However, as algae are living organisms, it is difficult to predict according to physical dynamics, and not easy to consider the effects of numerous factors such as weather, hydraulic, hydrology, and water quality. Therefore, a lot of researches on algal bloom prediction using machine learning have been recently conducted. In this study, the characteristic importance of water quality factors affecting the occurrence of Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) were analyzed using the random forest (RF) model for Bohyeonsan Dam and Yeongcheon Dam located in Yeongcheon-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do and also predicted the occurrence of harmful blue-green algae using the machine learning and deep learning models and evaluated their accuracy. The water temperature and total nitrogen (T-N) were found to be high in common, and the occurrence prediction of CyanoHABs using artificial neural network (ANN) also predicted the actual values closely, confirming that it can be used for the reservoirs that require the prediction of harmful cyanobacteria for algal management in the future."

Method: This study used the 1st year (N=2,590) and 2nd year (N=2,438) data of first year middle school student panels obtained from the Korea Children & Youth Panel Survey 2018. Moreover, behavioral and emotional problems of adolescents were confirmed through the latent profile analysis. To distinguish the emotional-and-behavioral-risk group and the near-risk group, this study constructed a machine learning model applying logistic regression analysis and random forest algorithm. Hence, the first year data were utilized as the training data and the second year the test data, thus inputting 73 predictive factors. Results: Four latent groups were identified from both waves: the stable, the attention-problems-and-aggression, the near-risk, and the at-risk. Machine learning algorithms for both models indicated a decent performance, with AUCs ranging from 84.2% to 89.4%. Additionally, negative peer relationship and academic helplessness were found the most important in predicting the near- and the at-risk groups, and academic helplessness for only the at-risk group. Smartphone dependency, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and perceived negative parenting attitude were also important variables. Conclusions: Person-centered approaches, such as latent profile analysis, as well as machine learning algorithms in developmental studies can serve as evidence for identifying and predicting adolescent groups at risk and providing customized intervention.

To reduce such adverse impacts, it is necessary to have spatially continuous fog risk information. In this work, tree-based machine-learning models were developed in order to quantify fog risks with routine meteorological observations alone. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting (LGB), and Random Forests (RF) were chosen for the regional fog models using operational weather and visibility observations within the Jeollabuk-do province. Results showed that RF seemed to show the most robust performance to categorize between fog and non-fog situations during the training and evaluation period of 2017-2019. While the LGB performed better than in predicting fog occurrences than the others, its false alarm ratio was the highest (0.695) among the three models. The predictability of the three models considerably declined when applying them for an independent period of 2020, potentially due to the distinctively enhanced air quality in the year under the global lockdown. Nonetheless, even in 2020, the three models were all able to produce fog risk information consistent with the spatial variation of observed fog occurrences. This work suggests that the tree-based machine learning models could be used as tools to find locations with relatively high fog risks."

To this end, the open commercial district data of ‘Our Village Shop Commercial Area Analysis Service’ operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government was utilized. First, as a result of analyzing the predictive performance of business closure, the random forest model was the highest for the service industry and the support vector machine model was the highest for the catering industry. Subsequently, the factors that have the most influencing on the business closure prediction model were the surviving population by building unit, average operating period, and rent in the case of the service industry, and rent, the number of households, and the surviving population by building in the catering business. Through this, new self-employed persons can grasp the characteristics of the commercial district they want to enter and build a survival strategy appropriate for them, and local governments and governments can use them as indicators of support policies such as sales strategy consulting and capacity building for existing self-employed persons.

Thus, this study proposes machine learning models to automatically classify defect complaint text-data into one of the sub categories of ‘finishing work’ (i.e., one of the defect repair tasks). In the proposed models, we employed two word representation methods (Bag-of-words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)) and two machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest). In particular, we conducted both binary- and multi- classification tasks to classify 9 sub categories of finishing work: home appliance installation work, paperwork, painting work, plastering work, interior masonry work, plaster finishing work, indoor furniture installation work, kitchen facility installation work, and tiling work. The machine learning classifiers using the TF-IDF representation method and Random Forest classification achieved more than 90% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We shed light on the possibility of constructing automated defect classification systems based on the proposed machine learning models."
Machine Learning Approaches to Identify Factors Associated with Women's Vasomotor Symptoms Using General Hospital Data,2021,"['Vasomotor Symptoms', 'Hot Flashes', 'Menopause Age', 'Thyroid Stimulating Hormone', 'Monocyte', 'Cancer Antigen']",,"Background: To analyze the factors associated with women's vasomotor symptoms (VMS) using machine learning.Methods: Data on 3,298 women, aged 40–80 years, who attended their general health check-up from January 2010 to December 2012 were obtained from Korea University Anam Hospital in Seoul, Korea. Five machine learning methods were applied and compared for the prediction of VMS, measured by the Menopause Rating Scale. Variable importance, the effect of a variable on model performance, was used for identifying the major factors associated with VMS.Results: In terms of the mean squared error, the random forest (0.9326) was much better than linear regression (12.4856) and artificial neural networks with one, two, and three hidden layers (1.5576, 1.5184, and 1.5833, respectively). Based on the variable importance from the random forest, the most important factors associated with VMS were age, menopause age, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and monocyte, triglyceride, gamma glutamyl transferase, blood urea nitrogen, cancer antigen 19-9, C-reactive protein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Indeed, the following variables were ranked within the top 20 in terms of variable importance: cancer antigen 125, total cholesterol, insulin, free thyroxine, forced vital capacity, alanine aminotransferase, forced expired volume in 1 second, height, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, and carcinoembryonic antigen.Conclusion: Machine learning provides an invaluable decision support system for the prediction of VMS. For managing VMS, comprehensive consideration is needed regarding thyroid function, lipid profile, liver function, inflammation markers, insulin resistance, monocyte count, cancer antigens, and lung function."

We adopt a signal approach to detect the housing market risk and establish the early warning system using classification methods. Considering the moment when the housing market falls into recession as a warning signal, we set the signal as the price which is more than the sum of the average and standard deviation of upcoming prices. The detected signals are consistent with empirical observations in the Korean housing market. We select the best performing function among classification models for machine learning which predicts a warning signal. As a result of an intercomparison of models including the logistic regression, the support vector machine, the random forest and the artificial neural network with the use of inputs such as housing price indices, macroeconomic variables and other housing market variables, we find that the random forest demonstrates the highest prediction performance. Our early warning system yields policy implications in terms of relevant detection of price fluctuations in the housing market."

For good training, units require proper organization support agents, but they have difficulties due to a lack of unit members. For that reason, the units forecast the monthly attendance rate of reserve forces (using the x-1 year""s result) to organize support agents and unit schedule. On the other hand, the existing planning method can have more errors compared to the actual result of the attendance rate. This problem has a negative effect on the training performance. Therefore, it requires more accurate forecast models to reduce attendance rate errors. This paper proposes an attendance rate forecast model using data mining. To verify the proposed data mining based model, the existing planning method was compared with the proposed model using real data. The results showed that the proposed model outperforms the existing planning method."

The government expected that housing stability would be achieved by introducing the price ceiling system, but there was a constant controversy over the effect of it. Some experts argued that the price ceiling system does not affect existing housing prices, but rather reduces housing supply, which increases price in the long run. In this study, we intend to analyze the impact of the price ceiling system on housing market forecast by predicting housing market based on the presence or absence of the price ceiling system and comparing the accuracy. Several previous research have studied the factors affecting housing price, but this only identified the correlation, and there was insufficient of research on housing price prediction according to actual policy. To overcome such statistical limitations, this paper predicts housing price using machine learning that can be interpreted with high accuracy even if input variables are incomplete, wide, or irregular. As a result of analysis, the difference between RMSE(Root Mean Error), error rate mean, and error rate standard deviation was insignificant even if the price ceiling system was applied or not. This means that the housing market is more affected by other factors than the price ceiling system."

Clearer and more reliable models need to be developed on an ongoing basis, considering the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence algorithms, hardware and developing platforms, and data.

The investigated machine learning models were found to estimate pile load capacities with scores in terms of the coefficient of determinant over 0.5. The most appropriate ensemble models for the pile load estimation were the gradient boosting and XB boosting models.

Overall model estimates were accurated at 81% and also presented high accuracy for each model choice. To interpret users’ behaviors and preferences, variable importance (VI), variable contribution, and interactive partial dependence were estimated.

The subject of this study is 189 project districts(121 promoted districts, 68 cancelled districts). Both 121 promoted districts and 68 cancelled districts were analyzed by Decision Tree Analysis. The first separation of the release zone influencing factors was made by the Development Actors. In other words, the most important independent variable for determining the release zone influence factor was shown to be the presence or absence of propulsion actors. Of the 89 districts without propellers, 41 were lifted and 48 were promoted, and 9 out of 100 districts with propellers were lifted and 91 were promoted. The second separation of the impact factors on the zone was then made by Land Owners, and the probability of cancellation increased if the number of landowners was less than 468 and 37 out of 62 were removed. On the other hand, four out of 27 districts with more than 468 landowners were lifted and 23 districts were promoted. The third separation was made by the Average Land Assessment, and 35 zones were lifted below the standard of KRW 269.64 million/m² approximately KRW 8.91 million per pyeong, and two zones were lifted at higher official prices.

The Korea Forest Service attempted to quantify the soil creep susceptible areas using a discriminant value table to prevent or mitigate casualties and/or property damages in advance. With the advent of advanced computer technologies, machine learning-based classification models have been employed for managing mountainous disasters, such as landslides and debris flows. This study aims to quantify the soil creep susceptibility using several classifiers, namely the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. To develop the classification models, we downscaled 292 data from 4,618 field survey data. About 70% of the selected data were used for training, with the remaining 30% used for model testing. The developed models have the classification accuracy of 0.727 for k-NN, 0.750 for NB, 0.807 for RF, and 0.750 for SVM against test datasets representing 30% of the total data. Furthermore, we estimated Cohen's Kappa index as 0.534, 0.580, 0.673, and 0.585, with AUC values of 0.872, 0.912, 0.943, and 0.834, respectively.

베이지안 최적화를 통한 저서성 대형무척추동물 종분포모델 개발,2021,,,"This study explored the usefulness and implications of the Bayesian hyperparameter optimization in developing species distribution models (SDMs). A variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosted regression tree (BRT), XGBoost (XGB), and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) were used for predicting the occurrence of four benthic macroinvertebrate species. The Bayesian optimization method successfully tuned model hyperparameters, with all ML models resulting an area under the curve (AUC) > 0.7. Also, hyperparameter search ranges that generally clustered around the optimal values suggest the efficiency of the Bayesian optimization in finding optimal sets of hyperparameters. Tree based ensemble algorithms (BRT, RF, and XGB) tended to show higher performances than SVM and MLP. Important hyperparameters and optimal values differed by species and ML model, indicating the necessity of hyperparameter tuning for improving individual model performances. The optimization results demonstrate that for all macroinvertebrate species SVM and RF required fewer numbers of trials until obtaining optimal hyperparameter sets, leading to reduced computational cost compared to other ML algorithms. The results of this study suggest that the Bayesian optimization is an efficient method for hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms."

Therefore, many studies have been conducted to improve predictions by using explanatory variables such as precipitation, temperature, sunshine duration, and air volume as input data. The purpose of this study is to devise a method for predicting drought using the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI), which represents a complex and difficult time series drought index using climate data for weather phenomena. The Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index is a method of calculating the cumulative precipitation by excluding the cumulative evaporation amount from the cumulative precipitation using precipitation and evapotranspiration data, and the evaporation amount is calculated using the monthly heat index method. The Meteorological Agency evaluated meteorological drought using SPI6, which is a 6-month cumulative precipitation standard, and applied it to machine learning based on monthly data and daily data SPEI6 in this study. As a result, ANN monthly data R2 was 0.488 in Andong and 0.533 in Mungyeong, Gumi 0.594, SVR 0.452, 0.496, 0.564, RF 0.355, 0.467, 0.524, and the daily data are ANN 0.923, 0.919, 0.915, SVR 0.925, 0.923, 0.896, RF 0.915, 0.915, 0.797, and the daily data SPEI at all points.

Ensemble machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) are some of the most popular machine learning algorithms used for water environmental management, along with deep learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks. In this study GBDT, an ensemble machine learning algorithm, and gated recurrent unit (GRU), a recurrent neural networks algorithm, are used for model development to predict turbidity in a river. The observation frequencies of input data used for the model were 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 120 and 168 h.

Both models show similar prediction accuracy with RSR of 0.682 for GRU and 0.683 for GBDT. The GRU shows better prediction accuracy when the observation frequency is relatively short (i.e., 2, 4, and 8 h) where GBDT shows better prediction accuracy when the observation frequency is relatively long (i.e. 48, 120, 160 h).

We carried out non-multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and random forest analysis (RF) for comparing the pattern of phytoplankton distribution and the relationship between phytoplankton distribution and environmental variables. Similarity Percentage (SIMPER) and Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) were performed to figure out the similarity of phytoplankton community at each site of three lakes. From NMDS, Phytoplankton community distribution differed between Yeongsan and Gumho lakes, and the factors influencing the distribution of phytoplankton communities across the three lakes were water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen (T-N), nitrate-N (NO3-N), and conductivity. NO3-N was a key factor influencing phytoplankton community structure in the three lakes based on RF. A total of 24 species were identified as indicator species in the three lakes studied, with the highest species numbers observed in Yeongsan Lake (13) and the lowest observed in Yeongam Lake (2). According to SIMPER and ANOSIM results, the phytoplankton community in Yeongsan and Yeongam lakes were similar, and they differed from those in Gumho Lake. In addition, the phytoplankton community structure varied across the study sites in the three lakes, indicating that water channels across the lakes a minor influence phytoplankton community distribution."
초고속주행 시 횡방향 주행안전성에 영향을 미치는 설계요소 평가 연구,2021,"['elderly driver', 'high-speed condition', 'lateral safety', 'superhighway']",,"PURPOSES : The purpose of this study is to evaluate the road design elements affecting the lateral driving safety under high-speed driving conditions with a speed limit of 140 km/h and to derive useful implications to design of safer roads. METHODS : A full-scale driving simulator was used to evaluate the various design scenarios. Different regression techniques and a random forest method were adopted to conduct comprehensive comparisons among the simulation scenarios. The relationships between the safety indicators, including the frequency of the lane departures and the standard deviation of the lateral acceleration, and the design elements were explored in terms of lateral driving safety. RESULTS : The length of the combined alignment was found to be a significant factor affecting the lateral driving safety based on the analysis of the frequency of lane departures. Regarding the standard deviation of the lateral acceleration, it was identified that the length of the horizontal curve, the length of the bridge, and the right-side superelevation must be considered significant factors associated with driving safety while designing the road under high-speed driving conditions. CONCLUSIONS : Based on the findings of this study, a set of recommendations for designing roads was proposed. For example, the proper length of the combined alignment and the horizontal curve should be determined to prevent crashes due to hazardous lateral driving events because the installation of sufficient superelevation in the bridge section would be limited under high-speed driving conditions. In addition, applying a larger horizontal curve radius with longitudinal grooving is a promising approach to tackle risky driving conditions."
Metabolic Subtyping of Adrenal Tumors: Prospective Multi-Center Cohort Study in Korea,2021,"['Steroid metabolism', 'Supervised machine learning', 'Adrenal neoplasms', 'Cushing syndrome', 'Primary hyperaldosteronism']",,"Background: Conventional diagnostic approaches for adrenal tumors require multi-step processes, including imaging studies anddynamic hormone tests. Therefore, this study aimed to discriminate adrenal tumors from a single blood sample based on the combination of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and machine learning algorithms in serum profiling of adrenal steroids.Methods: The LC-MS-based steroid profiling was applied to serum samples obtained from patients with nonfunctioning adenoma(NFA, n=73), Cushing’s syndrome (CS, n=30), and primary aldosteronism (PA, n=40) in a prospective multicenter study of adrenaldisease. The decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) were performed to categorize the subtypes of adrenal tumors.Results: The CS group showed higher serum levels of 11-deoxycortisol than the NFA group, and increased levels of tetrahydrocortisone (THE), 20α-dihydrocortisol, and 6β-hydroxycortisol were found in the PA group. However, the CS group showed lower levelsof dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate derivative (DHEA-S) than both the NFA and PA groups. Patients with PA expressed higher serum 18-hydroxycortisol and DHEA but lower THE than NFA patients. The balanced accuracies of DT, RF, andXGBoost for classifying each type were 78%, 96%, and 97%, respectively. In receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis forCS, XGBoost, and RF showed a significantly greater diagnostic power than the DT. However, in ROC analysis for PA, only RF exhibited better diagnostic performance than DT.Conclusion: The combination of LC-MS-based steroid profiling with machine learning algorithms could be a promising one-stepdiagnostic approach for the classification of adrenal tumor subtypes."

In particular, we aimed to verify the usefulness of machine learning algorithms as a tool to predict future flood risks. Through this analysis, we sought to provide fundamental data for preparing plans to improve flood risk predictions and establishing climate change adaptation measures. To this end, we used three machine learning algorithms (naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest) to predict flood risks in certain areas of Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk Province, South Korea, where heavy rain occur frequently, and assessed future flood risk for each regional climate model and climate change scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 4.5 and 8.5). RF (AUC: 0.616), among all machine learning algorithms tested, achieved the best flood risk predictive performance. Furthermore, for each climate change scenario, the models confirmed a gradual increase in flood risk over time, even when the uncertainty of the future is considered. In particular, if the greenhouse gas mitigation policy fails (RCP8.5), the flood risk will increase significantly."

All the prediction metrics were higher in the ensemble models, except NPVs in both the internal and the external validation datasets.Conclusion: We established an ensemble prediction model for prediction of unfavorable 1-year neurological outcomes in OHCA survivors using four machine learning methods. The prediction performance of the ensemble model was higher than the multivariable logistic regression model, while its performance was slightly decreased in the external validation dataset."

Sarcopenia, in which muscle mass decrease with aging, is associated with various diseases, the risk of falling, and the deterioration of quality of life. Obesity and sarcopenia also have a synergy effect on the disease of the older adults. Objects: This study examined the risk factors for sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and sarcope-nia without obesity and developed prediction models. Methods: This machine-learning study used the 2008–2011 Korea National Health and Nu-trition Examination Surveys in the analysis. After data curation, 5,563 older participants were selected, of whom 1,169 had sarcopenia, 538 had sarcopenic obesity, and 631 had sarco-penia without obesity; the remaining 4,394 were normal. Decision tree and random forest models were used to identify risk factors. Results: The risk factors for sarcopenia chosen by both methods were body mass index (BMI) and duration of moderate physical activity; those for sarcopenic obesity were sex, BMI, and duration of moderate physical activity; and those for sarcopenia without obesity were BMI and sex. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of all prediction models exceeded 0.75. BMI could predict sarcopenia-related disease. Conclusion: Risk factors for sarcopenia-related diseases should be identified and programs for sarcopenia-related disease prevention should be developed. Data-mining research using population data should be conducted to enhance the effectiveness of early treatment for people with sarcopenia-related diseases through predictive models."
Tree-Based Ensemble Methods: Predicting Asphalt Mixture Dynamic Modulus for Flexible Pavement Design,2021,"['Dynamic modulus', 'Ensemble method', 'Machine learning', 'MEPDG', 'Flexible Pavement']",,"The hot mix asphalt (HMA) dynamic modulus (|E*|), or stress/strain response measurement under dynamic loading, is considered the primary mechanical property input for flexible pavement in the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). The current MEPDG software, AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design (PMED) Version 2.5, employs the Witczak equation for |E*| estimation when laboratory-measured |E*| data is unavailable. This study investigates the feasibility of developing alternative |E*| prediction models with modern machine learning techniques based on an established data library of Georgia HMA mixtures involving varying binder sources, binder grades, and nominal maximum aggregate sizes. Specifically, tree-based ensemble methods, including bagging, random forest, and gradient boosting, were applied considering their superior performance, and balanced versatility and interpretability. The results revealed that the gradient boosting model produced the most accurate predictions with an R2 coefficient of determination of 0.982 as compared to the nationally calibrated Witczak model, which has an R2 of 0.392, using the same test data set. The stark discrepancy in the |E*| predictions emphasizes the need of local calibration for the MEPDG models and the high potential for developing greatly improved models using modern machine learning techniques with the local data sources. Ultimately, this study provides an excellent example for other state highway agencies to follow to facilitate their MEPDG implementation."
The application of machine learning for predicting recurrence in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer: a pilot study,2021,"['Machine learning', 'Recurrence', 'Endometrial cancer', 'Probability learning']",,"ObjectiveMost women with early stage endometrial cancer have a favorable prognosis. However, there is a subset of patientswho develop recurrence. In addition to the pathological stage, clinical and therapeutic factors affect the probabilityof recurrence. Machine learning is a subtype of artificial intelligence that is considered effective for predictive tasks.We tried to predict recurrence in early stage endometrial cancer using machine learning methods based on clinicaldata.MethodsWe enrolled 75 patients with early stage endometrial cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetricsstage I or II) who had received surgical treatment at our institute. A total of 5 machine learning classifiers were used,including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and boostedtree, to predict the recurrence based on 16 parameters (age, body mass index, gravity/parity, hypertension/diabetic,stage, histological type, grade, surgical content and adjuvant chemotherapy). We analyzed the classification accuracyand the area under the curve (AUC).ResultsThe highest accuracy was 0.82 for SVM, followed by 0.77 for RF, 0.74 for LR, 0.66 for DT, and 0.66 for boosted trees.The highest AUC was 0.53 for LR, followed by 0.52 for boosted trees, 0.48 for DT, and 0.47 for RF. Therefore, the bestpredictive model for this analysis was LR.ConclusionThe performance of the machine learning classifiers was not optimal owing to the small size of the dataset. The useof a machine learning model made it possible to predict recurrence in early stage endometrial cancer."

The Korean Triage Acuity Scale (KTAS) is mandatorily applied at EDs in South Korea.For rapid triage, we studied machine learning-based triage systems composed of a speech recognition model and natural language processing-based classification.Methods: We simulated 762 triage cases that consisted of 18 classes with six types of the main symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, fever, stroke, abdominal pain, and headache) and three levels of KTAS. In addition, we recorded conversations between emergency patients and clinicians during the simulation. We used speech recognition models to transcribe the conversation.Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) were used for KTAS and symptom classification. Additionally, we evaluated the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values of features to interpret the classifiers.Results: The character error rate of the speech recognition model was reduced to 25.21% through transfer learning. With auto-transcribed scripts, support vector machine (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–0.9), KNN (AUROC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85–0.93), RF (AUROC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.9) and BERT (AUROC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.87) achieved excellent classification performance.Based on SHAP, we found “stress”, “pain score point”, “fever”, “breath”, “head” and “chest” were the important vocabularies for determining KTAS and symptoms.Conclusion: We demonstrated the potential of an automatic KTAS classification system using speech recognition models, machine learning and BERT-based classifiers."

It forms ultra-fine particulate matter through chemical reaction and has harmful effect on both the environment and human health. In particular, ground-level SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are closely related to human activities. Satellite observations such as TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument)- derived column density data can provide spatially continuous monitoring of ground-level SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. This study aims to propose a 2-step residual corrected model to estimate ground-level SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations through the synergistic use of satellite data and numerical model output. Random forest machine learning was adopted in the 2-step residual corrected model. The proposed model was evaluated through three cross-validations (i.e., random, spatial and temporal). The results showed that the model produced slopes of 1.14-1.25, R values of 0.55-0.65, and relative root-mean-square-error of 58-63%, which were improved by 10% for slopes and 3% for R and rRMSE when compared to the model without residual correction. The model performance by country was slightly reduced in Japan, often resulting in overestimation, where the sample size was small, and the concentration level was relatively low. The spatial and temporal distributions of SO<sub>2</sub> produced by the model agreed with those of the in-situmeasurements, especially over Yangtze River Delta in China and Seoul Metropolitan Area in South Korea, which are highly dependent on the characteristics of anthropogenic emission sources. The model proposed in this study can be used for long-term monitoring of ground-level SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on both the spatial and temporal domains."

Based on the clustering pattern of the reconstructed phylogenetic tree, the dataset was divided into three groups: mammalian, avian, and fsh. We then used random forest (RF), naïve Bayes (NB), and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithms for host classifcation.Results Among the three algorithms, classifcation accuracy using kNN was highest in both LT-Ag (ACC=98.83) and VP1 (ACC=96.51). The amino acid physicochemical property most strongly correlated with host classifcation was charge, followed by solvent accessibility, polarity, and hydrophobicity in LT-Ag. However, in VP1, amino acid composition showed the highest correlation with host classifcation, followed by charge, normalized van der Waals volume, and solvent accessibility.Conclusions The results of the present study suggest the possibility of determining or predicting the host range and infection properties of PyVs at the molecular level by identifying the host species of active and emerging PyVs that exhibit diferent infection properties among diverse host species. Structural and biochemical diferences of LT-Ag and VP1 proteins in host species that refect these amino acid properties can be considered primary factors that determine the host specifcity of PyV."
Is it possible to forecast KOSPI direction using deep learning methods?,2021,"['deep learning', 'machine learning', 'time-series data', '1D-CNN', 'LSTM']",,"Deep learning methods have been developed, used in various fields, and they have shown outstanding performances in many cases. Many studies predicted a daily stock return, a classic example of time-series data, using deep learning methods. We also tried to apply deep learning methods to Korea's stock market data. We used Korea's stock market index (KOSPI) and several individual stocks to forecast daily returns and directions. We compared several deep learning models with other machine learning methods, including random forest and XGBoost. In regression, long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models are better than other prediction models. For the classification applications, there is no clear winner. However, even the best deep learning models cannot predict significantly better than the simple base model. We believe that it is challenging to predict daily stock return data even if we use the latest deep learning methods."

The timely supply of repair parts has a direct impact on weapons systems. Therefore, a demand forecast for repair parts has become a very important factor in terms of budget and equipment utilization. To improve the prediction limits with the time series model currently being applied in the Airforce, several studies focused on improving the prediction rates by adding new external variables through supervised learning. Research on improving the predictive accuracy through unsupervised learning and feature engineering has been limited. In this study, the consumption and standard unit price data of 5,752 repair accessory items from 2014 to 2019 were collected for F-15K fighter jets operated by the Airforce. In this study, the data-mining model (Randomforest, GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet regression) was used to compare the time series models with the prediction rate. The predictive power scale was RMSE (mean square root error). This study showed that data mining models have higher prediction accuracy than the time series prediction model currently applied in the Airforce. In addition, dimensionality reduction and feature engineering improve the prediction accuracy further."
Classification of Adolescent Psychiatric Patients at High Risk of Suicide Using the Personality Assessment Inventory by Machine Learning,2021,"['Suicide', 'Child and adolescent psychiatry', 'Machine learning', 'Personality Assessment Inventory-Adolescent']",,"Objective There are growing interests on suicide risk screening in clinical settings and classifying high-risk groups of suicide with suicidal ideation is crucial for a more effective suicide preventive intervention. Previous statistical techniques were limited because they tried to predict suicide risk using a simple algorithm. Machine learning differs from the traditional statistical techniques in that it generates the most optimal algorithm from various predictors. Methods We aim to analyze the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) profiles of child and adolescent patients who received outpatient psychiatric care using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), to develop and validate a classification model for individuals with high suicide risk. Results We developed prediction models using seven relevant features calculated by Boruta algorithm and subsequently tested all models using the testing dataset. The area under the ROC curve of these models were above 0.9 and the RF model exhibited the best performance. Conclusion Suicide must be assessed based on multiple aspects, and although Personality Assessment Inventory for Adolescent assess an array of domains, further research is needed for predicting high suicide risk groups."

Accurate prediction is essential for forecasting, and a prediction interval using the distribution of predicted values is more informative than a point prediction. It would be also necessary to find an appropriate distribution of predicted values for computing risk measures such as Value-at-Risk (VaR). Considering the association of pollutants, it would be desirable to fit a multivariate distribution for pollutants in predictive analysis of such as CAI. Since it is hard to treat the pollutant observations themselves to be identically distributed, here we try to measure the risk of fine dust through a 2-stage model of fitting the prediction model with explanatory variables, and then fitting a multivariate distribution to its residuals. We consider past observations of pollutants and some weather variables as explanatory variables. Linear regression, random forests and a time series model are used as prediction models, and multivariate normal distribution, multivariate normal inverse Gaussian (MNIG) distribution, and multivariate distribution using Copula are applied as residual distributions. The performance of the predictive distribution of pollutants, generated from this residual distribution and the values of explanatory variables, is verified by VaR.

In addition, the dependence of individual predictive factors on learning satisfaction was examined by calculating partial dependence plots and individual conditional expectation for predictive factors. As a result, it was judged that the K-nearest neighbor and the random forest had the best performance, and the importance of interaction and learning motivation was relatively high. In addition, it was found that the influence of the predictive factors was generally proportional to the learning satisfaction. The conclusions obtained through this study are as follows. First, each subject of the class should make efforts to maintain minimum satisfaction with media efficacy, educational support services and the quality of video lectures. Second, each subject in the class should pay attention to continuously improve the level of interaction, self-directedness, and learning motivation. Third, instructors must provide a high-quality practice environment and respond actively and promptly to problems and questions in the practice process. Fourth, instructors must identify exceptional learners and provide them with appropriate instructional practices."
A Study on the Classification of Unstructured Data through Morpheme Analysis,2021,"['Big Data', 'Data Analysis', 'Visualization', 'Textmining', 'Modeling', '빅데이터', '데이터분석', '시각화', '텍스트마이닝', '모델링']",,"In the era of big data, interest in data is exploding. In particular, the development of the Internet and social media has led to the creation of new data, enabling the realization of the era of big data and artificial intelligence and opening a new chapter in convergence technology. Also, in the past, there are many demands for analysis of data that could not be handled by programs.  In this paper, an analysis model was designed and verified for classification of unstructured data, which is often required in the era of big data. Data crawled DBPia’s thesis summary, main words, and sub-keyword, and created a database using KoNLP’s data dictionary, and tokenized words through morpheme analysis. In addition, nouns were extracted using KAIST’s 9 part-of-speech classification system, TF-IDF values were generated, and an analysis dataset was created by combining training data and Y values. Finally, The adequacy of classification was measured by applying three analysis algorithms(random forest, SVM, decision tree) to the generated analysis dataset.  The classification model technique proposed in this paper can be usefully used in various fields such as civil complaint classification analysis and text-related analysis in addition to thesis classification."
머신러닝 기반 고속도로 내 수소충전소 최적입지 선정 연구,2021,,,"Interests in clean fuels have been soaring because of environmental problems such as air pollution and global warming. Unlike fossil fuels, hydrogen obtains public attention as a eco-friendly energy source because it releases only water when burned. Various policy efforts have been made to establish a hydrogen based transportation network. The station that supplies hydrogen to hydrogen-powered trucks is essential for building the hydrogen based logistics system. Thus, determining the optimal location of refueling stations is an important topic in the network. Although previous studies have mostly applied optimization based methodologies, this paper adopts machine learning to review spatial attributes of candidate locations in selecting the optimal position of the refueling stations. Machine learning shows outstanding performance in various fields. However, it has not yet applied to an optimal location selection problem of hydrogen refueling stations. Therefore, several machine learning models are applied and compared in performance by setting variables relevant to the location of highway rest areas and random points on a highway. The results show that Random Forest model is superior in terms of F1-score. We believe that this work can be a starting point to utilize machine learning based methods as the preliminary review for the optimal sites of the stations before the optimization applies."

Hygiene and sanitation in automated processing facilities have been an important issue. This research aimed to develop a line-scan hyperspectral imaging technique for detecting spinach droplets on a stainless steel surface.Methods The hyperspectral imaging system uses UV-A (365 nm) light sources to obtain 3D hypercube data with spatial and spectral data in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) region ranging from 400 to 1000 nm. Freshly made 100% spinach juice and distilled water were used to prepare juice dilutions at 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, and 1% juice. For each of the six juice concentrations, fifteen droplets were placed on a stainless steel sheet, and VNIR hyperspectral image data was collected for the 6 × 15 array of droplets on the metal sheet. To detect and classify the diluted droplets on the spectral domain, three classification models (support vector machine, partial least square discriminant analysis, and random forest) and six pre-processing methods were implemented.Results Among them, support vector machine (SVM) showed the best classification accuracy with A = 0.95. Besides, the classification model used to reduce the number of wavelengths and calculation time, the genetic algorithm (GA) applied to the SVM showed the most accurate result as A = 0.90 among three methods.Conclusions The developed classifier demonstrated potential for detecting and classifying spinach juice droplets on the surface of stainless steel sheet metal."

This paper examines the suitability of multiple meteorological datasets for the rice yield modeling in South Korea, 1996-2019, and a hindcast experiment for rice yield using a machine learning method by considering the nonlinear relationships between meteorological variables and the rice yield. In addition to the ASOS in-situ observations, we used CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 and ERA5 reanalysis. From the multiple meteorological datasets, we extracted the four common variables (air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation) and analyzed the characteristics of each data and the associations with rice yields. CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 showed an overall agreement with the other datasets. While relative humidity had a rare relationship with rice yields, solar radiation showed a somewhat high correlation with rice yields. Using the air temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation of July, August, and September, we built a random forest model for the hindcast experiments of rice yields. The model with CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 showed the best performance with a correlation coefficient of 0.772. The solar radiation in the prediction model had the most significant importance among the variables, which is in accordance with the generic agricultural knowledge. This paper has an implication for selecting from multiple meteorological datasets for rice yield modeling."

We analyzed the relationships between the thermal comfort responses, physiological factors, and thermal environment to develop an accurate thermal comfort prediction model. While the skin temperature and electrodermal activity exhibited a significant relationship with the thermal state, a low heart rate was observed in a more comfortable state. Moreover, machine learning classifiers predicted the thermal comfort state achieved an accuracy of 80% in both seasons using only physiological data. Thus, the feature importance of the random forest classifier verified that physiological factors aid the prediction of thermal states significantly. The proposed prediction model can be potentially applied in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control. The high performance confirmed the use of wearable devices in identifying the thermal status of building occupants."

Impact of the Choice of Cross-Validation Techniques on the Results of Machine Learning-Based Diagnostic Applications,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'Data Analysis', 'Statistical Models', 'Diagnosis', 'Parkinson Disease']",,"Objectives: With advances in data availability and computing capabilities, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have evolved rapidly in recent years. Researchers have taken advantage of these developments in healthcare informatics and created reliable tools to predict or classify diseases using machine learning-based algorithms. To correctly quantify the performance of those algorithms, the standard approach is to use cross-validation, where the algorithm is trained on a training set, and its performance is measured on a validation set. Both datasets should be subject-independent to simulate the expected behavior of a clinical study. This study compares two cross-validation strategies, the subject-wise and the record-wise techniques; the subject-wise strategy correctly mimics the process of a clinical study, while the record-wise strategy does not. Methods: We started by creating a dataset of smartphone audio recordings of subjects diagnosed with and without Parkinson’s disease. This dataset was then divided into training and holdout sets using subject-wise and the record-wise divisions. The training set was used to measure the performance of two classifiers (support vector machine and random forest) to compare six cross-validation techniques that simulated either the subject-wise process or the record-wise process. The holdout set was used to calculate the true error of the classifiers. Results: The record-wise division and the record-wise cross-validation techniques overestimated the performance of the classifiers and underestimated the classification error. Conclusions: In a diagnostic scenario, the subject-wise technique is the proper way of estimating a model’s performance, and record-wise techniques should be avoided."

In order to improve the classification accuracy for term deposit subscriptions, many studies have been conducted based on machine learning techniques. However, even if these models can achieve satisfactory performance, utilizing them is not an easy task in the industry when their decision-making process is not adequately explained. To address this issue, this paper proposes an explainable scheme for term deposit subscription forecasting. For this, we first construct several classification models using decision tree-based ensemble learning methods, which yield excellent performance in tabular data, such as random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). We then analyze their classification performance in depth through 10-fold cross-validation. After that, we provide the rationale for interpreting the influence of customer information and the decision-making process by applying Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), an explainable artificial intelligence technique, to the best classification model. To verify the practicality and validity of our scheme, experiments were conducted with the bank marketing dataset provided by Kaggle; we applied the SHAP to the GBM and LightGBM models, respectively, according to different dataset configurations and then performed their analysis and visualization for explainable term deposit subscriptions."

First, the effect size (standard mean difference, SMD) was 0.7240, and it was evaluated as a random effect model because heterogeneity (significance p-value for Q value=0.0001, I2=89.8%) was confirmed rather than the homogeneity of the effect size. Second, the effect size of the subgroups was shown as thesis (20) SMD=0.6108 and journal (20) SMD=0.4929, and the homogeneity test result was more than 50% of I, but Q (=1.09, (d.f.=1), p<0.6943) was evaluated homogeneous because it is greater than 0.01. Third, in the moderator variables analysis, the meta-regression of the moderator variables Alpha is QM (df=1)=5.7625, p=0.0164, regression coefficient was statistically significant with z=2.4005, p=0.0164, but session time did not appear statistically significant (QM (df=1)=0.9946, p=0.3186). Fourth, in the publication bias analysis, the funnel plot was biased to the right based on effect size 0. In addition, the Egger’s regression result was dismissed as bias=3.0142 (t=1.81, df=38, p=0.0782) and there was a publication bias. In addition, the Fail-safe N analysis showed reliability by appearing as Nfs=1287, with seven adjustment values in the trim-and-fill method, the mean effect size before adjustment SMD=0.7585, and the overall effect size SMD=0.2818 after adjustment. In other words, adding seven adjusted studies solved the 'file-drawer problem' and filled the bottom left corner of the forest plot with seven effect sizes to make it symmetrical. Finally, we discussed the meanings and implications of this study to provide basic resources for conducting and researching advanced emotional coaching programs."

There are various adversarial attack algorithms. Accordingly, many studies have been conducted to detect adversarial attack but few studies have been conducted to classify what adversarial attack algorithms to generate adversarial input. if adversarial attacks can be classified, more robust deep learning classification model can be established by analyzing differences between attacks. In this paper, we proposed a model that detects and classifies adversarial attacks by constructing a random forest classification model with input features extracted from a target deep learning model.

A machine-learning study using a time series model reflecting the time series characteristics of insolation and meteorological variables affecting insolation was performed. This study presents a model for predicting insolation in a tree-based ensemble that considers both atmospheric pollutant concentrations and meteorological variables that can affect surface insolation. The research data were collected from the Korea Meteorological Administrator and Air Korea, and the research period was between 2015 and 2019. The daily insolation was predicted through machine learning, Random Forest (RF), gradient boosting model (GBM), and XGboost. 5-fold cross-validation was used for model validation, and prediction performance was compared with mean absolute value error, root mean square error, and coefficient of determination. GBM was the best predictive performance among models through 5-fold cross-validation, but with overfitting. Therefore, as a result of applying the optimized parameters, the RF prediction was the best. Both sunshine time and duration were very important variables.

The HRES system is connected to the grid system to meet required load demand and the integrated design creates the power quality (PQ) issues in the system due to non-linear load, critical load and unbalanced load conditions. Hence, in this paper, atom search optimization (ASO) with unifi ed power quality conditioner (UPQC) is designed to solve the PQ issues in HRES system. The main objective of the work is the mitigation of PQ issues and compensate load demand in HRES system. The PQ issue problems are solved with the help of UPQC device in the system. The UPQC performance is increased by introducing fractional order proportional integral derivative (FOPID) with ASO based controller in series and shunt active power fi lter to mitigate PQ issues of current and voltage. Initially, HRES is designed with photovoltaic (PV) system, wind turbine (WT) and battery energy storage system (BESS) which connected with the load system. To analysis the presentation of the proposed controller structure, the non-linear load is connected with the system to create PQ issues in the system. The PQ issues are mitigated and load demand is reimbursed with the assistance of HRES system. The proposed method is employed in the MATLAB/Simulink platform and performances were analysed.Three diff erent cases are used to validate the performance of the proposed method such as Sag, Swell, and disturbances.Additionally, total harmonic distortion (THD) is analysed.

This includes the problem of classification for time series data. In this study, the method of using the discrete wavelet transform is introduced to the classification problem of time series data and applied to actual data analysis. Discrete wavelet transform is an advanced form of Fourier analysis that does not contain time information, and has the advantage of simultaneously increasing temporal resolution and frequency resolution, so it is effective in the classification problem of non-stationary time series data. Decision tree, naive Bayesian, k-NN, SVM, and random forest methods were used as classification models. And various measures, which include accuracy, kappa coefficient, F1-score, ARI, were used for performance comparison. As a result of applying these methods to time series data observing concentration of hydrochloric acid, it was confirmed that the method using discrete wavelets analysis performed better than the result of applying the classification model directly to the raw data or the result using the Fourier transform (or short time Fourier transform).

Although on-demand production companies also want to reduce corporate risks such as delays in delivery by predicting total production time for orders, they are having difficulty predicting this because the total production time is all different for each order. The Theory of Constraints (TOC) theory was developed to find the least efficient areas to increase order throughput and reduce order total cost, but failed to provide a forecast of total production time. Order production varies from order to order due to various customer needs, so the total production time of individual orders can be measured postmortem, but it is difficult to predict in advance. The total measured production time of existing orders is also different, which has limitations that cannot be used as standard time. As a result, experienced managers rely on persimmons rather than on the use of the system, while inexperienced managers use simple management indicators (e.g., 60 days total production time for raw materials, 90 days total production time for steel plates, etc.). Too fast work instructions based on imperfections or indicators cause congestion, which leads to productivity degradation, and too late leads to increased production costs or failure to meet delivery dates due to emergency processing. Failure to meet the deadline will result in compensation for delayed compensation or adversely affect business and collection sectors. In this study, to address these problems, an entity that operates an order production system seeks to find a machine learning model that estimates the total production time of new orders. It uses orders, production, and process performance for materials used for machine learning. We compared and analyzed OLS, GLM Gamma, Extra Trees, and Random Forest algorithms as the best algorithms for estimating total production time and present the results."

The main travel routes of taxi users were found through the driving route. As a result of the loading rate analysis, it was confirmed that the loading rate was high in Dongseong-ro, the downtown area of Daegu Metropolitan City, and the nearby area of Dongdaegu Station. The following high passenger rate region was analyzed as the region with a high proportion of commercial facilities. In the case of movement routes, it was confirmed that they appear mainly along the same axis as subway lines and major arterial roads in the city. And through this, it was possible to obtain the implication that the infrastructure for shared autonomous vehicles could be built along arterial roads, auxiliary arterial roads, and subway lines in the future. In addition, this study established a regression model using machine learning techniques such as Random forest and LightGBM to confirm the variables that affect the user’s choice to use a taxi. The distance to the subway station, the arterial road, the number of floating population, the card sales performance, and the distance to the bus stop were derived as the primary variables that affect the decision of the taxi route. As a result of model estimation, it was found that both regression models secured the fit.

온라인 게임 로그 데이터 클러스터링 기반 일일 단위 게임봇 판별,2021,"['Online-game security', 'Bot detection', 'Data clustering', 'Categorizing']","온라인 게임 봇은 이미 수 많은 방식을 통해 사람들에게 알려져 왔으며, 사용자의 게임 흥미 저하, 게임 내 경제순환 파괴, 게임 컨텐츠 및 수명 단축 등 많은 문제점을 야기한다. 정상적이지 않은 게임 봇 운영을 방치하는 것은 장기적으로 게임 제작사와 게임 플레이어에게 모두 악영향을 미치게 되므로 이에 대한 탐지 및 제재는 필수가 되었다. 하지만 제재 단계에서 생기는 오인 제재의 딜레마를 피하기 쉽지 않다. 게임사 측에서 유저를 제재하기 위해서는 객관적인 분석 지표인 로그를 가지고 제재 여부를 판단해야 하며, 로그에서 추출한 정보를 근거로 확보해야 한다.  본 연구에서는 탐지 대상 기간의 로그에 대하여 이를 일일 단위로 나누어서 게임봇 유저 판별을 수행할 것이다. 일일 단위 탐지를 위해 탐지 기간을 하루 단위로 나누어 해당 일자에 대한 게임봇 여부를 우선 판별하고, 이후 최종결과를 판단하였다. 제안한 방법론을 통해 일반 유저 스타일과 게임봇 유저 스타일이 섞여 있는 경우를 쉽게 탐지해 낼 수 있을 것이다. 본 논문에서 제안한 방법론으로 테스트한 결과, 분류 정확도를 확인할 수 있는 지표 중 하나인 F1-score가 0.898에서 0.945로 향상되었다.","Online game-bots are already known for a lot of persons by various ways. It leads to problems such as declining game player’s interest, in-game financial crisis, etc. Detecting and restricting of game-bot is now essential. Because both publishers and players get disadvantages from their long term abnormal working. But it is not easy to restrict, because of false restriction risks. Game publishers need to distinguish game-bot from server-side game logs. At last, it should can make reasons for game-bot restriction.  In this paper, we classified game-bot users by using daily separated game logs for testing data. For daily-driven detection, we separated total dataset into one day logs. Preliminary detects game-bots with one day logs, and determines total results by using these data. Daily driven detection advantages on detection which contains combined game playing style. Which shows like normal user and game-bot. These methodology shows better F1-score, which one of indicator which demonstrate classification accuracy. It increases from 0.898 to 0.945 by using Random Forest classifier."
