Deep Learning Machine Vision System with High Object Recognition Rate using Multiple-Exposure Image Sensing Method,2021,"['Deep learning', 'object recognition', 'machine vision system', 'multiple exposure', 'wide dynamic range']",,"In this study, we propose a machine vision system with a high object recognition rate. By utilizing a multiple-exposure image sensing technique, the proposed deep learning-based machine vision system can cover a wide light intensity range without further learning processes on the various light intensity range. If the proposed machine vision system fails to recognize object features, the system operates in a multiple-exposure sensing mode and detects the target object that is blocked in the near dark or bright region. Furthermore, shortand long-exposure images from the multiple-exposure sensing mode are synthesized to obtain accurate object feature information. That results in the generation of a wide dynamic range of image information. Even with the object recognition resources for the deep learning process with a light intensity range of only 23 dB, the prototype machine vision system with the multiple-exposure imaging method demonstrated an object recognition performance with a light intensity range of up to 96 dB."

In fact, artificial intelligence, such as intelligent surveillance cameras and other security systems, is used to solve various problems or provide convenience, providing solutions to problems that humans traditionally had to manually deal with one at a time. Among them, information security is one of the domains where the use of artificial intelligence is especially needed because the frequency of occurrence and processing capacity of dangerous codes exceeds the capabilities of humans. Therefore, this study intends to examine the definition of artificial intelligence and machine learning, its execution method, process, learning algorithm, and cases of utilization in various domains, particularly the cases and contents of artificial intelligence technology used in the field of information security.

Machine Learning Aided Tracking Analysis of Haze Pollution and Regional Heterogeneity,2021,"['Haze Pollution', 'Machine Learning', 'Tourism Flows', 'Spatial Effect', 'Regional Heterogeneity']",,"Not only can air pollution reduce the overall competitiveness of tourist destinations, but also changes tourists' travel decisions, thereby affecting the tourism flows. The study presents a machine learning method to analyze how the haze pollution puts spatial effect on tourism flows in China from 2001 to 2018, and reveals the regional differences in heterogeneity among eastern, central, and western China. Our investigation reveals three interesting observations. First, the Environmental Kuznets Curve of the impact of haze pollution on tourism flows is not significant. In the eastern and western regions, the interaction between haze pollution and domestic tourism flows as well as inbound tourism flows shows an inverted U-shaped curve respectively. Second, there is an significantly positive spillover effect of tourism flows in all of the eastern, central, and western regions. As to the intensity of spillover, domestic tourism flows is higher than that of the inbound tourism flows. Both of the above figures are greatest in the eastern. Third, the Chinese haze pollution mainly reduces the inbound tourism flows, and only imposes significantly negative direct effects on the domestic tourism flows in the central region. In the central and eastern regions, significantly negative direct effects and spillover effects are exerted on inbound tourism."

To effectively prevent such illegal and unfair debt collection activities, we need a method for strengthening the monitoring of illegal collection activities even with little manpower using technologies such as unstructured data machine learning. In this study, we propose a classification model for illegal debt collection that combine machine learning such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a rule-based technique that obtains the collection transcript of loan companies and converts them into text data to identify illegal activities. Moreover, the study also compares how accurate identification was made in accordance with the machine learning algorithm. The study shows that a case of using the combination of the rule-based illegal rules and machine learning for classification has higher accuracy than the classification model of the previous study that applied only machine learning. This study is the first attempt to classify illegalities by combining rule-based illegal detection rules with machine learning.

Machine Learning Approach to Personality Assessment and Its Application to Personnel Selection: A Brief Review of the Current Research and Suggestions for the Future,2021,"['personality measurement', 'machine learning', 'social media text mining', 'validity.', '성격검사', '머신러닝', '소셜미디어 텍스트 마이닝', '타당성']",,"As we enter the digital age, new methods of personality testing-namely, machine learning-based personality assessment scales-are quickly gaining attraction. Because machine learning-based personality assessments are made based on algorithms that analyze digital footprints of people’s online behaviors, they are supposedly less prone to human biases or cognitive fallacies that are often cited as limitations of traditional personality tests. As a result, machine learning-based assessment tools are becoming increasingly popular in operational settings across the globe with the anticipation that they can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional personality testing. However, the provision of scientific evidence regarding the psychometric soundness and the fairness of machine learning-based assessment tools have lagged behind their use in practice. The current paper provides a brief review of empirical studies that have examined the validity of machine learning-based personality assessment, focusing primarily on social media text mining method. Based on this review, we offer some suggestions about future research directions, particularly regarding the important and immediate need to examine the machine learning-based personality assessment tools’ compliance with the practical and legal standards for use in practice (such as inter-algorithm reliability, test-retest reliability, and differential prediction across demographic groups). Additionally, we emphasize that the goal of machine learning-based personality assessment tools should not be to simply maximize the prediction of personality ratings. Rather, we should explore ways to use this new technology to further develop our fundamental understanding of human personality and to contribute to the development of personality theory."
An Efficient Parallel Machine Learning-based Blockchain Framework,2021,"['Machine learning', 'Blockchain', 'Deep learning']",,"The unlimited possibilities of machine learning have been shown in several successful reports and applications. However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain."
A feasible strain-history extraction method using machine learning for the durability evaluation of automotive parts,2021,['· Strain evaluation · Automobile components · Damage estimation · Machine learning · Artificial intelligence'],,"The feasibility of a machine-learning algorithm is discussed in terms of strainhistory prediction and durability evaluation of automotive components. Additionally, an additional benefit using the machine-learning is reported; that is the acquisition of strain histories from sensors other than strain-gages. More specifically, the strain-history prediction performance was compared depending on how to prepare and learn data from each driving event, and the accuracy was analyzed with respect to the dominant direction of wheel-forces. Moreover, detailed information on the strain-history extraction was provided. Consequently, the performance of the network that learned the data generated from whole PG was better than one that learned a single driving data. For better application of machine learning to strain estimation for automotive components, timesteps of 80 were found to be the optimal parameter. And it was suggested that the data ranges for machine-learning training be larger than that in realapplication to minimize discrepancies around peaks."
Comparison of RCF Scoring System to Clinical Decision for the Rey Complex Figure Using Machine-Learning Algorithm,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure', 'Mild Cognitive Impairment', 'Dementia', 'Neuropsychological Test']",,"Background and Purpose: Interpreting the Rey complex figure (RCF) requires a standard RCF scoring system and clinical decision by clinicians. The interpretation of RCF using clinical decision by clinicians might not be accurate in the diagnosing of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia patients in comparison with the RCF scoring system. For this reason, a machine-learning algorithm was used to demonstrate that scoring RCF using clinical decision is not as accurate as of the RCF scoring system in predicting MCI or mild dementia patients from normal subjects.Methods: The RCF dataset consisted of 2,232 subjects with formal neuropsychological assessments. The RCF dataset was classified into 2 datasets. The first dataset was to compare normal vs. abnormal and the second dataset was to compare normal vs. MCI vs. mild dementia. Models were trained using a convolutional neural network for machine learning. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of models.Results: The trained model's accuracy for predicting cognitive states was 96% with the first dataset (normal vs. abnormal) and 88% with the second dataset (normal vs. MCI vs. mild dementia). The model had a sensitivity of 85% for detecting abnormal with an AUC of 0.847 with the first dataset. It had a sensitivity of 78% for detecting MCI or mild dementia with an AUC of 0.778 with the second dataset.Conclusions: Based on this study, the RCF scoring system has the potential to present more accurate criteria than the clinical decision for distinguishing cognitive impairment among patients."
Machine-Learning-Based Approach to Differential Diagnosis in Tuberculous and Viral Meningitis,2021,"['Tuberculosis', 'Virus', 'Meningitis', 'Machine learning', 'Diagnosis']",,"Background: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis, but differentiating between the diagnosis of TBM and viral meningitis (VM) is difficult. Thus, we have developed machine-learning modules for differentiating TBM from VM.Material and Methods: For the training data, confirmed or probable TBM and confirmed VM cases were retrospectively collected from five teaching hospitals in Korea between January 2000 - July 2018. Various machine-learning algorithms were used for training. The machinelearning algorithms were tested by the leave-one-out cross-validation. Four residents and two infectious disease specialists were tested using the summarized medical information.Results: The training study comprised data from 60 patients with confirmed or probable TBM and 143 patients with confirmed VM. Older age, longer symptom duration before the visit, lower serum sodium, lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose, higher CSF protein, and CSF adenosine deaminase were found in the TBM patients. Among the various machinelearning algorithms, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics of artificial neural network (ANN) with ImperativeImputer for matrix completion (0.85; 95% confidence interval 0.79 - 0.89) was found to be the highest. The AUC of the ANN model was statistically higher than those of all the residents (range 0.67 - 0.72, P <0.001) and an infectious disease specialist (AUC 0.76; P = 0.03).Conclusion: The machine-learning techniques may play a role in differentiating between TBM and VM. Specifically, the ANN model seems to have better diagnostic performance than the non-expert clinician."

Five machine learning methods were applied and compared for the prediction of VMS, measured by the Menopause Rating Scale. Variable importance, the effect of a variable on model performance, was used for identifying the major factors associated with VMS.Results: In terms of the mean squared error, the random forest (0.9326) was much better than linear regression (12.4856) and artificial neural networks with one, two, and three hidden layers (1.5576, 1.5184, and 1.5833, respectively). Based on the variable importance from the random forest, the most important factors associated with VMS were age, menopause age, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and monocyte, triglyceride, gamma glutamyl transferase, blood urea nitrogen, cancer antigen 19-9, C-reactive protein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Indeed, the following variables were ranked within the top 20 in terms of variable importance: cancer antigen 125, total cholesterol, insulin, free thyroxine, forced vital capacity, alanine aminotransferase, forced expired volume in 1 second, height, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, and carcinoembryonic antigen.Conclusion: Machine learning provides an invaluable decision support system for the prediction of VMS. For managing VMS, comprehensive consideration is needed regarding thyroid function, lipid profile, liver function, inflammation markers, insulin resistance, monocyte count, cancer antigens, and lung function."
Impact of the Choice of Cross-Validation Techniques on the Results of Machine Learning-Based Diagnostic Applications,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'Data Analysis', 'Statistical Models', 'Diagnosis', 'Parkinson Disease']",,"Objectives: With advances in data availability and computing capabilities, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have evolved rapidly in recent years. Researchers have taken advantage of these developments in healthcare informatics and created reliable tools to predict or classify diseases using machine learning-based algorithms. To correctly quantify the performance of those algorithms, the standard approach is to use cross-validation, where the algorithm is trained on a training set, and its performance is measured on a validation set. Both datasets should be subject-independent to simulate the expected behavior of a clinical study. This study compares two cross-validation strategies, the subject-wise and the record-wise techniques; the subject-wise strategy correctly mimics the process of a clinical study, while the record-wise strategy does not. Methods: We started by creating a dataset of smartphone audio recordings of subjects diagnosed with and without Parkinson’s disease. This dataset was then divided into training and holdout sets using subject-wise and the record-wise divisions. The training set was used to measure the performance of two classifiers (support vector machine and random forest) to compare six cross-validation techniques that simulated either the subject-wise process or the record-wise process. The holdout set was used to calculate the true error of the classifiers. Results: The record-wise division and the record-wise cross-validation techniques overestimated the performance of the classifiers and underestimated the classification error. Conclusions: In a diagnostic scenario, the subject-wise technique is the proper way of estimating a model’s performance, and record-wise techniques should be avoided."

Machine Learning-based Automatic Optical Inspection System with Multimodal Optical Image Fusion Network,2021,"['Deep learning', 'defect detection', 'machine vision', 'optical system.']",,"This paper proposes an automatic cast product surface defect detection system based on deep learning artificial intelligence technology. Application of deep learning is difficult because of the uneven surface and small defects of the cast product which are easily affected by the lighting position and angle. Therefore, three channel fusion data from an optical system that simultaneously acquires a 2D surface image and 3D shape information of the target object were obtained and used for deep learning. The mean average precision (mAP) of the proposed defect detection model using the three-channel fusion data is about 77%. And this result is greater than the 60% mAP of a defect detection model that uses single-channel data. For further optimization, we investigate a deep learning modelthat employs a deep learning network with multiple models, where each model trains and detects only a single type of defect. The experimental results demonstrate that the mAP of the model was improved to 88%."

It will instead use a gradient boosting machine learning algorithm. This study will also analyze the predictive factors of depression by gender and suggests directions of intervention for depression in senior citizens. Data from the ‘Korean National Survey on the Elderly’ were used in this study. The participants were 12,544 elderly males and 18,425 elderly females. This study set 56 factors as explanatory variables based on stress-coping theory for the variables verified in previous studies, estimated a predictive model, and analyzed predictors by gender. The model performance of elderly males and females was evaluated, respectively, using six classification performance metrics: Accuracy was 76.0% and 73.9%. Recall was 60.7% and 73.3%.

Day-to-day health and small social activities were important in developing a predictive model for individuals’ depression levels. The predictors that have shown notable gender differences were marital relationships and exercise. This study demonstrated that it could be possible to predict geriatric depression with the factors that were recognizable to people close to the elderly. This predictive model can be used to identifying at-risk elderly individuals in the social welfare sector.

Machine Learning Approach for Active Vaccine Safety Monitoring,2021,"['Vaccines', 'Adverse Effects', 'Postmarketing Product Surveillance', 'Machine Learning', 'Cross-over Studies']",,"Background: Vaccine safety surveillance is important because it is related to vaccine hesitancy, which affects vaccination rate. To increase confidence in vaccination, the active monitoring of vaccine adverse events is important. For effective active surveillance, we developed and verified a machine learning-based active surveillance system using national claim data.Methods: We used two databases, one from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, which contains flu vaccination records for the elderly, and another from the National Health Insurance Service, which contains the claim data of vaccinated people. We developed a casecrossover design based machine learning model to predict the health outcome of interest events (anaphylaxis and agranulocytosis) using a random forest. Feature importance values were evaluated to determine candidate associations with each outcome. We investigated the relationship of the features to each event via a literature review, comparison with the Side Effect Resource, and using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation method.Results: The trained model predicted each health outcome of interest with a high accuracy (approximately 70%). We found literature supporting our results, and most of the important drug-related features were listed in the Side Effect Resource database as inducing the health outcome of interest. For anaphylaxis, flu vaccination ranked high in our feature importance analysis and had a positive association in Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation analysis. Although the feature importance of vaccination was lower for agranulocytosis, it also had a positive relationship in the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation analysis.Conclusion: We developed a machine learning-based active surveillance system for detecting possible factors that can induce adverse events using health claim and vaccination databases.The results of the study demonstrated a potentially useful application of two linked national health record databases. Our model can contribute to the establishment of a system for conducting active surveillance on vaccination."
Machine learning-based prediction of Sasang constitution types using comprehensive clinical information and identification of key features for diagnosis,2021,"['Sasang constitutional medicine', 'Machine learning', 'Extremely randomized trees', 'Diagnostic model', 'Feature importance']",,"Background: Despite the importance of accurate Sasang type diagnosis, a unique form of Korean medicine, there have been concerns about consistency among diagnoses. We investigate a data-driven integrative diagnostic model by applying machine learning to a multicenter clinical dataset with comprehensive features.Methods: Extremely randomized trees (ERT), support vector machines, multinomial logistic regression, and K-nearest neighbor were applied, and performances were evaluated by cross-validation. The feature importance of the classifier was analyzed to understand which information is crucial in diagnosis.Results: The ERT classifier showed the highest performance, with an overall f1 score of 0.60 ± 0.060. The feature classes of body measurement, personality, general information, and cold–heat were more decisive than others in classifying Sasang types. Costal angle was the most informative feature. In pairwise classification, we found Sasang type-dependent distinctions that body measurement features played a key role in TE-SE and TE-SY datasets, while personality and cold–heat features showed importance in SE-SY dataset.Conclusion: Current study investigated a comprehensive diagnostic model for Sasang type using machine learning and achieved better performance than previous studies. This study helps data-driven decision making in clinics by revealing key features contributing to the Sasang type diagnosis."

Radiomics features were extracted from chest CT of the patients. The data of the cohort were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets using a 7:1:2 ratio. A ML pipeline consisting of a model to predict severity and time-to-event model to predict progression to critical illness were trained on radiomics features and clinical variables. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC), concordance index (C-index), and time-dependent ROC-AUC were calculated to determine model performance, which was compared with consensus CT severity scores obtained by visual interpretation by radiologists.Results: Among 981 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 274 patients developed critical illness. Radiomics features and clinical variables resulted in the best performance for the prediction of disease severity with a highest test ROC-AUC of 0.76 compared with 0.70 (0.76 vs. 0.70, p = 0.023) for visual CT severity score and clinical variables. The progression prediction model achieved a test C-index of 0.868 when it was based on the combination of CT radiomics and clinical variables compared with 0.767 when based on CT radiomics features alone (p < 0.001), 0.847 when based on clinical variables alone (p = 0.110), and 0.860 when based on the combination of visual CT severity scores and clinical variables (p = 0.549). Furthermore, the model based on the combination of CT radiomics and clinical variables achieved time-dependent ROC-AUCs of 0.897, 0.933, and 0.927 for the prediction of progression risks at 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively.Conclusion: CT radiomics features combined with clinical variables were predictive of COVID-19 severity and progression to critical illness with fairly high accuracy."

Machine learning-based personal thermal comfort model for electric vehicles with local infrared radiant warmers,2021,['· Electric vehicle · Local radiant heating · Personal thermal comfort · Machine learning · Random forest algorithm'],,"Thermal comfort of occupants in conventional vehicles driven by an internal combustion engine is controlled by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.However, the operation of a conventional HVAC system decreases the mileage of electric vehicle (EV) in the heating mode by nearly 50 %. Thus, local radiant heating was proposed as a heating strategy to reduce electric energy consumption while providing reasonable thermal comfort. In this work, we developed a personalized overall thermal sensation (OS) model using machine learning to evaluate the thermopsychological effect of local radiant heating and simulate the OS of occupants in EVs. Data were obtained from a real EV that went through a cold environmental chamber and were evaluated using random forest algorithm. By considering individual thermal preferences of occupants, we predicted the OS for each subject with higher accuracy by a factor of 2.6 compared with the prediction performed using the weighted average method. Total energy consumption was reduced by approximately 10 % in the EV equipped with local infrared radiant warmers while providing OS that was comparable with that of the HVAC system."

Furthermore, clinical utility of a machine learning–based approach has not been widely studied.Materials and Methods Immunohistochemistry for TILs against CD3, CD8, and forkhead box P3 in both center and invasive margin of the tumor were performed using surgically resected T1 CRC slides. Three hundred and sixteen patients were enrolled and categorized into training (n=221) and validation (n=95) sets via random sampling. Using clinicopathologic variables including TILs, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was applied for variable selection and predictive signature building in the training set. The predictive accuracy of our model and the Japanese criteria were compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), net reclassification improvement (NRI)/integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and decision curve analysis (DCA) in the validation set.Results LNM was detected in 29 (13.1%) and 12 (12.6%) patients in training and validation sets, respectively. Nine variables were selected and used to generate the LASSO model. Its performance was similar in training and validation sets (AUROC, 0.795 vs. 0.765; p=0.747). In the validation set, the LASSO model showed better outcomes in predicting LNM than Japanese criteria, as measured by AUROC (0.765 vs. 0.518, p=0.003) and NRI (0.447, p=0.039)/IDI (0.121, p=0.034). DCA showed positive net benefits in using our model.Conclusion Our LASSO model incorporating histopathologic parameters and TILs showed superior performance compared to conventional Japanese criteria in predicting LNM in patients with T1 CRC."

Regional Integration Clusters and Optimum Customs Unions: A Machine-Learning Approach,2021,"['Regional Integration', 'Customs Union', 'Machine Learning']",,"This study proposes a new method to evaluate the composition of regional arrangements focused on increasing intraregional trade and economic integration. In contrast to previous studies that take the country composition of these arrangements as given, our method uses a network clustering algorithm adapted from the machine-learning literature to identify, in a data-driven way, those groups of neighboring countries that are most integrated with each other. Using the obtained landscape of regional integration clusters (RICs) as a benchmark, we then apply our method to critically assess the composition of real-world customs unions (CUs). Our results indicate a considerable variation across CUs in terms of their distance to the RICs emerging from the clustering algorithm. This suggests that some CUs are relatively more driven by “natural” economic forces, as opposed to political considerations. Our results also point to several testable hypotheses related to the geopolitical configuration of CUs."

However, there is a subset of patientswho develop recurrence. In addition to the pathological stage, clinical and therapeutic factors affect the probabilityof recurrence. Machine learning is a subtype of artificial intelligence that is considered effective for predictive tasks.We tried to predict recurrence in early stage endometrial cancer using machine learning methods based on clinicaldata.MethodsWe enrolled 75 patients with early stage endometrial cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetricsstage I or II) who had received surgical treatment at our institute. A total of 5 machine learning classifiers were used,including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and boostedtree, to predict the recurrence based on 16 parameters (age, body mass index, gravity/parity, hypertension/diabetic,stage, histological type, grade, surgical content and adjuvant chemotherapy). We analyzed the classification accuracyand the area under the curve (AUC).ResultsThe highest accuracy was 0.82 for SVM, followed by 0.77 for RF, 0.74 for LR, 0.66 for DT, and 0.66 for boosted trees.The highest AUC was 0.53 for LR, followed by 0.52 for boosted trees, 0.48 for DT, and 0.47 for RF. Therefore, the bestpredictive model for this analysis was LR.ConclusionThe performance of the machine learning classifiers was not optimal owing to the small size of the dataset. The useof a machine learning model made it possible to predict recurrence in early stage endometrial cancer."
A Review of Optimal Energy Management Strategies Using Machine Learning Techniques for Hybrid Electric Vehicles,2021,"['Hybrid electric vehicle', 'Energy management strategy', 'Machine learning', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Optimal control theory']",,"A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is defined as a vehicle that has two or more power sources, the hybrid electric vehicle is a representative eco-friendly vehicle because it can operate efficiently with each power source and requires only a small sized electric power source. However, it is not possible to develop high efficiency HEVs without an effective energy management system (EMS), a well-designed EMS is vital in HEVs because they need to manage two power sources. Motivated by this, there are continuing efforts being made to research and establish suitable energy management strategies in order to develop high efficiency HEVs. In the past, many energy management strategies for HEVs were developed based on optimal control theory. Recently, various kinds of machine learning technologies have been applied to HEV EMS development based on breakthroughs in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning is a field of research that allows computers to perform arbitrary tasks guided by data rather than explicit programming. Machine learning can be classified into supervised learning, reinforcement learning (semi-supervised learning), and unsupervised learning depending on how the training data is structured. In this study, we look at cases and studies in which machine learning techniques from each category were used to develop HEV energy management strategies."

Materials and Methods: Two hundred panoramic radiographs from 100 patients (50 males and 50 females) were randomly selected from a private radiological service database. Initially, 14 linear and angular measurements of the radiographs were made by an expert. Eight ratio indices derived from the original measurements were applied to a statistical algorithm to match radiographs from the same patients, simulating a semi-automated personal identification process. Subsequently, measurements were automatically generated using a deep neural network for image recognition, simulating a fully automated personal identification process. Results: Approximately 85% of the radiographs were correctly matched by the automated personal identification process. In a limited number of cases, the image recognition algorithm identified 2 potential matches for the same individual. No statistically significant differences were found between measurements performed by the expert on panoramic radiographs from the same patients. Conclusion: Personal identification might be performed with the aid of image recognition algorithms and machine learning techniques. This approach will likely facilitate the complex task of personal identification by performing an initial screening of radiographs and matching ante-mortem and post-mortem images from the same individuals."

Machine learning for the diagnosis of early-stage diabetes using temporal glucose profiles,2021,['Machine learning · Diagnosing diabetes · Insulin resistance'],,"Machine learning shows remarkable success for recognizing patterns in data. Here, we apply machine learning (ML) for the diagnosis of early-stage diabetes, which is known as a challenging task in medicine. Blood glucose levels are tightly regulated by two counter-regulatory hormones, insulin and glucagon, and the failure of glucose homeostasis leads to a common metabolic disease, diabetes mellitus. It is a chronic disease that has a long latent period that complicates detection of the disease at an early stage. The vast majority of diabetes cases result from that diminished effectiveness of insulin action, and that insulin resistance modifies the temporal profile of blood glucose. Thus, we propose to use ML to detect subtle changes in the temporal pattern of the glucose concentration. Time series data on blood glucose with sufficient resolution is currently unavailable, so we confirm the proposal by using synthetic glucose profiles produced using a biophysical model that considers glucose regulation and hormone action.

However, with the recent advances in technology, machine learning (ML) has become one of the widely spoken methods to generate insights with more ease of use.While the followers of statistical methods have a differing view point about ML, and the followers of ML have a differing viewpoint about SM, this article isolates the merits of each of these two methods and advances arguments for when to use what method based on the purpose, context, frequency of use, cost, expertise and time. To be specific, the main purpose of SM is for inference and that of ML is prediction. Further, this article goes one step further and creates a scenario where it shows that when we combine the learning from using a statistical method and apply it to machine learning, the ultimate benefit can be greater than the sum of each method’s benefits."

In this paper, we define features that can be detected from the ego vehicle via on-board sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V). Gini Impurity is used to select the most appropriate features. Additionally, we compare several machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), long short term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU), to find the best algorithm to predict lane changes. We evaluate the performance of these four algorithms on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset, which was collected by the Federal Highway Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Predictive maintenance of abnormal wind turbine events by using machine learning based on condition monitoring for anomaly detection,2021,['· Wind turbine · Predictive maintenance · Anomaly detection · Machine learning · Data argumentation'],,"The predictive maintenance of wind turbines has become a critical issue with the rapid development of wind power generation. The early detection of abnormal operation conditions can prevent failure status, which takes a long time to recover. Energy waste can also be reduced while maintenance efficiency can be improved by using a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to monitor the operation status of wind turbines. Massive data are generated from different sensors during wind turbine operation, and SCADA can be used to gather reports about hundreds of possible abnormal conditions. The popular maintenance methods have been mostly designed on the basis of statistical analysis and data mining.However, such schemes need not only big data but also sophisticated processing techniques.This study addresses the aforementioned challenges by proposing a deep learning model with comprehensive data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning on batch size to achieve abnormal early detection. The necessary data preprocessing is initially conducted besides the conventional data cleaning and normalization steps, and time-series data windowing and label settings are also performed. Then, the imbalanced classes in the records are addressed by adopting an augmentation scheme called the synthetic minority oversampling technique.Principal component analysis is also used to enhance the training. Finally, the proposed deep learning method with fine-tuning is compared with three machine learning models for early anomaly event detection. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can identify potential faults 72 hours before they occur, and the precision rate exceeds 90 %."

Prediction of critical heat flux for narrow rectangular channels in a steady state condition using machine learning,2021,"['Narrow rectangular channel', 'Critical heat flux', 'Machine learning', 'Neural network', 'Downward flow']",,"The subchannel of a research reactor used to generate high power density is designed to be narrow and rectangular and comprises plate-type fuels operating under downward flow conditions. Critical heat flux (CHF) is a crucial parameter for estimating the safety of a nuclear fuel; hence, this parameter should be accurately predicted. Here, machine learning is applied for the prediction of CHF in a narrow rectangular channel. Although machine learning can effectively analyze large amounts of complex data, its application to CHF, particularly for narrow rectangular channels, remains challenging because of the limited flow conditions available in existing experimental databases. To resolve this problem, we used four CHF correlations to generate pseudo-data for training an artificial neural network.

Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting the Returns of IPO Companies,2021,"['Initial public offering', 'Stock return', 'Forecasting', 'Machine learning', 'Deep learning']",,"Initial public offering (IPO) refers to the recruitment or sale of shares of a company to general investors to list the shares on the stock exchange. Determining the offer price is a type of corporate valuation. It has been consistently highlighted that the offer price does not properly reflect the corporate value in the Korean domestic IPO market. In most studies, the initial yield of IPO shares is around 20% to 30% on average but it is significantly affected by extreme values with high deviations. The wide variation in the yield of individual public offer shares makes it difficult to predict their stock price. Therefore, this study contributes to investors’ investment decisions by introducing machine learning algorithms to predict the closing price and closing price returns over the initial price of the listing. This study analyzes 38 communications and 1,165 IPO cases in the KOSPI and KOSDAQ from July 2004 to May 2021, provided by Korea Exchange.

Machine learning based anti-cancer drug response prediction and search for predictor genes using cancer cell line gene expression,2021,"['cell line gene expression data', 'drug response prediction', 'machine learning', 'predictor genes']",,"Although many models have been proposed to accurately predict the response of drugs in cell lines recent years, understanding the genome related to drug response is also the key for completing oncology precision medicine. In this paper, based on the cancer cell line gene expression and the drug response data, we established a reliable and accurate drug response prediction model and found predictor genes for some drugs of interest. To this end, we first performed pre-selection of genes based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and then used ElasticNet regression model for drug response prediction and fine gene selection. To find more reliable set of predictor genes, we performed regression twice for each drug, one with IC<sub>50</sub> and the other with area under the curve (AUC) (or activity area). For the 12 drugs we tested, the predictive performance in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient exceeded 0.6 and the highest one was 17-AAG for which Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.811 for IC<sub>50</sub> and 0.81 for AUC. We identify common predictor genes for IC<sub>50</sub> and AUC, with which the performance was similar to those with genes separately found for IC<sub>50</sub> and AUC, but with much smaller number of predictor genes. By using only common predictor genes, the highest performance was AZD6244 (0.8016 for IC<sub>50</sub>, 0.7945 for AUC) with 321 predictor genes."
Machine learning aided rail corrugation monitoring for railway track maintenance,2021,"['rail corrugation', 'dynamic analysis', 'artificial neural network', 'machine learning', 'monitoring', 'maintenance']",,"Urban rail transit is a critical infrastructure system that supports urban economic and social development. It has a significant mass transportation capacity while enables environmental benefits. Public transport is a way to resolve large-scale urban road traffic problems and contributes towards sustainable development. However, with the operations of railway vehicles on curves, unbalanced and undulated wears often appear on rails, especially on the low rail. This rail surface defect, so-called 'rail corrugation', directly affects the service life of rolling stocks and track components. The high-frequency vibrations caused by train-track interaction over rail corrugations also impair passenger ride comfort and generate excessive noises. In severe cases, the defects may even endanger the safe passage of a railway vehicle. In practice, rail corrugation has brought huge challenges to the reliable operations and maintenance of railway networks. With the continuous expansion of railway lines and the increasing traffic demands, any existing rail corrugation test method is not enough to meet the actual needs of track maintainers to promptly identify and mitigate rail surface defects. Therefore, this investigation aims to establish a new technique to prognose and classify rail corrugations efficiently and effectively. This study adopts D-track dynamic simulation package to obtain over thousands of vibration data in the form of axle box accelerations from train-track interactions under different conditions. Neural network models have been developed to recognize the rail corrugations and then classify their severity to aid the planning and prioritization of rail track maintenance activities. The models have been trained and tested using the vibration data, achieving the accuracy of over 90%. The optimal model has then been highlighted. The investigation has demonstrated the potential of the neural network to detect and classify rail corrugations, which can be used practically for curved track condition monitoring and maintenance planning."
Machine Learning Enabled Steady-State Security Predictor as Deployed for Distribution Feeder Reconfiguration,2021,"['Network reconfi guration', 'Machine learning', 'Decision tree']",,"The distribution network is reconfi gured by modifying the topology arrangement of the network feeders. Because the voltage stability of the distribution networks can diff er within a range following network reconfi guration, the calculation of steady-state voltage stability plays a signifi cant role in real-time feeder reconfi guration. Examining the state of security and estimating it for the next operational confi guration is crucial for making real-time decisions. Online security evaluation needs minimal complexity and computing time. Standard methods of assessing the distribution network’s steady-state voltage stability can be insuffi cient for online and real-time environments due to their high complexity and long computing period. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach for classifying confi guration states and adopts the decision tree technique to interpret the online applications in the feeder reconfi guration. For the classifi cation, the single line equivalent L-index voltage stability and switching confi gurations of the feeders are employed as training information for the ML models. A modifi ed IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus test systems verifi es the feasibility of the suggested solution. Once trained, the proposed system provides a quick and accurate classifi cation for unknown confi gurations of the specifi c security state in 0.3 seconds."

In this paper, we aim to improve the predictions of apartment auction winning rates by utilizing algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN, which are robust to problems such as nonlinearity and multicollinearity. A total of 111,232 nationwide apartment auction data were learned and tested from January 2010 to June 2020 by using the data provided by the GG auction and macroeconomic variables collected from KOSIS. In addition, a moving window methodology and an extending window methodology are applied considering by the characteristics of the social science data whose probability structure changes over time. Empirical study shows that the Gradient Boosting models outperforms other models in terms of MAPE, RMSE, MedAE, and AbsMean. There is no significant difference between a moving window methodology and an extended window methodology."

This study evolves the Aging Male Symptoms (AMS) with GA to better identify late onset hypogonadism (LOH) with serum testosterone.Materials and Methods: GA was trained on a training set of standard AMS questionnaire on a nationwide LOH epidemiology study. Random matrices of selectors for particular items were generated. Each generation of was evolved through a fitness function determined by sensitivity. Threshold to determine positive serum testosterone level for LOH was randomized for each competing strategy. After 2,000 runs, with each run producing the best result out of a set of 3,000 randomly generated sets evolved through 300 generations, the best AMS selection matrix was then applied to a separately enrolled validation set to compare outcomes.Results: Predictability for serum testosterone levels dropped markedly above 3.5 ng/mL during pilot training.

Exploration of Machine Learning to Predict Hot Ductility of Cast Steel from Chemical Composition and Thermal Conditions,2021,['Prediction model · Data-driven inverse model · Random forest · Gaussian process · Support vector machine · Neural network · Gaussian fitting'],,"This study explores the use of machine learning (ML) as a data-driven approach to estimate hot ductility of cast steel fromliterature data. Four ML algorithms were used to predict hot ductility by considering elemental composition and thermalconditions. Experimentally-measured reduction of area (RA) values were converted to a low-temperature limit, centertemperature,and high-temperature limit, which were represented as Gaussian curves. The prediction accuracy of the fourML models was evaluated using RMSE for these three output variables. In a case study of three steels that had differentcontents of alloying elements, only the Neural-net model predicted the RA trough more accurately in all cases. These resultsdemonstrate the utility of ML models to predict hot ductility of cast steels."
An optimized machine learning based moment-rotation analysis of steel pallet rack connections,2021,"['connections', 'discrete wavelet transform', 'moment-rotation', 'steel pallet racks', 'support vector machine']",,"The moment-rotation (M-θ) response of steel pallet rack (SPR) beam-to-column connections (BCCs) is naturally complex and predicted through repeated experimental investigations motivated by the variety in the geometry of commercially available beam end connectors (BECs). Past literature has shown that even finite element modeling (FEM) was somehow unable to fully capture the structural behavior of SPR BCCs in the plastic region. This study proposes an innovative Support vector machine (SVM)-Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT)-based optimized model for M-θ analysis of SPR BCCs. A data set of total thirty-two experiments on SPR BCCs was used to develop the model. The experimental investigations identified the most influential parameters affecting the M-θ response of SPR BCCs which are column thickness, beam depth, and depth of the BEC. Those parameters were optimized using Firefly algorithm and selected as input parameters. Reliability assessment of proposed predictive model was performed using root-mean-square error (RMSE), Pearson coefficient (r), and coefficient of determination ‘r-square’ (R2). The findings of predictive model were juxtaposed with experimental outcomes and FEM results, available in the literature, and a close agreement was achieved. The R2 value of 0.958 and 0.984 were achieved for moment and rotation predictions, respectively. Hence, the proposed SVM-DWT model can be efficiently used to forecast the optimum and reliable M-θ response of SPR BCCs and to minimize the need of repetitive testing."

Therefore, in this research work, paddy stubble burnt fields were identified by using fuzzy based machine learning algorithms for a test site in Patiala, Punjab, India. An Euclidean Distance (ED) and Gaussian Kernel based Modified Possibilistic c-Means (MPCM) algorithms were used for this purpose. The main objective of this research work was to test the effectiveness of machine learning approach for identification of paddy stubble burnt filed and also to find out the better classifier amongst Euclidean Distance (ED) and Gaussian Kernel MPCM classifier. The Sentinel 2A/2B cloud free temporal data having a high frequency of repetitiveness in the interval of 5-days were used. To reduce spectral dimensionality of data Class Based Sensor Independent Indices (CBSII) database were generated. The burning was mainly observed from the last week of October to the first week of November and has been visualized using variation of CBSII-NDVI temporal plot. Normalized Burnt Ratio (NBR) was computed and compared with CBSII-NDVI outputs for both the ED and Kernel based MPCM classifiers.Delta Normalized Burnt Ratio (DNBR) was computed for cross-validation of burnt patches and is found to be in between 0.45 and 0.66. Thus, it can be concluded that kernel based MPCM classifiers are more efficient in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise in comparison to distance based MPCM classifiers, for the mapping of paddy burnt fields."
Maximum Power Point Tracking During Partial Shading Effect in PV System Using Machine Learning Regression Controller,2021,['Energy harvesting  · Machine learning algorithm  · Maximum power point tracking  · Microcontroller based system design  · Regression controller'],,"Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm performs for maximizing the effi ciency of solar Photo Voltaic (PV) system. The solar photovoltaic system effi ciency reduces due to partial shading and ambient atmospheric condition, which varies with geographic locations. Traditional MPPT systems solve the above problem through diff erent soft computing algorithms such as Perturb and observe (P&O), Flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO). In P&O, FPA and PSO algorithms, duty cycle of boost converter varies to attain MPPT. The soft computing algorithms in MPPT perform less during the partial shading eff ect or rapid insolation, fl uctuation condition of solar energy. The performance of MPPT with traditional algorithms is reduced due to slow convergence speed and oscillations in tracking by computing algorithms. In this paper, Regression controller based MPPT achieve maximum peak voltage during partial shading eff ect is developed. The regression controller predicts the duty cycle for boost converter based on stored dataset of PV system output voltage and load, during partial shading eff ect or rapid isolation for that particular geographic location. The regression based duty cycle prediction controller is programmed in MATLAB R2018a Simulink. Furthermore, Regression controller is implemented in PV system test bed. The simulation and hardware results of Regression controller based MPPT perform more of about 20%, 16.96% and 15% in effi ciency respectively than PSO, FPA and P&O algorithms during partial shading condition in PV."

Automatic and objective gradation of 114 183 terrorist attacks using a machine learning approach,2021,"['Automatic rank', 'gradation', 'machine learning', 'terrorist attacks']",,"Catastrophic events cause casualties, damage property, and lead to huge social impacts. To build common standards and facilitate international communications regarding disasters, the relevant authorities in social management rank them in subjectively imposed terms such as direct economic losses and loss of life. Terrorist attacks involving uncertain human factors, which are roughly graded based on the rule of property damage, are even more difficult to interpret and assess. In this paper, we collected 114 183 open-source records of terrorist attacks and used a machine learning method to grade them synthetically in an automatic and objective way. No subjective claims or personal preferences were involved in the grading, and each derived common factor contains the comprehensive and rich information of many variables. Our work presents a new automatic ranking approach and is suitable for a broad range of gradation problems. Furthermore, we can use this model to grade all such attacks globally and visualize them to provide new insights."

The dependent variable was preterm birth during 2015–2017 and the independent variables were GERD (coded as no vs. yes) for each of the years 2002–2014, periodontitis (coded as no vs. yes) for each of the years 2002–2014, age (year) in 2014, socioeconomic status in 2014 measured by an insurance fee, and region (city) (coded as no vs. yes) in 2014. Random forest variable importance was adopted for finding main predictors of preterm birth and testing its associations with GERD and periodontitis.Results: Based on random forest variable importance, main predictors of preterm birth during 2015–2017 were socioeconomic status in 2014, age in 2014, GERD for the years 2012, 2014, 2010, 2013, 2007 and 2009, region (city) in 2014 and GERD for the year 2006. The importance rankings of periodontitis were relatively low.Conclusion: Preterm birth has a stronger association with GERD than with periodontitis. For the prevention of preterm birth, preventive measures for GERD would be essential together with the improvement of socioeconomic status for pregnant women. Especially, it would be vital to promote active counseling for general GERD symptoms (neglected by pregnant women)."

As such, tool wear estimation is an essential component of NC milling operations. This study addresses this issue by proposing an extreme learning machine (ELM) method enhanced by a hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (GAPSO) approach for conducting tool wear estimation based on workpiece vibration signals. Here, a few feature parameters in the time, frequency, and time–frequency (Ensemble empirical mode decomposition, EEMD) domains of the workpiece vibration signals are extracted as the input of the ELM model. Then, the initialized weights and thresholds of the ELM model are optimized based on the GAPSO approach with training dataset. Finally, tool wear is estimated using the optimized ELM model with testing dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by its application to vibration signals collected from two milling tool wear experiments (an open-access benchmark dataset and a milling tool wear experiment) by comparison to the ELM, GA-ELM, and PSO-ELM methods. The results indicate that the estimation accuracy and optimization efficiency of the proposed method outperforms that of other three methods."
Using Automated Translating Machine to Encourage Target Vocabulary Learning During COVID-19,2021,"['번역', '번역교육', '코로나 19', '목표 단어', 'Translation', 'Translation education', 'COVID-19', 'Target Vocabulary']",,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has dramatically changed the dynamics of learning environment. Various researches have examined the implications and impacts of such changes and the results were met with mixed findings. Although the learners inevitably preferred face to face interaction and direct communication, under the circumstances they were willing to continue with the current devices if multiple modes of communication devices could be added to the current environment. The paper aimed to utilize the use of Automated Translating Machines (ATM), such as Naver Papago and Google Translator, to learners and to examine whether such devices could further aid the learners under such circumstances. Results showed that the high proficiency group only used the ATMs for reference purposes and such devices did not yield meaningful findings even with certain target vocabularies. However, low proficiency group learners were able to utilize the device to learn certain target vocabularies better than the conventional vocabulary learning method. This shows that ATMs can be utilized with the online-learning to teach certain target vocabularies to the low proficiency group learners."

According to field observations, 741 locations were reported as roe deer's habitat preferences. The dataset were divided with a proportion of 70:30 for constructing models and validation purposes. Through FR model, a total of 10 influential factors were opted for the modelling process, namely altitude, valley depth, slope height, topographic position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference water index, drainage density, road density, radar intensity, and morphological feature. The results of variable importance analysis determined that TPI, TWI, altitude and valley depth have higher impact on predicting. Furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to assess the prediction accuracies of three models. The results showed that all the models almost have similar performances, but LSTM model had relatively higher prediction ability in comparison to FR and CNN models with the accuracy of 76% and 73% during the training and validation process.

We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words.

Based on the clustering pattern of the reconstructed phylogenetic tree, the dataset was divided into three groups: mammalian, avian, and fsh. We then used random forest (RF), naïve Bayes (NB), and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithms for host classifcation.Results Among the three algorithms, classifcation accuracy using kNN was highest in both LT-Ag (ACC=98.83) and VP1 (ACC=96.51). The amino acid physicochemical property most strongly correlated with host classifcation was charge, followed by solvent accessibility, polarity, and hydrophobicity in LT-Ag. However, in VP1, amino acid composition showed the highest correlation with host classifcation, followed by charge, normalized van der Waals volume, and solvent accessibility.Conclusions The results of the present study suggest the possibility of determining or predicting the host range and infection properties of PyVs at the molecular level by identifying the host species of active and emerging PyVs that exhibit diferent infection properties among diverse host species. Structural and biochemical diferences of LT-Ag and VP1 proteins in host species that refect these amino acid properties can be considered primary factors that determine the host specifcity of PyV."
Study of Battery State-of-charge Estimation with kNN Machine Learning Method,2021,"['Electrical vehicle', 'Battery characteristics', 'State of charge', 'Depth of discharge', 'Machine learning algorithms and kNN method']",,"Electric vehicles have high demand due to their ecofriendly nature. From this point of view, lithium batteries have gained high attention in recent days due to their high efficiency and long life time. Hence, it is of the utmost importance to evaluate the battery characteristics, such as the state of charge (SOC), depth of discharge (DOD), and remaining life of a battery to ensure battery safety. These parameters were derived in order to estimate the battery life time before degradation. This estimation is very much required in making a decision about battery usage in the future. In this study, the SOC of a lithium polymer battery was evaluated in a real-time experiment. Charging and discharging cycles were done, and we obtained the voltage, current, and time data from the experimental result. This experimental data trained machine learning methods such as the kNN (k Nearest Neighbor) method to estimate the SOC more precisely. After training the model, a test was done. The proposed estimator was calibrated by experimental data. The results are satisfactory with accuracy of 98% and mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 0.74[%]."

The program proposed detects botnet attacks using the newest CSE-CIC-IDS2018 cyber dataset published by the Canadian Cybersecurity Establishment (CIC). The cyber dataset can be accessed on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The realistic network dataset consists of all the modern and existing attacks such as Brute-force attacks and password cracking, Heartbleed, Botnet, DoS (Denial of Service), DDoS also known as Distributed Denial of Service, Web attacks i.e. vulnerable web app attacks, and infiltration of the network from inside. The objective of the proposed research is to identify a classification of Botnet attacks. Botnet attack is a Trojan Horse malware attack that poses a serious security threat to the banking and financial sectors. Since a specific classifier could possibly work for such datasets it is crucial to finish a comparative examination of classifiers in order to achieve the most noteworthy execution in such basic detection of network attacks. The proposed framework is to incorporate different classifier methods such as KNearset Neighbor classifier, Naïve Bayes, Adaboost with Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine classifier, Random Forest classifier, and Artificial Intelligence to distinguish a portrayal of botnet attacks on the recent and realistic cyber dataset CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The results of the classification are given as precise precision for the specific classifiers. And furthermore, the proposed framework uses the Calibration curve as a standard approach in analytical methods which generates reliability diagrams to check the predicted probabilities of various classifiers are well-calibrated or not. Finally, the displayed graph proves how well the artificial intelligence technique outperforms all other classifiers which generates reliability diagrams to check the predicted probabilities of various classifiers are well-calibrated or not."

Automated Prediction of Ischemic Brain Tissue Fate from Multiphase Computed Tomographic Angiography in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke Using Machine Learning,2021,"['Ischemic stroke', 'Multiphase computed tomography angiography', 'Cerebral infarction', 'Perfusion', 'Machine learning']",,"Background and Purpose Multiphase computed tomographic angiography (mCTA) provides time variant images of pial vasculature supplying brain in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). To develop a machine learning (ML) technique to predict tissue perfusion and infarction from mCTA source images.Methods 284 patients with AIS were included from the Precise and Rapid assessment of collaterals using multi-phase CTA in the triage of patients with acute ischemic stroke for Intra-artery Therapy (Prove-IT) study. All patients had non-contrast computed tomography, mCTA, and computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) at baseline and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging/noncontrast- enhanced computed tomography. Of the 284 patient images, 140 patient images were randomly selected to train and validate three ML models to predict a pre-defined Tmax thresholded perfusion abnormality, core and penumbra on CTP. The remaining 144 patient images were used to test the ML models. The predicted perfusion, core and penumbra lesions from ML models were compared to CTP perfusion lesion and to follow-up infarct using Bland-Altman plots, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and Dice similarity coefficient.Results Mean difference between the mCTA predicted perfusion volume and CTP perfusion volume was 4.6 mL (limit of agreement [LoA], –53 to 62.1 mL; P=0.56; CCC 0.63 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.71; P<0.01], ICC 0.68 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.78; P<0.001]). Mean difference between the mCTA predicted infarct and follow-up infarct in the 100 patients with acute reperfusion (modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction [mTICI] 2b/2c/3) was 21.7 mL, while it was 3.4 mL in the 44 patients not achieving reperfusion (mTICI 0/1). Amongst reperfused subjects, CCC was 0.4 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.55; P<0.01) and ICC was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.50; P<0.01); in non-reperfused subjects CCC was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.60; P<0.001) and ICC was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.76; P<0.001). No difference was observed between the mCTA and CTP predicted infarct volume in the test cohort (P=0.67).Conclusions A ML based mCTA model is able to predict brain tissue perfusion abnormality and follow-up infarction, comparable to CTP."
Performance of Prediction Models for Diagnosing Severe Aortic Stenosis Based on Aortic Valve Calcium on Cardiac Computed Tomography: Incorporation of Radiomics and Machine Learning,2021,"['Aortic valve calcium', 'Aortic stenosis', 'Computed tomography', 'Radiomics', 'Machine learning']",,"Objective: We aimed to develop a prediction model for diagnosing severe aortic stenosis (AS) using computed tomography (CT) radiomics features of aortic valve calcium (AVC) and machine learning (ML) algorithms.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 408 patients who underwent cardiac CT between March 2010 and August 2017 and had echocardiographic examinations (240 patients with severe AS on echocardiography [the severe AS group] and 168 patients without severe AS [the non-severe AS group]). Data were divided into a training set (312 patients) and a validation set (96 patients). Using non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CT scans, AVC was segmented, and 128 radiomics features for AVC were extracted. After feature selection was performed with three ML algorithms (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO], random forests [RFs], and eXtreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost]), model classifiers for diagnosing severe AS on echocardiography were developed in combination with three different model classifier methods (logistic regression, RF, and XGBoost). The performance (c-index) of each radiomics prediction model was compared with predictions based on AVC volume and score.Results: The radiomics scores derived from LASSO were significantly different between the severe AS and non-severe AS groups in the validation set (median, 1.563 vs. 0.197, respectively, p < 0.001). A radiomics prediction model based on feature selection by LASSO + model classifier by XGBoost showed the highest c-index of 0.921 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.869– 0.973) in the validation set. Compared to prediction models based on AVC volume and score (c-indexes of 0.894 [95% CI, 0.815– 0.948] and 0.899 [95% CI, 0.820–0.951], respectively), eight and three of the nine radiomics prediction models showed higher discrimination abilities for severe AS. However, the differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05 for all).Conclusion: Models based on the radiomics features of AVC and ML algorithms may perform well for diagnosing severe AS, but the added value compared to AVC volume and score should be investigated further."
In-plane and out-of-plane bending moments and local stresses in mooring chain links using machine learning technique,2021,"['Tension angle', 'Interlink angle', 'OPB/IPB moment', 'Multi-link analysis', 'Three-link analysis']",,"This paper proposes an efficient approach based on a machine learning technique to predict the local stresses on mooring chain links. Three-link and multi-link finite element analyses were conducted for a target chain link of D107 with steel grade R4; 24,000 and 8000 analyses were performed, respectively.Two serial Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models based on a deep multi-layer perceptron technique were developed. The first ANN model corresponds to multi-link analyses, where the input neurons were the tension force and angle and the output neurons were the interlink angles. The second ANN model corresponds to the three-link analyses with the input neurons of the tension force, interlink angle, and the local stress positions, and the output neurons of the local stress. The predicted local stresses for the untrained cases were reliable compared to the numerical simulation results."
Multi-disciplinary Optimization of Wing Sandwich Structure using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Automatic Machine Learning,2021,"['Multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO)', 'Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)', 'Radial basis function (RBF)', 'Automated machine learning (AutoML)']",,"The coupling between different disciplines for multi-disciplinary optimization greatly increases the complexity of a computational framework, while at the same time increasing CPU time and memory usage. To overcome these difficulties, first, proper orthogonal decomposition and radial basis function were used to generate a reduced-order model from the initial experimental points. Second, analysis results for additional experimental points were predicted using the reduced-order model. Third, using automated machine learning, surrogate models for the objective and constraint functions were obtained from the analysis results at the initial and additional experimental points. Last, optimization was performed using the surrogate models for the objective and constraint functions. As an example, the multi-disciplinary optimization problem of determining the thicknesses of the composite lamina and sandwich core when the composite sandwich structure was used as an aircraft wing skin material was analyzed."

It provides dynamic semantics automatically to include additional concepts using machine learning technique. Compared to the existing ontology, the proposed model reduces query response time and memory consumption to some extent."
Development of Urban Mine Recycling Technology by Machine Learning,2021,,,"The field of recycling for waste electronic components, which is the typical example of an urban mine, requires the development of useful sorting techniques. In this study, a sorter based on image identification by deep learning was developed to select electronic components into four groups. They were recovered from waste printed circuit boards and should be separated to depend on the difference after treatment. The sorter consists of a workstation with GPU, camera, belt conveyor, air compressor. A small piece (less than 3.5 cm) of electronic components on the belt conveyor (belt speed: 6 cm/s) was taken and learned as teaching data. The accuracy of the image identification was 96% as kinds and 99% as groups. The optimum condition of sorting was determined by evaluating accuracies of image identification and recovery rates by blowdown when changing the operating condition such as belt speed and blowdown time of compressed air. Under the optimum condition, the accuracy of image classification in groups was 98.7%. The sorting rate was more than 70%."

EMG Based Control of Transhumeral Prosthesis Using Machine Learning Algorithms,2021,"['k-nearest neighbors', 'myo armband', 'prosthetic arm', 'real-time classification', 'surface electromyography', 'transhumeral amputation']",,"This research presents work on control of a prosthetic arm using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals acquired from triceps and biceps of fifteen healthy and four amputated subjects. Myo armband was used to acquire sEMG signals corresponding to four different arm motions: elbow extension, elbow flexion, wrist pronation, and wrist supination. Ten time-domain features were extracted and considered for classification to recognize thefour-arm motions. These features and their various combinations were used to train four different classifiers, in both offline and real-time settings. It was found that the combination of signal mean and waveform length as a feature and k-nearest neighbors as classifier performed significantly better (p < 0.05) than all other combinations in both offline and real-time settings. The offline accuracies of 95.8% and 68.1% and real-time accuracies of 91.9% and 60.1% were obtained for healthy and amputated subjects, respectively. Results obtained using the presented scheme successfully demonstrate that using suitable features and classifier, classification accuracies can be significantly improved for transhumeral prosthesis, thereby, providing better, wearable and non-invasive control of prostheses using sEMG signals."

Machine learnings for CVD graphene analysis: From measurement to simulation of SEM images,2021,"['System modeling', 'CVD graphene growth', 'Machine learning', 'SEM prediction']",,"In this study, we introduce an approach that applies machine learning (ML) in various procedures topredict graphene growth pattern in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. Atfirst, CVD experimentswere conducted to synthesize graphene using CH4 as a precursor on a Cu substrate at high temperatures,to get experimental data for training those models. Then, the size, coverage, domain density, and aspectratio of graphene, which vary depending on the synthesis conditions, were measured and analyzedautomatically by developing a region proposal convolutional neural network (R-CNN). Subsequently, anartificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM) were used to develop surrogatemodels to deduce the correlation between CVD process variables and the measured specifications.Characteristic graphene grains with hexagonal morphology were created using a generative adversarialnetwork (GAN) to imitate the CVD growth. Then, they were modified to have the same size and aspectratio as the predicted values and placed to meet the predicted coverage and domain density. Finally, thepre-generated images were modified using Pix2pix to obtain the same outlook as the experimental SEMimages. As a result, it was possible to simulate graphene synthesis under various CVD condition. Throughnumerous simulations in advance, we were able to identify the experiment condition to synthesizegraphene with the desired morphologies of large grain size and low domain density. Developing aplatform to predict a CVD system for the controlled synthesis of graphene allow us to synthesize thegraphene with high efficiency, saving tremendous amounts of time and expenses."

In an attempt to solve this, a model of a deep learning-based intrusion detection system that analyzes the pattern of intelligent attacks through data learning has emerged. Intrusion detection systems are divided into host-based and network-based depending on the installation location. Unlike network-based intrusion detection systems, host-based intrusion detection systems have the disadvantage of having to observe the inside and outside of the system as a whole. However, it has the advantage of being able to detect intrusions that cannot be detected by a network-based intrusion detection system. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a study on a host-based intrusion detection system. In order to evaluate and improve the performance of the host-based intrusion detection system model, we used the host-based Leipzig Intrusion Detection-Data Set (LID-DS) published in 2018. In the performance evaluation of the model using that data set, in order to confirm the similarity of each data and reconstructed to identify whether it is normal data or abnormal data, 1D vector data is converted to 3D image data. Also, the deep learning model has the drawback of having to re-learn every time a new cyber attack method is seen. In other words, it is not efficient because it takes a long time to learn a large amount of data. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN) to use the Few-Shot Learning method that shows excellent performance by learning the little amount of data. Siamese-CNN determines whether the attacks are of the same type by the similarity score of each sample of cyber attacks converted into images. The accuracy was calculated using Few-Shot Learning technique, and the performance of Vanilla Convolutional Neural Network (Vanilla-CNN) and Siamese-CNN was compared to confirm the performance of Siamese-CNN. As a result of measuring Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score index, it was confirmed that the recall of the Siamese-CNN model proposed in this study was increased by about 6% from the Vanilla-CNN model."

After dividing the testing area into 1 m square grids, eight factors were derived through field and laboratory experiments. The factor of safety was calculated based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory. Finally, the input and output values of deep learning were obtained. Bayesian regularization was applied among gradient descents to improve the learning efficiency when applying machine learning.

Is c-command Machine-learnable?,2021,"['c-command', 'deep learning', 'BERT', 'surprisal', 'NPI', 'reflexive anaphor']",,"Many psycholinguistic studies have tested whether pronouns and polarity items elicit additional processing cost when they are not c-commanded. The previous studies claim that the c-command constraint regulates the distribution of relevant syntactic objects. As such, the syntactic effects of the c-command relation are greatly affected by the types of licensing (e.g. quantificational binding) and reading comprehension patterns of subjects (e.g. linguistic illusion). The present study investigates the reading behavior of the language model BERT when the syntactic processing of relational information (i.e. X c-commands Y) is required. Specifically, our two experiments contrasted the BERT comprehension of a c-commanding licensor versus a non-c-commanding licensor with reflexive anaphora and negative polarity items. The analysis based on the information-theoretic measure of surprisal suggests that violations of the c-command constraint are unexpected for BERT representations. We conclude that deep learning models like BERT can learn the syntactic c-command restriction at least with respect to reflexive anaphors and negative polarity items. At the same time, BERT appeared to have some limitations in its flexibility to apply compensatory pragmatic reasoning when a non-c-commanding licensor intruded in the dependency structure."

These technologies also raise alarm bells in people and rightfully so, considering the leaps made in favour of capitalism which relies on these technologies for surveillance. In such times, the question of surveillance capitalism and artificial learning is as much about the ontological nature of machine-human relations as much as it is about the social organization of relations between them. This paper will investigate the danger of isolating the uses of artificial intelligence-as-technological-mystification from the political system it is governed within. It also points at the dangers of substituting politics with a policy-driven approach to mitigate the effects of capitalist corruption of human and technological potentialities. Finally the paper discusses the need for reimagining equality beyond the frame of data-privacy as a defense against a seemingly engulfing technological bio-capitalism."
Is it possible to forecast KOSPI direction using deep learning methods?,2021,"['deep learning', 'machine learning', 'time-series data', '1D-CNN', 'LSTM']",,"Deep learning methods have been developed, used in various fields, and they have shown outstanding performances in many cases. Many studies predicted a daily stock return, a classic example of time-series data, using deep learning methods. We also tried to apply deep learning methods to Korea's stock market data. We used Korea's stock market index (KOSPI) and several individual stocks to forecast daily returns and directions. We compared several deep learning models with other machine learning methods, including random forest and XGBoost. In regression, long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models are better than other prediction models. For the classification applications, there is no clear winner. However, even the best deep learning models cannot predict significantly better than the simple base model. We believe that it is challenging to predict daily stock return data even if we use the latest deep learning methods."

We are particularly interested in developing a Deep-Learning model that can outperform conventional machine learning classification performance. A total of 13 activities based on the laboratory experiments' data are used for the initial performance comparison. We have improved classification performance using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with an auto-encoder feature reduction and parameter tuning. With various publically available HAR datasets, we could also achieve significant improvement in HAR classification. Our CNN model is also compared against Recurrent-Neural-Network(RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) to demonstrate its superiority. Noticeably, our model could distinguish both general activities and near-identical activities such as sitting down on the chair and floor, with almost perfect classification accuracy."
Multi Label Deep Learning classification approach for False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grid,2021,"['Deep learning', 'False Data Injection Attack', 'Internet of Things', 'Machine learning', 'Multi-label Classification', 'Power System', 'Smart grid']",,"The smart grid replaces the traditional power structure with information inventiveness that contributes to a new physical structure. In such a field, malicious information injection can potentially lead to extreme results. Incorrect, FDI attacks will never be identified by typical residual techniques for false data identification. Most of the work on the detection of FDI attacks is based on the linearized power system model DC and does not detect attacks from the AC model. Also, the overwhelming majority of current FDIA recognition approaches focus on FDIA, whilst significant injection location data cannot be achieved. Building on the continuous developments in deep learning, we propose a Deep Learning based Locational Detection technique to continuously recognize the specific areas of FDIA. In the development area solver gap happiness is a False Data Detector (FDD) that incorporates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The FDD is established enough to catch the fake information. As a multi-label classifier, the following CNN is utilized to evaluate the irregularity and cooccurrence dependency of power flow calculations due to the possible attacks. There are no earlier statistical assumptions in the architecture proposed, as they are model-free. It is also cost-accommodating since it does not alter the current FDD framework and it is only several microseconds on a household computer during the identification procedure. We have shown that ANN-MLP, SVM-RBF, and CNN can conduct locational detection under different noise and attack circumstances through broad experience in IEEE 14, 30, 57, and 118 bus systems. Moreover, the multi-name classification method used successfully improves the precision of the present identification."

In particular, we consider the components of Chinese characters as the basic unit and consider the pronunciation prediction as a machine translation procedure (the component sequence as a source sentence, the pronunciation, pinyin, as a target sentence). In addition to traditional features such as the bidirectional word translation and the n-gram language model, we also implement a component similarity feature to overcome some typos during practical use. We incorporate these features into a log-linear model. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms other baseline models."
Characteristics of Eight Korean EFL Young Adults’ L2 Writing Using Machine Translation Programs,2021,"['English writing', 'Google Translate', 'Papago', 'machine translation', 'writing process', 'EFL young adults']",,"Since artificial neural networks were applied to machine translation (MT) programs such as Google Translate and Papago, their quality of translation has improved dramatically. It leads to the consideration of MT as a pedagogical tool for teaching and learning English. In this regard, this study observed and analyzed eight Korean EFL young adults’ English writing processes using Google Translate and Papago in real-time. To explore when and how they exploited MT in completing a narrative essay, a qualitative method using screen recordings of writing sessions and retrospective interviews was implemented. The findings revealed three most representative instances among many others that the participants utilized MT to resolve difficulties in English. Moreover, those instances are closely related to self-judgment the writers constantly made. Self-judgment is an inevitable process for the writers to incorporate MT output in their writing. In the process of self-judgment, English abilities and knowledge the writers possess might play significant roles to accept appropriate MT outputs. The results of the present study also indicate that the participants, albeit a small number, preferred Papago over Google Translate based on their assumptions in accuracy and usefulness. Finally, some implications and limitations drawn from these results were also discussed."

The scheme employs a prioritized learning automata technique to improve the throughput performance by minimizing the level of interaction and collision of M2M devices with human-to-human devices sharing the RACH of a cellular system. In addition, this scheme eliminates the excessive punishment suffered by the M2M devices by controlling the administration of a penalty. Simulation results show that the proposed PLA-QL-RACH scheme improves the RACH throughput by approximately 82% and reduces access delay by 79% with faster learning convergence when compared with QL-RACH."
Effectiveness of Transfer Learning for Deep Learning-Based Electrocardiogram Analysis,2021,"['Electrocardiography', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Arrhythmia', 'Classification']",,"Objectives: Many deep learning-based predictive models evaluate the waveforms of electrocardiograms (ECGs). Becausedeep learning-based models are data-driven, large and labeled biosignal datasets are required. Most individual researchersfind it difficult to collect adequate training data. We suggest that transfer learning can be used to solve this problem and increasethe effectiveness of biosignal analysis. Methods: We applied the weights of a pretrained model to another model thatperformed a different task (i.e., transfer learning). We used 2,648,100 unlabeled 8.2-second-long samples of ECG II data topretrain a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and employed the CAE to classify 12 ECG rhythms within a dataset, which had10,646 10-second-long 12-lead ECGs with 11 rhythm labels. We split the datasets into training and test datasets in an 8:2 ratio.To confirm that transfer learning was effective, we evaluated the performance of the classifier after the proposed transferlearning, random initialization, and two-dimensional transfer learning as the size of the training dataset was reduced. Allexperiments were repeated 10 times using a bootstrapping method. The CAE performance was evaluated by calculating themean squared errors (MSEs) and that of the ECG rhythm classifier by deriving F1-scores. Results: The MSE of the CAE was626.583. The mean F1-scores of the classifiers after bootstrapping of 100%, 50%, and 25% of the training dataset were 0.857,0.843, and 0.835, respectively, when the proposed transfer learning was applied and 0.843, 0.831, and 0.543, respectively, afterrandom initialization was applied. Conclusions: Transfer learning effectively overcomes the data shortages that can compromiseECG domain analysis by deep learning."
Deep Learning Frameworks for Cervical Mobilization Based on Website Images,2021,"['Mobilization', 'Medical images']",,"Background: Deep learning related research works on website medical images have been actively conducted in the field of health care, however, articles related to the musculoskeletal system have been introduced insufficiently, deep learning-based studies on classifying orthopedic manual therapy images would also just be entered. Objectives: To create a deep learning model that categorizes cervical mobilization images and establish a web application to find out its clinical utility. Design: Research and development. Methods: Three types of cervical mobilization images (central posteroanterior (CPA) mobilization, unilateral posteroanterior (UPA) mobilization, and anteroposterior (AP) mobilization) were obtained using functions of 'Download All Images' and a web crawler. Unnecessary images were filtered from 'Auslogics Duplicate File Finder' to obtain the final 144 data (CPA=62, UPA=46, AP=36). Training classified into 3 classes was conducted in Teachable Machine. The next procedures, the trained model source was uploaded to the web application cloud integrated development environment (https://ide.goorm.io/) and the frame was built. The trained model was tested in three environments: Teachable Machine File Upload (TMFU), Teachable Machine Webcam (TMW), and Web Service webcam (WSW). Results: In three environments (TMFU, TMW, WSW), the accuracy of CPA mobilization images was 81-96%. The accuracy of the UPA mobilization image was 43~94%, and the accuracy deviation was greater than that of CPA. The accuracy of the AP mobilization image was 65-75%, and the deviation was not large compared to the other groups. In the three environments, the average accuracy of CPA was 92%, and the accuracy of UPA and AP was similar up to 70%. Conclusion: This study suggests that training of images of orthopedic manual therapy using machine learning open software is possible, and that web applications made using this training model can be used clinically."

Recent use of deep learning techniques in clinical applications based on gait: a survey,2021,"['gait abnormality', 'gait disorders', 'gait analysis', 'deep learning', 'clinical applications']",,"Gait analysis has been studied for a long time and applied to fields such as security, sport, and medicine. In particular, clinical gait analysis has played a significant role in improving the quality of healthcare. With the growth of machine learning technology in recent years, deep learning-based approaches to gait analysis have become popular. However, a large number of samples are required for training models when using deep learning, where the amount of available gait-related data may be limited for several reasons. This paper discusses certain techniques that can be applied to enable the use of deep learning for gait analysis in case of limited availability of data. Recent studies on the clinical applications of deep learning for gait analysis are also reviewed, and the compatibility between these applications and sensing modalities is determined.

A fully deep learning model for the automatic identification of cephalometric landmarks,2021,"['Anatomic Landmarks', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Dental Digital Radiography', 'Deep Learning', 'Neural Network Models']",,"Purpose: This study aimed to propose a fully automatic landmark identification model based on a deep learning algorithm using real clinical data and to verify its accuracy considering inter-examiner variability. Materials and Methods: In total, 950 lateral cephalometric images from Yonsei Dental Hospital were used. Two calibrated examiners manually identified the 13 most important landmarks to set as references. The proposed deep learning model has a 2-step structure-a region of interest machine and a detection machine-each consisting of 8 convolution layers, 5 pooling layers, and 2 fully connected layers. The distance errors of detection between 2 examiners were used as a clinically acceptable range for performance evaluation. Results: The 13 landmarks were automatically detected using the proposed model. Inter-examiner agreement for all landmarks indicated excellent reliability based on the 95% confidence interval. The average clinically acceptable range for all 13 landmarks was 1.24 mm. The mean radial error between the reference values assigned by 1 expert and the proposed model was 1.84 mm, exhibiting a successful detection rate of 36.1%. The A-point, the incisal tip of the maxillary and mandibular incisors, and ANS showed lower mean radial error than the calibrated expert variability. Conclusion: This experiment demonstrated that the proposed deep learning model can perform fully automatic identification of cephalometric landmarks and achieve better results than examiners for some landmarks. It is meaningful to consider between-examiner variability for clinical applicability when evaluating the performance of deep learning methods in cephalometric landmark identification."
Effective Electricity Demand Prediction via Deep Learning,2021,"['LSTM', 'CNN', 'Electricity demand prediction', 'Deep-learning', 'Machine-learning', 'ARIMA', 'MLP']",,"Prediction of electricity demand in homes and buildings can be used to optimize an energy management system by decreasing energy wastage. A time-series prediction system is still a challenging problem in machine learning and deep learning. Our main idea is to compare three methods. For this work, we analyzed an electricity demand prediction system using the current state-of-the-art deep-learning methods with a machine-learning method: error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed structure named CNN-LSTM. For this, we measured and collected electricity demand data in Germany for home appliances. We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental result indicates that CNN-LSTM outperforms eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy."
Damage detection in structures using modal curvatures gapped smoothing method and deep learning,2021,"['damage detections', 'vibration-based', 'gapped smoothing method (GSM)', 'machine learning', 'deep learning', 'convolutional neural network', 'Finite Element Method (FEM)']",,"This paper deals with damage detection using a Gapped Smoothing Method (GSM) combined with deep learning. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a model of deep learning. CNN has an input layer, an output layer, and a number of hidden layers that consist of convolutional layers. The input layer is a tensor with shape (number of images) × (image width) × (image height) × (image depth). An activation function is applied each time to this tensor passing through a hidden layer and the last layer is the fully connected layer. After the fully connected layer, the output layer, which is the final layer, is predicted by CNN. In this paper, a complete machine learning system is introduced. The training data was taken from a Finite Element (FE) model. The input images are the contour plots of curvature gapped smooth damage index. A free-free beam is used as a case study. In the first step, the FE model of the beam was used to generate data. The collected data were then divided into two parts, i.e. 70% for training and 30% for validation. In the second step, the proposed CNN was trained using training data and then validated using available data. Furthermore, a vibration experiment on steel damaged beam in free-free support condition was carried out in the laboratory to test the method. A total number of 15 accelerometers were set up to measure the mode shapes and calculate the curvature gapped smooth of the damaged beam. Two scenarios were introduced with different severities of the damage. The results showed that the trained CNN was successful in detecting the location as well as the severity of the damage in the experimental damaged beam."
Effective End-to-End Deep Learning Process in Medical Imaging Using Independent Task Learning: Application for Diagnosis of Maxillary Sinusitis,2021,"['Machine learning', 'deep learning', 'artificial intelligence', 'neural networks', 'computer', 'sinusitis']",,"Purpose: This study aimed to propose an effective end-to-end process in medical imaging using an independent task learning (ITL) algorithm and to evaluate its performance in maxillary sinusitis applications.Materials and Methods: For the internal dataset, 2122 Waters’ view X-ray images, which included 1376 normal and 746 sinusitis images, were divided into training (n=1824) and test (n=298) datasets. For external validation, 700 images, including 379 normal and 321 sinusitis images, from three different institutions were evaluated. To develop the automatic diagnosis system algorithm, four processing steps were performed: 1) preprocessing for ITL, 2) facial patch detection, 3) maxillary sinusitis detection, and 4) a localization report with the sinusitis detector.Results: The accuracy of facial patch detection, which was the first step in the end-to-end algorithm, was 100%, 100%, 99.5%, and 97.5% for the internal set and external validation sets #1, #2, and #3, respectively.

Deep Learning with Data Augmentation to Add Data Around Classification Boundaries,2021,"['Image Classification', 'Data Augmentation', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Generative Adversarial Networks']",,"Data augmentation methods are used as a technique to improve generalization by increasing the number of training data in image classification. However, most of these methods are not a data driven algorithm, the degree of improvement of generalization ability by performing these data augmentation methods differs between the domains of image data for training. Generative models are researched to use for augmenting data recently. In particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) that can generate clean image get attention as an excellent innovation in machine learning. As GANs extension method, there is a method called CGANs (Mirza and Osindero, 2014) that can be used for data augmentation. When enough training data for each class are not prepared for classification model, the same is true for training CGANs. In such case, CGAN generates noisy images. This makes a classification model to underfit to the original training data. Moreover, when a CGAN approximates the training data distribution, the CGAN generates new training data in the same region where training data densely exist. In such case, augmented data can’t reduce overfitting on the original training data. Therefore, our research contributes to augment data which meets these two requirements. In this study, we propose a method to generate data by the class specific GAN with small training data and selectively add generated data to the training data set that improves classification accuracy by using the entropy of the classification model. The feature of the proposed method is that it focuses on the positional relationship between data and the classification hyperplane in deep learning. In the proposed method, the entropy of the classification model is used to measure the positional relationship between the classification boundary and the data. As a result, the generalization performance is improved by adding the data around the classification boundary as new training data."
Supervised learning에 기반한 돼지 발성음 분류에 관한 연구,2021,"['Pig', 'Sound', 'Classification', 'Analysis', 'Situation judgment', 'Supervised learning']",,"This study categorizes the current situation of the pig as supervised learning through the analysis of the pig’s sound. Audio data were obtained from video data obtained by recording at a barn. Speech data was preprocessed to extract features in the time domain and frequency domain, and formants and MFCC were extracted in the frequency domain. Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine were used for classification, and linear and RBF kernels were used for SVM. The experiment was conducted two times: classifying using features used in Praat and MDVP, which are speech analysis programs, and classifying using MFCC used in speech recognition. After classification, k-fold verification was performed. As a result of the experiment, it can be seen that there is a difference in classification according to the characteristics of using the same voice, and in the case of a situation in which the sound is unified, such as ‘cough,’ the judgment of any classifier is clear. However, in other situations, it is considered necessary to consider the characteristics of pigs by further observing their socialization behavior."
Predicting numeric ratings for Google apps using text features and ensemble learning,2021,"['data mining', 'ensemble learning', 'Google app rating', 'opinion mining', 'text features', 'text mining']",,"Application (app) ratings are feedback provided voluntarily by users and serve as important evaluation criteria for apps. However, these ratings can often be biased owing to insufficient or missing votes. Additionally, significant differences have been observed between numeric ratings and user reviews. This study aims to predict the numeric ratings of Google apps using machine learning classifiers. It exploits numeric app ratings provided by users as training data and returns authentic mobile app ratings by analyzing user reviews. An ensemble learning model is proposed for this purpose that considers term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF) features. Three TF/IDF features, including unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, were used. The dataset was scraped from the Google Play store, extracting data from 14 different app categories. Biased and unbiased user ratings were discriminated using TextBlob analysis to formulate the ground truth, from which the classifier prediction accuracy was then evaluated. The results demonstrate the high potential for machine learning-based classifiers to predict authentic numeric ratings based on actual user reviews."
Distributed optimization and statistical learning for large-scale penalized expectile regression,2021,"['Distributed optimization', 'Expectile regression', 'SCAD', 'Adaptive LASSO', 'Modifed ADMM algorithm']",,"Large-scale data from various research felds are not only heterogeneous and sparse but also difcult to store on a single machine. Expectile regression is a popular alternative for modeling heterogeneous data. In this paper, we devise a distributed optimization approach to SCAD and adaptive LASSO penalized expectile regression, where the observations are randomly partitioned across multiple machines. We construct a penalized communication-efcient surrogate loss (CSL) function. Computationally, our method based on the CSL function requires only the master machine to solve a regular M-estimation problem, while other worker machines compute the gradient of the loss function on local data. Our method matches the estimation error bound of the centralized method during consecutive rounds of communication.Under some mild assumptions, we establish the oracle properties of the SCAD and adaptive LASSO penalized expectile regression. We then develop a modifed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for the implementation of the proposed estimator. A series of simulation studies are conducted to assess the fnite-sample performance of the proposed estimator. Applications to an HIV study demonstrate the practicability of the proposed method."
Utilization of a deep learning-based fuel consumption model in choosing a liner shipping route for container ships in Asia,2021,"['Asymmetric traveling salesman problem', 'Ship fuel consumption model', 'Liner shipping', 'Route choice optimization', 'Deep-learning neural network', 'Container ships']",,"Designating the ideal shipping route can spare expenses, enlarge profits and improve the competitiveness of shipping companies. Liner shipping route choice is mainly contingent on fuel cost, which always contributes the major proportion of the ship’s operating cost. Although many studies on this topic have been carried out, none are based on the fuel consumption forecast model designed by the advanced machine learning method. This paper provides a platform idea for selecting the optimal operating route for container ships to minimize fuel cost by using an asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP) algorithm solution, in which the fuel consumption model for the route is estimated based on the deepmachine learning method. Five input variables are given in the model including average velocity, sailing time, ship’s capacity, wind speed, and wind direction. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the model is 5.89%, indicating that the predictive result obtains a very high accuracy, close to 95%. The optimal model is thus applied in combination with ATSP to address the optimal solution for a certain route."
작업 자세 평가를 위한 Vector-based 및 Deep Learning-based OWAS 평가 시스템 개발,2021,"['OWAS', 'Musculoskeletal disorders', 'Ergonomic risk assessment', 'Deep learning']",,"Objective: This study was intended to develop two risk assessment systems that can evaluate OWAS scores and action level with good accuracy and reliability to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs).Background: Since risk assessment methods such as OWAS and REBA are relied on visual observations, their accuracy and reliability might have been in questions. Therefore, computer-aided risk assessment systems are necessary to enhance accuracy and reliability as well as to improve applicability in workplaces.Method: This study developed vector-based OWAS (V-OWAS) and deep learning-based OWAS (DL-OWAS). V-OWAS (partial automation) asks a user to manually identify the key joint positions from a working picture and automatically calculates OWAS scores and action level. DL-OWAS (high automation) automatically identifies the key positions and determines OWAS scores and action level. To evaluate the performance of the two systems, we used 40 working pictures and compared the results of the two systems with the results of four ergonomic experts with over 10-year experience who did assess based on traditional visual observations.Results: The two systems showed similar assessment results with those obtained from the ergonomic experts. The agreement percentage of V-OWAS (91.3%) with the experts was slightly better than DL-OWAS (90%). On the other hand, the usability score of DL-OWAS (7 out of 7 point Likert scale) was significantly higher than V-OWAS (5.75) and traditional visual observation (5.25).Conclusion: V-OWAS had an advantage in accuracy of identifying the key joint positions; but it required more time and efforts over DL-OWAS. DL-OWAS can assess automatically; but its accuracy might be low if some parts of the body are obscured due to some reasons (e.g., obscured by some machine). Therefore, it is recommended to use V-OWAS or DL-OWAS according to the condition of working picture.Application: The two OWAS systems developed in this study can help industrial practitioners effectively and efficiently assess working posture for preventing WMSDs."
A Sentiment Analysis of Mens and Womens Speech: Dictionary-based vs. Deep-learning-based Analysis,2021,"['BNC64', 'sentiment analysis', 'dictionary-based', 'GRU', 'BERT']",,"It is well known that the language women use is different from mens use. In this paper, the researchers examine mens and womens speech through sentiment analysis. For the study of gender differences, this study uses the BNC64 corpus, whose files are selected from the British National Corpus (BNC). The BNC64 corpus is composed of 64 files, which are taken from the spoken part of the BNC. The corpus contains 32 files for male speakers and 32 files for female speakers that represent the characteristics of male vs. female differences. The study analyzed all 64 files using sentiment analysis and tried to discover the differences. It is known that there are roughly three types of approach to sentiment analysis: dictionary-based analysis, machine-learning-based analysis, and deep-learning-based analysis. This study takes the first and third kind of analyses. In the dictionary-based analysis, the researchers calculate the sentiment score (SS), sentiment word ratio (SR), and positive word ratio (PR). In the deep-learning analysis, the researchers take two different sorts of analyses: the GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) and the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Through the analyses, the study finds that (i) there is no significant differences in SS and SR between men and women, (ii) women usually use more positive words than men, and the differences are statistically significant, and (iii) the deep-learning-based analysis is much superior to modelling the gender differences in the sentiment analysis."
Review on the Recent Welding Research with Application of CNN-Based Deep Learning Part I: Models and Applications,2021,"['Deep learning', 'Convolution Neural Network', 'Image', 'Welding', 'Model', 'Application']",,"During machine learning algorithms, deep learning refers to a neural network containing multiple hidden layers.

Among the deep learning algorithms, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has recently received the spotlight for performing classification or regression based on image input. CNNs enables end-to-end learning without feature extraction and in-situ estimation of the process outputs. In this paper, 18 recent papers were reviewed to investigate how to apply CNN models to welding. The papers was classified into 5 groups: four for supervised learning models and one for unsupervised learning models. The classification of supervised learning groups was based on the application of transfer learning and data augmentation. For each paper, the structure and performance of its CNN model were described, and also its application in welding was explained."
Image Enhanced Machine Vision System for Smart Factory,2021,"['Image Enhancing', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Autoencoder', 'Machine Vision']",,"Machine vision is a technology that helps the computer as if a person recognizes and determines things. In recent years, as advanced technologies such as optical systems, artificial intelligence and big data advanced in conventional machine vision system became more accurate quality inspection and it increases the manufacturing efficiency. In machine vision systems using deep learning, the image quality of the input image is very important. However, most images obtained in the industrial field for quality inspection typically contain noise. This noise is a major factor in the performance of the machine vision system. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of the machine vision system, it is necessary to eliminate the noise of the image. There are lots of research being done to remove noise from the image. In this paper, we propose an autoencoder based machine vision system to eliminate noise in the image. Through experiment proposed model showed better performance compared to the basic autoencoder model in denoising and image reconstruction capability for MNIST and fashion MNIST data sets."
Performance Enhancement of CSMA/CA MAC Protocol Based on Reinforcement Learning,2021,"['CSMA/CA', 'IEEE 802', '11', 'Q-Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Wireless LANs']",,"Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning that studies how an intelligent agent takes actions in a given environment to maximize the cumulative reward. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol based on the Q-learning technique of reinforcement learning to improve the performance of the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN CSMA/CA MAC protocol. Furthermore, the operation of each access point (AP) and station is proposed. The AP adjusts the value of the contention window (CW), which is the range for determining the backoff number of the station, according to the wireless traffic load. The station improves the performance by selecting an optimal backoff number with the lowest packet collision rate and the highest transmission success rate through Q-learning within the CW value transmitted from the AP. The result of the performance evaluation through computer simulations showed that the proposed scheme has a higher throughput than that of the existing CSMA/CA scheme."
Secure Training Support Vector Machine with Partial Sensitive Part,2021,"['Privacy-preserving Machine Learning', 'Support Vector Machine', 'Homomorphic Encryption', 'Privacy', 'Secure Machine Learning', '프라이버시 보호 기계 학습', '공정성', '동형 암호', '프라이버시', '안전한 기계 학습']",,"In this paper, we propose a training algorithm of support vector machine (SVM) with a sensitive variable. Although machine learning models enable automatic decision making in the real world applications, regulations prohibit sensitive information from being used to protect privacy. In particular, the privacy protection of the legally protected attributes such as race, gender, and disability is compulsory. We present an efficient least square SVM (LSSVM) training algorithm using a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to protect a partial sensitive attribute. Our framework posits that data owner has both non-sensitive attributes and a sensitive attribute while machine learning service provider (MLSP) can get non-sensitive attributes and an encrypted sensitive attribute. As a result, data owner can obtain the encrypted model parameters without exposing their sensitive information to MLSP. In the inference phase, both non-sensitive attributes and a sensitive attribute are encrypted, and all computations should be conducted on encrypted domain. Through the experiments on real data, we identify that our proposed method enables to implement privacy-preserving sensitive LSSVM with FHE that has comparable performance with the original LSSVM algorithm. In addition, we demonstrate that the efficient sensitive LSSVM with FHE significantly improves the computational cost with a small degradation of performance."
Deep learning for computer-assisted diagnosis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer,2021,"['Machine learning', 'Pathology', 'Computer-assisted diagnosis', 'Stomach neoplasms', 'Deep learning']",,"Background: Patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer often undergo prophylactic gastrectomy to minimize cancer risk. Because intramucosal poorly cohesive carcinomas in this setting are typically not grossly visible, many pathologists assess the entire gastrectomy specimen microscopically. With 150 or more slides per case, this is a major time burden for pathologists. This study utilizes deep learning methods to analyze digitized slides and detect regions of carcinoma. Methods: Prophylactic gastrectomy specimens from seven patients with germline CDH1 mutations were analyzed (five for training/validation and two for testing, with a total of 133 tumor foci). All hematoxylin and eosin slides containing cancer foci were digitally scanned, and patches of size 256 × 256 pixels were randomly extracted from regions of cancer as well as from regions of normal background tissue, resulting in 15,851 images for training/validation and 970 images for testing. A model with DenseNet-169 architecture was trained for 150 epochs, then evaluated on images from the test set. External validation was conducted on 814 images scanned at an outside institution. Results: On individual patches, the trained model achieved a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9986. This enabled it to maintain a sensitivity of 90% with a false-positive rate of less than 0.1%. On the external validation dataset, the model achieved a similar ROC AUC of 0.9984. On whole slide images, the network detected 100% of tumor foci and correctly eliminated an average of 99.9% of the non-cancer slide area from consideration. Conclusions: Overall, our model shows encouraging progress towards computer-assisted diagnosis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer."
Reproduction strategy of radiation data with compensation of data loss using a deep learning technique,2021,"['Deep learning', 'U-net algorithm', 'Radiation map', 'Sensor network system', 'Reproduction']",,"In nuclear-related facilities, such as nuclear power plants, research reactors, accelerators, and nuclear waste storage sites, radiation detection, and mapping are required to prevent radiation overexposure. Sensor network systems consisting of radiation sensor interfaces and wxireless communication units have become promising tools that can be used for data collection of radiation detection that can in turn be used to draw a radiation map. During data collection, malfunctions in some of the sensors can occasionally occur due to radiation effects, physical damage, network defects, sensor loss, or other reasons. This paper proposes a reproduction strategy for radiation maps using a U-net model to compensate for the loss of radiation detection data. To perform machine learning and verification, 1,561 simulations and 417 measured data of a sensor network were performed. The reproduction results show an accuracy of over 90%. The proposed strategy can offer an effective method that can be used to resolve the data loss problem for conventional sensor network systems and will specifically contribute to making initial responses with preserved data and without the high cost of radiation leak accidents at nuclear facilities."
Supervised learning and frequency domain averaging‐based adaptive channel estimation scheme for filterbank multicarrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation,2021,"['channel estimation', 'FBMC‐OQAM', 'frequency domain averaging', 'k‐nearest neighbors', 'supervised machine learning']",,"Filterbank multicarrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC‐OQAM) is an attractive alternative to the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique. In comparison with OFDM, the FBMC‐OQAM signal has better spectral confinement and higher spectral efficiency and tolerance to synchronization errors, primarily due to per‐subcarrier filtering using a frequency‐time localized prototype filter. However, the filtering process introduces intrinsic interference among the symbols and complicates channel estimation (CE). An efficient way to improve the CE in FBMC‐OQAM is using a technique known as windowed frequency domain averaging (FDA); however, it requires a priori knowledge of the window length parameter which is set based on the channel's frequency selectivity (FS). As the channel's FS is not fixed and not a priori known, we propose a k‐nearest neighbor‐based machine learning algorithm to classify the FS and decide on the FDA's window length. A comparative theoretical analysis of the mean‐squared error (MSE) is performed to prove the proposed CE scheme's effectiveness, validated through extensive simulations. The adaptive CE scheme is shown to yield a reduction in CE‐MSE and improved bit error rates compared with the popular preamble‐based CE schemes for FBMC‐OQAM, without a priori knowledge of channel's frequency selectivity."
Understanding Which Images Degrade Deep Learning Classification Performance,2021,"['Adversarial examples', 'Machine learning and deep learning', 'Image classification', 'Computer vision']",,"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown high success and accuracy in various classification tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, segmentation, etc. However, DNNs provide low classification performance when the train and test distributions differ (i.e., out-of-distribution). In this study, we investigate each visual characteristic of the correctly classified and misclassified images (referred to as natural adversarial examples) on CIFAR10 to understand which images substantially degrade machine learning and deep learning models’ classification performances. To verify this, we divide the classification results into two groups per class: correct prediction and incorrect prediction. Then, we compare the visual appearance (e.g., image point of view) of examples of correct predictions with those of incorrect predictions. Our experimental results demonstrated that correctly classified examples have several common visual characteristics, which differ from those of natural adversarial examples."
Simultaneous neural machine translation with a reinforced attention mechanism,2021,"['attention mechanism', 'neural network', 'reinforcement learning', 'simultaneous machine translation']",,"To translate in real time, a simultaneous translation system should determine when to stop reading source tokens and generate target tokens corresponding to a partial source sentence read up to that point. However, conventional attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) models cannot produce translations with adequate latency in online scenarios because they wait until a source sentence is completed to compute alignment between the source and target tokens. To address this issue, we propose a reinforced learning (RL)-based attention mechanism, the reinforced attention mechanism, which allows a neural translation model to jointly train the stopping criterion and a partial translation model. The proposed attention mechanism comprises two modules, one to ensure translation quality and the other to address latency. Different from previous RL-based simultaneous translation systems, which learn the stopping criterion from a fixed NMT model, the modules can be trained jointly with a novel reward function. In our experiments, the proposed model has better translation quality and comparable latency compared to previous models."

Training-Free Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning,2021,"['Neural Architecture Search', 'Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search', 'NAS without Training']",,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is cutting-edge technology in the machine learning community. NAS Without Training (NASWOT) recently has been proposed to tackle the high demand of computational resources in NAS by leveraging some indicators to predict the performance of architectures before training. The advantage of these indicators is that they do not require any training. Thus, NASWOT reduces the searching time and computational cost significantly. However, NASWOT only considers high-performing networks which does not guarantee a fast inference speed on hardware devices. In this paper, we propose a multi objectives reward function, which considers the network’s latency and the predicted performance, and incorporate it into the Reinforcement Learning approach to search for the best networks with low latency. Unlike other methods, which use FLOPs to measure the latency that does not reflect the actual latency, we obtain the network’s latency from the hardware NAS bench. We conduct extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-16-120 datasets, and show that the proposed method is capable of generating the best network under latency constrained without training subnetworks."
A High-Precision Feature Extraction Network of Fatigue Speech from Air Traffic Controller Radiotelephony Based on Improved Deep Learning,2021,"['Air traffic control', 'Fatigue', 'SSAE', 'Active learning', 'Dense block', 'Spectrogram']",,"Air traffic controller (ATC) fatigue is receiving considerable attention in recent studies because it represents a major cause of air traffic incidences. Research has revealed that the presence of fatigue can be detected by analysing speech utterances. However, constructing a complete labelled fatigue data set is very time-consuming. Moreover, a manually constructed speech collection will often contain only little key information to be used effectively in fatigue recognition, while multilevel deep models based on such speech materials often have overfitting problems due to an explosive increase of model parameters. To address these problems, a novel deep learning framework is proposed in this study to integrate active learning (AL) into complex speech features selected from a large set of unlabelled speech data in order to overcome the loss of information. A shallow feature set is first extracted using stacked sparse autoencoder networks, in which fatigue state challenge features from a manually selected speaker set of are exploited as the input vector. A densely connected convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) is then proposed to learn advanced features automatically from spectrograms of the selected data to supplement the fatigue features. The network can be effectively trained using a relatively small number of labelled samples with the help of AL sampling strategies, and the addition of a dense block to the convolutional automatic encoder can decrease the number of parameters and make the model easier to fit. Finally, the two above-mentioned features are combined using multiple kernel learning with a support-vector-machine classifier. A series of comparative experiments using the Civil Aviation Administration of China radiotelephony corpus demonstrates that the proposed method provides a significant improvement in the detection precision compared to current state-of-the-art approaches."

Application of Neural Network Based on Real-Time Recursive Learning and Kalman Filter in Flight Data Identification,2021,"['Flight simulator', 'Aerodynamic model', 'Aerodynamic parameter identification', 'Recurrent neural network']",,"The process of obtaining flight data from flight test is complex and costly, which makes it difficult to identify aerodynamic parameters. Therefore, Cessna172 flight simulator was used for flight data extraction, which ensures the convenience, efficiency and economy of the test. To obtain aerodynamic model, based on the idea of machine learning, a recurrent neural network was used to process multi-dimensional nonlinear flight test data, and a real-time recursive learning algorithm was proved to be suitable for dynamic training. Due to the large amount of state parameter data generated by aircraft, which will cause the real-time recursive learning algorithm to train slowly. So, Kalman filter algorithm was introduced for system identification. Considering validity analysis, the comparative verification method was used to verify system identification model. Results show that the aircraft aerodynamic and aerodynamic moment models have good applicability and can be popularized and applied."

Human-machine system optimization in nuclear facility systems,2021,"['Human-machine interface', 'Human error', 'Human performance', 'System optimization', 'Nuclear safety', 'Automation']",,"Present computing power and enhanced technology is progressing at a dramatic rate. These systems can unravel complex issues, assess and control processes, learn, and-in many cases-fully automate production. There is no doubt that technological advancement is improving many aspects of life, changing the landscape of virtually all industries and enhancing production beyond what was thought possible. However, the human is still a part of these systems. Consequently, as the advancement of systems transpires, the role of humans within those systems will unavoidably continue to adapt as well. Due to the human tendency for error, this technological advancement should compel a persistent emphasis on human error reduction as part of maximizing system efficiency and safety-especially in the context of the nuclear industry. Within this context, as new systems are designed and the role of the human is transformed, human error should be targeted for a significant decrease relative to predecessor systems and an equivalent increase in system stability and safety. This article contends that optimizing the roles of humans and machines in the design and implementation of new types of automation in nuclear facility systems should involve human error reduction without ignoring the essential importance of human interaction within those systems."

Quantitative Assessment of Chest CT Patterns in COVID-19 and Bacterial Pneumonia Patients: a Deep Learning Perspective,2021,"['COVID-19', 'Pneumonia', 'Bacterial', 'Computed Tomography', 'Deep Learning', 'Cluster Analysis']",,"Background: It is difficult to distinguish subtle differences shown in computed tomography (CT) images of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and bacterial pneumonia patients, which often leads to an inaccurate diagnosis. It is desirable to design and evaluate interpretable feature extraction techniques to describe the patient's condition.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 170 confirmed patients with COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia acquired at Yeungnam University Hospital in Daegu, Korea. The lung and lesion regions were segmented to crop the lesion into 2D patches to train a classifier model that could differentiate between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The K-means algorithm was used to cluster deep features extracted by the trained model into 20 groups.Each lesion patch cluster was described by a characteristic imaging term for comparison.For each CT image containing multiple lesions, a histogram of lesion types was constructed using the cluster information. Finally, a Support Vector Machine classifier was trained with the histogram and radiomics features to distinguish diseases and severity.Results: The 20 clusters constructed from 170 patients were reviewed based on common radiographic appearance types. Two clusters showed typical findings of COVID-19, with two other clusters showing typical findings related to bacterial pneumonia. Notably, there is one cluster that showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the central and peripheral lungs and was considered to be a key factor for severity classification. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 91.2% for classifying COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia patients with 95% reported for severity classification. The CT quantitative parameters represented by the values of cluster 8 were correlated with existing laboratory data and clinical parameters.Conclusion: Deep chest CT analysis with constructed lesion clusters revealed well-known COVID-19 CT manifestations comparable to manual CT analysis. The constructed histogram features improved accuracy for both diseases and severity classification, and showed correlations with laboratory data and clinical parameters. The constructed histogram features can provide guidance for improved analysis and treatment of COVID-19."
Development of a Surface Roughness Evaluation Method from Light and Shade Composition using Deep Learning,2021,"['Surface roughness', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Evaluation method', 'Light and shade']",,"Many companies agree on the need to introduce smart factories that promote low-cost, high-efficiency operation by applying IoT technologies to manufacturing plants.

To demonstrate the usefulness of the developed technique, 305 samples of paper were categorized into three classes based on Ra threshold values, and images of paper were taken using a microscope camera. Luminance values, standard deviations, mean values, and image histograms were used to train custom-designed CNN+ LSTM composite neural networks. Completely new samples of non-training data were used for validation, which showed an accuracy of 85.185%.

It can be easily integrated into an assembly line and automate quality assurance processes. This method could also prove useful in reducing labor costs and streamlining quality assurance processes due to its flexible adaptability."
A Systematic Implementation of Deepfake Multimedia Video Generation and Detection using Deep Learning,2021,,,"In the following years, technology has progressed in so many ways that it has provided the cyber society with a resource that only computers can excel at, such as the art of counterfeit of media, which was before unavailable. Deepfakes are a term used to describe this kind of deception. The majority of well-documented Deep Fakes are produced using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Models, which are essentially two distinct Machine Learning Models that perform the roles of attack and defence. These models create and identify deepfakes until they reach a point where the morphing no longer detects the deepfakes anymore. Using this algorithm/model, it is possible to discover and create new media that has a similar demographic to the training set, resulting in the development of the ideal Deep Fake media. Because the alterations are carried out utilising advanced characteristics, they cannot be seen with the human eye. However, it is completely feasible to develop an algorithm that can automatically identify this kind of tampering carried out via the internet. This not only enables us to broaden the scope of our search beyond a single media item, but also beyond a large library of mixed media. The more it learns, the better it becomes as artificial intelligence takes over in full force with automation. In order to create better deep fakes, new models are being developed all the time, making it more difficult to distinguish between genuine and morphing material."

An ensemble soft weighted gene selection-based approach and cancer classification using modified metaheuristic learning,2021,"['microarray gene expression', 'wrapper models', 'ensemble feature selection', 'cancer classification', 'water cycle algorithm', 'soft weighing']",,"Hybrid algorithms are effective methods for solving optimization problems that rarely have been used in the gene selection procedure. This paper introduces a novel modified model for microarray data classification using an optimized gene subset selection method. The proposed approach consists of ensemble feature selection based on wrapper methods using five criteria, which reduces the data dimensions and time complexity. Five feature ranking procedures, including receiver operating characteristic curve, two-sample T-test, Wilcoxon, Bhattacharyya distance, and entropy, are used in the soft weighting method. Besides, we proposed a classification method that used the support vector machine (SVM) and metaheuristic algorithm. The optimization of the SVM hyper-parameters for the radial basis function (RBF) kernel function is performed using a modified Water Cycle Algorithm (mWCA). The results indicate that the ensemble performance of genes-mWCA SVM (EGmWS) is considered an efficient method compared to similar approaches in terms of accuracy and solving the uncertainty problem. Five benchmark microarray datasets, including leukemia, MicroRNA-Breast, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, prostate, and colon, are employed for experiments. The highest and lowest numbers of genes are related to prostate with 12 533 genes and MicroRNA-Breast with 1926 genes, respectively. Besides, the highest and lowest numbers of samples are MicroRNA-Breast with 132 samples and colon with 62 samples, respectively. The results of classifying all data by applying effective genes of the EF-WS yielded high accuracies in microarray data classification. In addition to the robustness and simplicity of the proposed method, the model’s generalizability is another crucial aspect of the method that can be further developed to increase the accuracy while reducing classification error."

Results comparison was conducted using bias and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which are predictive accuracy verification indicators, based on the heavy rain case on August 21, 2021. By comparing the rainfall simulated using the improved HQPF and the observed accumulated rainfall, it was revealed that all HQPFs (conventional HQPF and improved HQPF 1 and HQPF 2) showed a decrease in rainfall as the lead time increased for the entire grid region. Hence, the difference from the observed rainfall increased. In the accumulated rainfall evaluation due to the reduction of input factors, compared to the existing HQPF, improved HQPF 1 and 2 predicted a larger accumulated rainfall. Furthermore, HQPF 2 used the lowest number of input factors and simulated more accumulated rainfall than that projected by conventional HQPF and HQPF 1. By improving the performance of conventional machine learning despite using lesser variables, the preprocessing period and model execution time can be reduced, thereby contributing to model optimization. As an additional advanced method of HQPF 1 and 2 mentioned above, a simulated analysis of the Local ENsemble prediction System (LENS) ensemble member and low pressure, one of the observed meteorological factors, was analyzed. Based on the results of this study, if we select for the positively performing ensemble members based on the heavy rain characteristics of Korea or apply additional weights differently for each ensemble member, the prediction accuracy is expected to increase."

Undisturbed specimens were sampled according to landslide occurrence, and dynamic cone penetration testing measured the depth of the soil layer during geological field surveys. Laboratory tests were performed following the standards of ASTM International. To solve the problem of multicollinearity, the variation inflation factor was calculated for all factors related to landslides, and then nine factors (shear strength, lithology, saturated water content, specific gravity, hydraulic conductivity, USCS, slope angle, and elevation) were determined as influential factors for consideration by machine learning techniques. Minimum-maximum normalization compared factors directly with each other. Logistic regression analysis identified soil depth, slope angle, saturated water content, and shear strength as having the greatest influence (in that order) on the occurrence of landslides. Artificial neural network analysis ranked factors by greatest influence in the order of slope angle, soil depth, saturated water content, and shear strength. Arithmetically averaging the effectiveness of both analyses found slope angle, soil depth, saturated water content, and shear strength as the top four factors.

A sufficient period of flow data is required to calculate the Flow Duration Curve. However, in order to calculate the Flow Duration Curve, it is essential to secure flow data for more than 30 years. However, in the case of rivers below the national river unit, there is no long-term flow data or there are observed data missing for a certain period in the middle, so there is a limit to calculating the Flow Duration Curve for each river. In the past, statistical-based methods such as Multiple Regression Analysis and ARIMA models were used to predict sulfur in the unmeasured watershed, but recently, the demand for machine learning and deep learning models is increasing. Therefore, in this study, we present the DNN technique, which is a machine learning technique that fits the latest paradigm. The DNN technique is a method that compensates for the shortcomings of the ANN technique, such as difficult to find optimal parameter values ​​in the learning process and slow learning time. Therefore, in this study, the Flow Duration Curve applicable to the unmeasured watershed is calculated using the DNN model.

Thus, determining the optimal location of refueling stations is an important topic in the network. Although previous studies have mostly applied optimization based methodologies, this paper adopts machine learning to review spatial attributes of candidate locations in selecting the optimal position of the refueling stations. Machine learning shows outstanding performance in various fields. However, it has not yet applied to an optimal location selection problem of hydrogen refueling stations. Therefore, several machine learning models are applied and compared in performance by setting variables relevant to the location of highway rest areas and random points on a highway.

To this end, the open commercial district data of ‘Our Village Shop Commercial Area Analysis Service’ operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government was utilized. First, as a result of analyzing the predictive performance of business closure, the random forest model was the highest for the service industry and the support vector machine model was the highest for the catering industry. Subsequently, the factors that have the most influencing on the business closure prediction model were the surviving population by building unit, average operating period, and rent in the case of the service industry, and rent, the number of households, and the surviving population by building in the catering business. Through this, new self-employed persons can grasp the characteristics of the commercial district they want to enter and build a survival strategy appropriate for them, and local governments and governments can use them as indicators of support policies such as sales strategy consulting and capacity building for existing self-employed persons. This study is significant in that it has shown the potential to predict the closure of self-employed people by using representative machine learning techniques and by using easily collected data alone.

Recently, advanced machine learning models have increasingly been used for water quality prediction. This study developed an ensemble machine learning model to predict SSC using the XGBoost (XGB) algorithm. The observed discharge (Q) and SSC in two fields monitoring stations were used to develop the model. The input variables were clustered in two groups with low and high ranges of Q using the k-means clustering algorithm. Then each group of data was separately used to optimize XGB (Model 1). The model performance was compared with that of the XGB model using the entire data (Model 2). The models were evaluated by mean squared error-observation standard deviation ratio (RSR) and root mean squared error. The RSR were 0.51 and 0.57 in the two monitoring stations for Model 2, respectively, while the model performance improved to RSR 0.46 and 0.55, respectively, for Model 1."

Recently, in connection with cloud technology, its utility as a service product is increasing. Among the diseases dealt with in this paper, liver disease is a disease with very high risk because it is difficult to diagnose early due to the lack of pain. Artificial intelligence technology was introduced based on medical images as a non-invasive diagnostic method for diagnosing these diseases. We describe the development of a web service to help the most meaningful clinical reading of liver cirrhosis patients. Then, it shows the web service process and shows the operation screen of each process and the final result screen. It is expected that the proposed service will be able to diagnose liver cirrhosis at an early stage and help patients recover through rapid treatment."

A rapid increase of senior involvement in crashes calls for developing appropriate crash-severity prediction models specific to senior drivers. In that regard, this study leverages machine learning (ML) algorithms so as to predict the severity of vehicle-pedestrian collisions induced by elderly drivers. Specifically, four ML algorithms (i.e., Logistic model, K-nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) have been developed and compared. Our results show that Logistic model and SVM have outperformed their rivals in terms of the overall prediction accuracy, while precision measure exhibits in favor of RF. We also clarify that driver education and technology development would be effective countermeasures against severity risks of senior driver-induced collisions. These allow us to support informed decision making for policymakers to enhance public safety."

The subject of this study was the eyebrows, which greatly needed to be in harmony with other parts of the face. To achieve the objective, this study reviewed previous studies related to machine learning, face detection, and eyebrow design. Based on the literature review, this study identified that machine learning should focus on the measurement point of the face from the fact that (1) the semi-permanent eyebrow make-up treatment using machine learning was supervised learning and (2) measurement point error was the main issue in face detection-related studies. As a prerequisite for recommending eyebrow, it is necessary to elaborately learn measurement points for the overall face, those for the eye, close to the eyebrow, and those for lips, closely related to the length of the eyebrow. Therefore, this study presented measurement points for the overall face, eyes, and lips. Specifically, overall face, eyes, and lips required twelve, seven, and six measurement points, respectively. Moreover, as a result of the recommendation, five measurement points were needed for eyebrows and six shape data were required. To apply machine learning, a customer needs a step to experience that an eyebrow design recommended by machine learning is projected on the face of the customer in an augmented reality system similar to the existing make-up app and choose a desired shape. The machine learning-based recommendation system has many advantages over existing make-up programs and expert consultations. Above all, it provides a higher level of eyebrow designs through collaboration with experts, fundamentally expands the market for semi-permanent eyebrow make-up based on this, and furthermore, can be applied to various parts related to the contour of a face, such as lip line and hairline, which are advantages of it."

Compared to individual investor groups, professional investor groups such as foreign investors have an advantage in information and financial power and, as a result, foreign investors are known to show good investment performance among market participants.  The purpose of this study is to propose an investment strategy that combines investor-specific transaction information and machine learning, and to analyze the portfolio investment performance of the proposed model using actual stock price and investor-specific transaction data. The Korea Exchange offers daily information on the volume of purchase and sale of each investor to securities firms. We developed a data collection program in C# programming language using an API provided by Daishin Securities Cybosplus, and collected 151 out of 200 KOSPI stocks with daily opening price, closing price and investor-specific net purchase data from January 2, 2007 to July 31, 2017.  The self-organizing map model is an artificial neural network that performs clustering by unsupervised learning and has been introduced by Teuvo Kohonen since 1984. We implement competition among intra-surface artificial neurons, and all connections are non-recursive artificial neural networks that go from bottom to top. It can also be expanded to multiple layers, although many fault layers are commonly used. Linear functions are used by active functions of artificial nerve cells, and learning rules use Instar rules as well as general competitive learning. The core of the backpropagation model is the model that performs classification by supervised learning as an artificial neural network.  We grouped and transformed investor-specific transaction volume data to learn backpropagation models through the self-organizing map model of artificial neural networks. As a result of the estimation of verification data through training, the portfolios were rebalanced monthly. For performance analysis, a passive portfolio was designated and the KOSPI 200 and KOSPI index returns for proxies on market returns were also obtained.  Performance analysis was conducted using the equally-weighted portfolio return, compound interest rate, annual return, Maximum Draw Down, standard deviation, and Sharpe Ratio. Buy and hold returns of the top 10 market capitalization stocks are designated as a benchmark. Buy and hold strategy is the best strategy under the efficient market hypothesis. The prediction rate of learning data using backpropagation model was significantly high at 96.61%, while the prediction rate of verification data was also relatively high in the results of the 57.1% verification data. The performance evaluation of self-organizing map grouping can be determined as a result of a backpropagation model. This is because if the grouping results of the self-organizing map model had been poor, the learning results of the backpropagation model would have been poor. In this way, the performance assessment of machine learning is judged to be better learned than previous studies.  Our portfolio doubled the return on the benchmark and performed better than the market returns on the KOSPI and KOSPI 200 indexes. In contrast to the benchmark, the MDD and standard deviation for portfolio risk indicators also showed better results. The Sharpe Ratio performed higher than benchmarks and stock market indexes. Through this, we presented the direction of portfolio composition program using machine learning and investor-specific transaction information and showed that it can be used to develop programs for real stock investment.  The return is the result of monthly portfolio composition and asset rebalancing to the same proportion. Better outcomes are predicted when forming a monthly portfolio if the system is enforced by rebalancing the suggested stocks continuously without selling and re-buying it."

As a result, FC data from DJI and Parrot such as Mavic2 and Anafi were unable to analyze machine learning for entertainment. It is because data is collected at intervals of 0.1 second or more, so that it is impossible to find correlation with other data with GCS. On the other hand, it was found that machine learning technologies can be applied in the case of Fixhawk, which used an ARM processor and operates with the Nuttx OS.

In particular, the work related to the fund plan and the operation plan of the treasury through manual work is subject to improvement, and a financial estimation system is needed to achieve it.. In this study, we wanted to analyze whether it is possible to predict the balance of the treasury by utilizing machine learning. First of all, we developed a forecasting model for treasury balances. In addition, to verify the applicability, the government balance predictability of machine learning techniques, performance verification, and major variable verification were performed. In detail, data collection and refinement, exploratory analysis, analytical model design and development, and analysis result review were studied. The analysis target data is 120 months of total data from 2010 to 2019, limited to income tax and value-added tax revenue forecasts, with monthly revenue volume and major taxes. This was predicted for 2019 tax revenue respectively. The application algorithms are Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. According to the analysis, Linear Regression was the best in revenue and income taxes, while Gradient Boosting was the best in VAT. In conclusion, it was analyzed that machine learning was applicable to treasury predictions. This will allow quick results, scientific analysis through the introduction of big data-based models, and the person in charge will be able to improve predictive power through new model tests.

APT는 복잡하고 다양한 방법과 기술을 사용하여 공격 대상으 로부터 중요 정보를 탈취하기 위해 공격한다. 이러한 APT는 첨단 기술과 인공지능의 발달로 공격 방식도 매우 지능화 되고 있는게 현실이다. 이러한 APT 공격은 특정 공격 대상에 맞게 설계되어 있어서 미리 설계된 규칙 기반 기법들로 는 탐지가 어렵다. 따라서 본 논문에서는 APT 공격 탐지를 위해 APT 공격 초기에 C&C 서버와의 연결을 탐지하는 기 법을 제안하였다. 이 기법은 C&C 서버와 멀웨어의 연결을 초기에 탐지하게 된다면 APT 공격에 대해 신속하게 대처할 수 있는 장점을 가질 수 있게 된다. 이러한 효율성을 높이기 위하여 DNS 서버와 관련한 네트워크 트래픽을 수집한 후 머신러닝을 기반으로 한 분석을 통해 C&C 서버를 탐지하는 방법을 제안하였다. 제안한 기법의 우수한 성능은 위해 실 험을 통해 확인할 수 있었다.,"APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attack is one of the most threatening attacks among various attacks that exist in cyberspace, and has a clear intention and target. APT attacks to steal sensitive information from the target using complex and diverse methods and techniques. The reality is that the attack method of these APTs is also becoming very intelligent due to the development of advanced technology and artificial intelligence. Since these APT attacks are designed for a specific attack target, it is difficult to detect them with pre-designed rule-based techniques. Therefore, in this paper, for APT attack detection, we propose a method to detect the connection with the C&C server in the early stage of an APT attack. If this technique detects the connection between the C&C server and malware at an early stage, it can have the advantage of quickly responding to APT attacks. To increase this efficiency, we proposed a method of detecting the C&C server through machine learning-based analysis after collecting network traffic related to the DNS server. The excellent performance of the proposed technique was confirmed through experiments."

The presented study develops and compares classifier-based and deep learning-based models that can effectively determine pavement roughness grades. METHODS : A set road specimen was developed for various IRIs by generating road profiles with matching standard deviations. In addition, five distinct features from road images, including mean, peak-to-peak, standard variation, and mean absolute deviation, were extracted to develop a classifier-based model. From parametric studies, a support vector machine (SVM) was selected. To further demonstrate that the model is more applicable to real-world problems, with a non-integer road grade, a deep-learning model was developed. The algorithm was proposed by modifying the MNIST database, and the model input parameters were determined to achieve higher precision. RESULTS : The results of the proposed algorithms indicated the potential of using computer vision-based models for classifying road surface roughness. When SVM was adopted, near 100% precision was achieved for the training data, and 98% for the test data. Although the model indicated accurate results, the model was classified based on integer IRIs, which is less practical. Alternatively, a deep-learning model, which can be applied to a non-integer road grade, indicated an accuracy of over 85%. CONCLUSIONS : In this study, both the classifier-based, and deep-learning-based models indicated high precision for estimating road surface roughness grades. However, because the proposed algorithm has only been verified against the road model with fixed integers, optimization and verification of the proposed algorithm need to be performed for a real road condition."

However, the number of such tests is generally restricted due to their high cost. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) models involving machine learning and deep learning are being developed as supplemental methods to estimate pile capacities. Clearer and more reliable models need to be developed on an ongoing basis, considering the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence algorithms, hardware and developing platforms, and data. The applicability of machine learning models using linear regression and decision tree ensemble algorithms to estimate pile bearing capacities were evaluated in this study for the following purposes: 1) building up the environment for developing artificial intelligence models, such as the open-source Python platform, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, etc., 2) evaluation of machine learning models for estimating a pile load capacity, 3) reviewing and utilizing the existing pile load test databases for developing AI models of pile foundations, 4) conducting base studies for the future extension of models for the estimation of the settlement and load-displacement of piles. The investigated machine learning models were found to estimate pile load capacities with scores in terms of the coefficient of determinant over 0.5. The most appropriate ensemble models for the pile load estimation were the gradient boosting and XB boosting models.

The strength of the laser overlap welds is determined by the strength distribution of weldments and the bead width at the faying surface. In the case of high-strength steel sheets, it is difficult to predict the fracture load and fracture mode during the tensile shear test of the weldment owing to the high strength of the base material, softening of the heat affected zone (HAZ), and small bead width. In this study, we investigated machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks, to develop a fracture mode classification model and regression models for joint strength and bead width. Machine learning algorithms have shown excellent performance in predicting mechanical behaviors during tensile shear tests. Among the machine learning regression algorithms, Gaussian process regression showed the best regression ability.

However, regarding the domestic crime prediction research using machine learning, the current related studies are insufficient because disclosure of crime data is restricted and most of these studies predicted crimes by using a wide range of analysis units or by focusing on a few variables. To effectively distribute police power through practical crime prediction, it is necessary to predict the time and place of the crime. Therefore, in this study, we train machine learning models with 9,413 instances of actual theft crime data having temporal-spatial elements such as crime time and date, buildings, land-use, and CCTV. Thereby, we intend to provide a basis for future research and assist crime prevention activities practically by comparing the results of the prediction models. In this study, we divided the target land into 100 m square grids by using GIS and then inserted crime and temporal-spatial related variables. Subsequently, we trained the typical machine learning models such as random forest, decision trees, SVC, and K-NN, conducted crime prediction, and compared the results of the models. In the case of crime data, generally, an excessive amount of unbalanced data is present for the places where crimes did not occur compared to places where crimes occurred. Unbalanced data can result in noise and cause inaccurate predictions-these issues must be addressed. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a resampling method as an alternative to solve data imbalances and provide crime prediction with improved accuracy. The results of the comparison of the prediction performance of the models showed that the F1 score of the random forest model using the SMOTE method was high. This could be because the data loss of the SMOTE method is less than that of the under-sampling method and the random forest as an ensemble type model has an advantage in predicting data with various variables. We compared the influence of each variable by employing the feature importance function. Overall, the temporal-related variables showed high influence-among them, crimes occurred within one month showed the highest influence. Among the physical environment-related variables, first neighborhood living facility, retail store, and detached house were found to have high influence."

The export growth rate may have a negative (-) value as well as a positive (+) value. Therefore, Instead of using the ReLU function, which is often used for time series prediction of deep learning models, the PReLU function, which can have a negative (-) value as an output value, was used as the activation function of deep learning models. The time series prediction performance of each model for three types of data was compared and reviewed. The forecast data of long-term prediction of export growth rate was deduced by three forecast methods such as a fixed forecast method, a recursive forecast method and a rolling forecast method. As a result of the forecast, the traditional time series analysis model, ARDL, showed excellent performance, but as the time period of learning data increases, the performance of machine learning models including LSTM was relatively improved."
머신러닝 기반의 돈사 악취농도 예측 (황화수소 농도를 중심으로),2021,"['KNN regression', 'Machine learning', 'Regression', 'Ridge regression', 'Random forest']",,"Odor is a type of sensory pollution that can stimulate the human sense of smell when it occurs, causing discomfort and making it difficult to create a pleasant environment. For this reason, there is a high possibility of complaints regarding odors if odors occur in pigsties near residential properties, and the number of such complaints is also increasing. In addition, odors emanating from pigsties around military installations can cause physical and psychological harm, not only to the soldiers living in these type of facilities but also to the families belonging to military personnel living there as well. Because the concentration of odors varies due to diverse factors such as temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, and interaction between causative materials, predicting odors based on only one factor is not proper or appropriate. Therefore, in this work, we sought to construct models that are based on several regression techniques of machine learning using data collected in field. And we selected and utilized the model that has the highest-accuracy in order to notify and warn residents of odors in advance. In this work, 3672 data items were used to train and test the model. The several machine learning algorithms to build the models are polynomial regression, ridge regression, K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN Regression), and random forest. Comparing the performance of models based on each algorithm, the study found that KNN Regression was the most suitable model, and the result obtained from KNN regression was significant."

In particular, web-based cryptojacking is easy to attack because the victim can mine cryptocurrencies using the victim""s PC resources just by accessing the website and simply adding mining scripts. The cryptojacking attack causes poor performance and malfunction. It can also cause hardware failure due to overheating and aging caused by mining. Cryptojacking is difficult for victims to recognize the damage, so research is needed to efficiently detect and block cryptojacking. In this work, we take representative distinct symptoms of cryptojacking as an indicator and propose a new architecture. We utilized the K-Nearst Neighbors(KNN) model, which trained computer performance indicators as behavior-based dynamic analysis techniques.

The government expected that housing stability would be achieved by introducing the price ceiling system, but there was a constant controversy over the effect of it. Some experts argued that the price ceiling system does not affect existing housing prices, but rather reduces housing supply, which increases price in the long run. In this study, we intend to analyze the impact of the price ceiling system on housing market forecast by predicting housing market based on the presence or absence of the price ceiling system and comparing the accuracy. Several previous research have studied the factors affecting housing price, but this only identified the correlation, and there was insufficient of research on housing price prediction according to actual policy. To overcome such statistical limitations, this paper predicts housing price using machine learning that can be interpreted with high accuracy even if input variables are incomplete, wide, or irregular. As a result of analysis, the difference between RMSE(Root Mean Error), error rate mean, and error rate standard deviation was insignificant even if the price ceiling system was applied or not. This means that the housing market is more affected by other factors than the price ceiling system."

As machine learning and deep learning technologies developed, more studies were conducted. Among the images, artworks in particular are very related to emotions. In general, artists often put their emotions into their works. Emotions are controlled by artistic features such as symmetry and composition, which combine physical elements such as color and texture. In this study, these features are extracted and analyzed from paintings. Features that are expected to affect emotions in paintings are extracted and used to predict emotions. Various machine learning models are built by extracted physical features such as color, line, texture, etc. and artistic features such as symmetry and color combination from a given painting. Through the built machine learning models, this paper analyze which machine learning models are suitable for the most relevant characteristics and emotional extraction in conversation-emotional predictions. Finally, we verify the legitimacy and accuracy of machine learning models by comparing them with predictive models based on deep learning."

Parameters are changed by using the gradient-based method of the cost function. The more complex the digital signal and the more complex the problem to be learned, the more complex and deeper the structure of the artificial neural network. Such a complex and deep neural network structure can cause over-fitting problems. In order to avoid over-fitting, a weight decay regularization method of parameters is used. We additionally use the value of the cost function in this method. In this way, the accuracy of machine learning is improved, and the superiority is confirmed through numerical experiments.

The Korea Forest Service attempted to quantify the soil creep susceptible areas using a discriminant value table to prevent or mitigate casualties and/or property damages in advance. With the advent of advanced computer technologies, machine learning-based classification models have been employed for managing mountainous disasters, such as landslides and debris flows. This study aims to quantify the soil creep susceptibility using several classifiers, namely the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. To develop the classification models, we downscaled 292 data from 4,618 field survey data. About 70% of the selected data were used for training, with the remaining 30% used for model testing. The developed models have the classification accuracy of 0.727 for k-NN, 0.750 for NB, 0.807 for RF, and 0.750 for SVM against test datasets representing 30% of the total data. Furthermore, we estimated Cohen's Kappa index as 0.534, 0.580, 0.673, and 0.585, with AUC values of 0.872, 0.912, 0.943, and 0.834, respectively. The machine learning-based classifications for soil creep susceptibility were RF, NB, SVM, and k-NN in that order.

To reduce such adverse impacts, it is necessary to have spatially continuous fog risk information. In this work, tree-based machine-learning models were developed in order to quantify fog risks with routine meteorological observations alone. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting (LGB), and Random Forests (RF) were chosen for the regional fog models using operational weather and visibility observations within the Jeollabuk-do province. Results showed that RF seemed to show the most robust performance to categorize between fog and non-fog situations during the training and evaluation period of 2017-2019. While the LGB performed better than in predicting fog occurrences than the others, its false alarm ratio was the highest (0.695) among the three models. The predictability of the three models considerably declined when applying them for an independent period of 2020, potentially due to the distinctively enhanced air quality in the year under the global lockdown. Nonetheless, even in 2020, the three models were all able to produce fog risk information consistent with the spatial variation of observed fog occurrences. This work suggests that the tree-based machine learning models could be used as tools to find locations with relatively high fog risks."

This study proposes a method that can compensate for the reduction in traffic prediction accuracy in traffic incidents situations by hybrid approach of machine learning and traffic simulation. The blind spots of the data-driven method are revealed when data patterns that have not been observed in the past are recognized. In this study, we tried to solve the problem by reinforcing historical data using traffic simulation. The proposed method performs machine learning-based traffic prediction and periodically compares the prediction result with real time traffic data to determine whether an incident occurs. When an incident is recognized, prediction is performed using the synthetic traffic data generated through simulation. The method proposed in this study was tested on an actual road section, and as a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the error in predicting traffic state in incident situations was significantly reduced. The proposed traffic prediction method is expected to become a cornerstone for the advancement of traffic prediction."

The principles have indeed been actively discussed over the past few decades in the field of mathematical and quantitative psychology. The essence of the discussion is as follows: 1) candidate models are to be considered not the true model but approximating models, 2) discrepancy between a candidate model and the true model will not disappear even in the population, and therefore 3) it would be best to select the approximating model exhibiting the smallest discrepancy with the true model. The discrepancy between the true model and a candidate model estimated in the sample has been referred to as overall discrepancy in quantitative psychology. In the field of machine learning, models are assessed in light of the extent to which performance of a model is generalizable to the new unseen samples, without being limited to the training samples. In machine learning, a model’s ability to generalize is referred to as the generalization error or prediction error. The present article elucidates the point that the principle of model assessment based on overall discrepancy advocated in quantitative psychology is identical to the model assessment principle based on generalization/prediction error firmly adopted in machine learning. Another objective of the present article is to help readers appreciate the fact that questionable data analytic practices widely tolerated in psychology, such as HARKing (Kerr, 1998) and QRP (Simmons et al., 2011), have been likely causes of the problem known as overfitting in individual studies, which in turn, have collectively resulted in the recent debates over replication crisis in psychology. As a remedy against the questionable practices, this article reintroduces cross-validation methods, whose initial discussion dates back at least to the 1950s in psychology (Mosier, 1951), by couching them in terms of estimators of the generalization/prediction error in the hope of reducing the overfitting problems in psychological research."

Due to sporadic demand nature of railroad car maintenance parts, the demand cannot be estimated by using normal approaches such as time-series analysis or multiple regression analysis. Therefore, we applied various machine learning methods and identified good estimators for them. Specifically, we classified maintenance parts into several clusters using K-means method based on average demand interval and coefficient of variation, which can be calculated for each item. Then, for each cluster, we identified a proper estimator by testing decision tree, random forest, and neural network. By adopting these results, we expect that we can improve the forecasting capability of the company and reduce the production lead time up to 40 to 60 days."

We prepared four combinations of alloys, Al-6wt%Si, Al-9wt%Si, Al-12wt%Si and Al-15wt%Si for machine learning. DCGAN is composed of a generator and a discriminator. The discriminator has a typical convolutional neural network (CNN), and the generator has an inverse shaped CNN. The fake images generated using DCGAN were similar to real microstructural images. However, they showed some strange morphology, including dendrites without directionality, and deformed Si crystals. Verification with Inception V3 revealed that the fake images generated using DCGAN were well classified into the target categories. Even the visually imperfect images in the initial training iterations showed high similarity to the target. It seems that the imperfect images had enough microstructural characteristics to satisfy the classification, even though human cannot recognize the images. Cross validation was carried out using real, fake and other test images.When the training dataset had the fake images only, the real and test images showed high similarities to the target categories. When the training dataset contained both the real and fake images, the similarity at the target categories were high enough to meet the right answers. We concluded that the DCGAN developed for microstructural images in this study is highly useful for data augmentation for rare microstructures."

In this study, genetic markersfor fisheries resources management were discovered based on genomic information, as part of the managementof endemic species in response to climate change. Two thousand one hundred and sixty one single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) were discovered using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) method. Forty-one SNPs were selectedbased on their features for species classification. Machine learning analysis using these SNPs makes it possible todifferentiate four Haliotis species and hybrids. In conclusion, the proposed machine learning method has potentialsfor species classification of the genus Haliotis. Our results will provide valuable data for biodiversity conservationand management of abalone population in Korea."

The purpose of this study is to devise a method for predicting drought using the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI), which represents a complex and difficult time series drought index using climate data for weather phenomena. The Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index is a method of calculating the cumulative precipitation by excluding the cumulative evaporation amount from the cumulative precipitation using precipitation and evapotranspiration data, and the evaporation amount is calculated using the monthly heat index method. The Meteorological Agency evaluated meteorological drought using SPI6, which is a 6-month cumulative precipitation standard, and applied it to machine learning based on monthly data and daily data SPEI6 in this study.

The dataset consists of four units of argumentation features and argumentation levels for episodes. We utilized argumentation clusters and n-gram to enhance automated scoring accuracy. We used the three supervised learning algorithms resulting in 33 automatic scoring models. As a result of automated scoring, we got a good scoring accuracy of 77.59% on average and up to 85.37%. In this process, we found that argumentation cluster patterns could enhance automated scoring performance accuracy. Then, we analyzed argumentation patterns using the model of decision tree and random forest. Our results were consistent with the previous research in which justification in coordination with claim and evidence determines scientific argumentation quality.

Although ground stations to monitor NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in real time are operated in Korea, they have a limitation that it is difficult to analyze the spatial distribution of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, especially over the areas with no stations. Therefore, this study conducted a comparative experiment of spatial interpolation of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations based on two linear-regression methods (i.e., multi linear regression (MLR), and regression kriging (RK)), and two machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR)) for the year of 2020. Four approaches were compared using leave-one-out-cross validation (LOOCV). The daily LOOCV results showed that MLR, RK, and SVR produced the average daily index of agreement (IOA) of 0.57, which was higher than that of RF (0.50). The average daily normalized root mean square error of RK was 0.9483%, which was slightly lower than those of the other models. MLR, RK and SVR showed similar seasonal distribution patterns, and the dynamic range of the resultant NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from these three models was similar while that from RF was relatively small. The multivariate linear regression approaches are expected to be a promising method for spatial interpolation of ground-level NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and other parameters in urban areas."

In particular, ground-level SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are closely related to human activities. Satellite observations such as TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument)- derived column density data can provide spatially continuous monitoring of ground-level SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. This study aims to propose a 2-step residual corrected model to estimate ground-level SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations through the synergistic use of satellite data and numerical model output. Random forest machine learning was adopted in the 2-step residual corrected model. The proposed model was evaluated through three cross-validations (i.e., random, spatial and temporal). The results showed that the model produced slopes of 1.14-1.25, R values of 0.55-0.65, and relative root-mean-square-error of 58-63%, which were improved by 10% for slopes and 3% for R and rRMSE when compared to the model without residual correction. The model performance by country was slightly reduced in Japan, often resulting in overestimation, where the sample size was small, and the concentration level was relatively low. The spatial and temporal distributions of SO<sub>2</sub> produced by the model agreed with those of the in-situmeasurements, especially over Yangtze River Delta in China and Seoul Metropolitan Area in South Korea, which are highly dependent on the characteristics of anthropogenic emission sources.

As the efficient market hypothesis introduced in the 1970s acquired supports, it came to be the majority opinion that it was impossible to predict stock prices. However, recent advances in predictive models have led to new attempts to predict the future prices. Here, we summarize past studies on the price prediction by evaluation measures, and predict the direction of stock prices of Samsung Electronics, LG Chem, and NAVER by applying various machine learning models. In addition to widely used technical indicator variables, accounting indicators such as Price Earning Ratio and Price Book-value Ratio and outputs of the hidden Markov Model are used as predictors. From the results of our analysis, we conclude that no models show significantly better accuracy and it is not possible to predict the direction of stock prices with models used. Considering that the models with extra predictors show relatively high test accuracy, we may expect the possibility of a meaningful improvement in prediction accuracy if proper variables that reflect the opinions and sentiments of investors would be utilized."

However, the conventional method of measuring the concentration of suspended solids is labor-intensive, and it is difficult to obtain a vast amount of data via point measurement. Therefore, in this study, a model for measuring the concentration of suspended solids based on remote sensing in the Nakdong River was developed using Sentinel-2 data that provides high-resolution multi-spectral satellite images. The proposed model considers the spectral bands and band ratios of various wavelength bands using a machine learning model, Support Vector Regression (SVR), to overcome the limitation of the existing remote sensing-based regression equations. The optimal combination of variables was derived using the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and weight coefficients for each variable of SVR. The results show that the 705nm band belonging to the red-edge wavelength band was estimated as the most important spectral band, and the proposed SVR model produced the most accurate measurement compared with the previous regression equations. By using the RFE, the SVR model developed in this study reduces the variable dependence compared to the existing regression equations based on the single spectral band or band ratio and provides more accurate prediction of spatial distribution of suspended solids concentration."

This study reviewed 36 articles of MLA with a coding scheme about research purposes, research contexts, learning elements, data collection and analysis, and limitations. This study found that MLA was mainly conducted to explore learning patterns and factors to influence learning outcomes. Adult learners were likely to participate in the research of MLA in well-controlled experiment contexts rather than authentic instructional ones. Many studies focused on cognitive and interactive elements of learning, whereas there was a lack of research on MLA for self-regulated learning. MLA studies collected web, audio, survey, eye tracking, physiological data, etc., and analyzed them mainly with statistical and classification analyses. The limitations of MLA were pointed out in regard to data collection and analysis (e.g., small sample size, data noise) rather than data usage and ethical problems. The findings imply that MLA can enhance an in-depth understanding of learning and learners because it reveals diverse aspects of learning that are not easily identified through traditional research methods.

It does not predict equipment failure with just one or two signs, but quantifies and models numerous symptoms and historical data of actual failure. Statistical methods were used a lot in the past as this predictive maintenance method, but recently, many machine learning-based methods have been proposed. Such proposed machine learning-based methods are preferable in that they show more accurate prediction performance. However, with the exception of some learning models such as decision tree-based models, it is very difficult to explicitly know the structure of learning models (Black-Box Model) and to explain to what extent certain attributes (features or variables) of the learning model affected the prediction results. To overcome this problem, a recently proposed study is an explainable artificial intelligence (AI). It is a methodology that makes it easy for users to understand and trust the results of machine learning-based learning models. In this paper, we propose an explainable AI method to further enhance the explanatory power of the existing learning model by targeting the previously proposedpredictive model [5] that learned data from a core facility (Hyper Compressor) of a domestic chemical plant that produces polyethylene. The ensemble prediction model, which is a black box model, wasconverted to a white box model using the Explainable AI. The proposed methodology explains the direction of control for the major features in the failure prediction results through the Explainable AI.

The primary focus of such research is frequently concerned with the tool’s feasibility and usefulness in connection to language learning. However, in recent years, new proposals in the social sciences have emerged to redefine materials and objects beyond their long-held passive and static nature. Notable among them are a series of posthuman theories, including new materialism, which argue that the traditional understanding of matter and tools fails to adequately reflect their ontological position of acting and becoming by reducing them to objects for human use. This article proposes new onto-epistemologies of machine translation in language learning, based on recent theoretical discourse in new materialism research. To this goal, new materialist theories in regard to objects, machines, and devices are reviewed. Also, works of applied linguists, Alastair Pennycook, Kelleen Toohey, and Suresh Canagarajah, who have pioneered the new materialist turn, are introduced.

Particularly, a flood forecasting and warning system has been recognized as an important nonstructural measure for flood damage reduction, including loss of life. Flood forecasting and warning have been performed by the forecasts of flood discharge and flood stage using the physically based rainfall-runoff models. However, recently, studies involving the application of a machine learning-based flood forecasting models, which addresses the limitations of extant physically based flood stage forecasting models, have been performed. We may require various case studies to determine more accurate methods. Therefore, this study performed the real-time forecasting of the river water level or stage at the Gurye station of the Sumjin river with lead times of 1, 3, and 6 h by applying a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep learning model. In addition, the applicability of the LSTM model was evaluated by comparing the results with those from widely used models based on support vector machine and multilayer perceptron. Consequently, we noted that the LSTM model exhibited a relatively better forecasting performance. Therefore, the applicability of the LSTM model should be extensively studied for flood forecasting applications."

Thus, rapid estimations of the area of lodged rice are necessary to enable timely responses to damage. To this end, we obtained images related to rice lodging using a drone in Gimje, Buan, and Gunsan, which were converted to 128 × 128 pixels images. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a deep learning model based on these images, was used to predict rice lodging, which was classified into two types (lodging and non-lodging), and the images were divided in a 8:2 ratio into a training set and a validation set. The CNN model was layered and trained using three optimizers (Adam, Rmsprop, and SGD). The area of rice lodging was evaluated for the three fields using the obtained data, with the exception of the training set and validation set. The images were combined to give composites images of the entire fields using Metashape, and these images were divided into 128 × 128 pixels. Lodging in the divided images was predicted using the trained CNN model, and the extent of lodging was calculated by multiplying the ratio of the total number of field images by the number of lodging images by the area of the entire field. The results for the training and validation sets showed that accuracy increased with a progression in learning and eventually reached a level greater than 0.919. The results obtained for each of the three fields showed high accuracy with respect to all optimizers, among which, Adam showed the highest accuracy (normalized root mean square error: 2.73%). On the basis of the findings of this study, it is anticipated that the area of lodged rice can be rapidly predicted using deep learning."

To interpret real data with the model trained by synthetic data, the synthetic data used for training should be geologically realistic. In this study, we introduce a method to generate realistic synthetic seismic data. Initially, reflectivity models are generated to include realistic fault structures, and then, a one-way wave equation is applied to efficiently generate seismic stack sections. Next, a migration algorithm is used to remove diffraction artifacts and random noise is added to mimic actual field data.

We propose a model that describes the process of human noise recognition at three stages of detection, memory, and recognition.

We use noise data from multiple locations measured by an acoustic camera that measures and shapes the sound at a specific location using a beamforming technique. Finally, numerical examples are given for verifying the algorithm presented in this paper. In addition, interior noise data is visualized using autoencoder, tSNE, and PCA in unsupervised feature learning. Since the algorithm presented is unsupervised learning, it is unnecessary to build large-scale training data.

Having said that, even the most advanced technology is not able to translate precisely without post-editing.This study analyzed Chinese-to-Korean translation works from 50 students at a University. 29 of them were beginner-level while the rest were intermediate-level. They were asked to translate parts of children’s picture books by editing the translation results from two most popular translation apps: Google Translate and Naver Papago. The most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that beginner-level students were more frequent to adopt translation contents without any editing. A possible explanation for this might be that beginner-level students felt difficulties in understanding the source text in Chinese. From their learning reflection, the most common words from the beginner-level students were ‘too much/overloading’ and ‘difficult’. In addition to the same term ‘difficult’, intermediate-level students emphasized on ‘naturally’ and ‘translating’."

Uploading a video that includes not only yourself but also people around you can cause infringement of portrait rights and privacy issues. In general, The portrait rights of others are protected by manually blurring faces of people moving over time using a video editing program. However, this is a very cumbersome task and the existing automatic mosaic system also has limitations because it does not detect all identifiable faces properly in videos and it misses tracked faces frequently. Therefore, to prevent the problem of infringement of portrait rights, this paper proposes a portrait rights protection system using deep learning. The system uses YOLOv3, Face-Net, and SORT algorithm to protect the portrait rights by blurring faces of other people except the users registered in the system. Compared to the existing automatic mosaic system, It can detect all identifiable faces and blur faces more accurately. It can operate in real-time by skipping a certain frame and performing face verification. It is also possible to flexibly respond to various changes of the face reflected on the camera by applying the SORT object tracking algorithm. The proposed system can improve convenience for users by automating the task of manually blurring faces of people and it shows superior performance compared to the existing automatic mosaic system."

That point of view has drastically changed on different levels in just a decade. Nowadays cosmetic formulators should unavoidably meet the needs of consumers who want sensory satisfaction, although they do not have much time for new product development. The selection of new products from candidate products largely depend on the panel of human sensory experts. As new product development cycle time decreases, the formulators wanted to find systematic tools that are required to filter candidate products into a short list. Traditional statistical analysis on most physical property tests for the products including tribology tests and rheology tests, do not give any sound foundation for filtering candidate products. In this paper, we suggest a deep learning-based analysis method to identify hand cream products by raw electric signals from tribological sliding test. We compare the result of the deep learning-based method using raw data as input with the results of several machine learning-based analysis methods using manually extracted features as input. Among them, ResNet that is a deep learning model proved to be the best method to identify hand cream used in the test. According to our search in the scientific reported papers, this is the first attempt for predicting test cosmetic product with only raw time-series friction data without any manual feature extraction. Automatic product identification capability without manually extracted features can be used to narrow down the list of the newly developed candidate products."

Therefore, automatic detection of the steel surface defects plays a vital role in the steel manufacturing process. For the defect detection, machine learning based classification methods have been widely used such as HAAR feature-based cascade classifiers and support vector machines (SVM). As deep learning methods have been popular, the neural network based surface defect detection has been recently introduced. As for the methods, many researchers, in general, adopt a trained neural network, which is mainly winner in the recent ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge). Then, the weights and last layers are modified to be used for surface defect detection (SDD), which is called transfer learning. In the previous researches, ResNet152 (winner in ILSVRC 2015) was used and the resulting performances were F1=0.975 and F1=0.912 in two different studies, respectively. However, the neural network used in their research has very wide and deep. Therefore, huge memories to save the trained weights and many multiplier–accumulators (MAC) are necessary, which means expensive hardware systems are essential to predict surface defect on the steel surface. This paper suggests a small neural network dedicated to surface defect detection. The proposed network has only three convolution layers and two fully connected layers.

It was attempted to provide a more detailed understanding about the possibility of future changes in North Korea by tracking changes in North Korea’s perceptions of South Korea and its perceptions of peace and threats. As a result, the main threat was the US for North Korea’s perspective, and it was also confirmed that South Korea could be perceived as a threat by insulting on the dignity of the supreme leader-Kim Jongeun. The fact whether South Korea’s governments consist of progressive or conservative party doesn’t seem to have significant impacts on North Korea’s perception. Expectations for improvement in inter-Korean relations in 2018 are highly likely to have been perceived by North Korea as an escape from the crisis through the ease of economic sanctions. The reason is that North Korea’s perception about the threat has returned to the same level as before after the severance of US-DPRK dialogue, and it could be revealed by ordering slogans for domestic economic development.

To enhance the effectiveness of video lectures, instructors should predict students’ learning outcomes and provide learning supports at the right time. Recently, multimodal learning analytics has been developed in order to accurately predict learning outcomes using diverse learning data like psychophysiological measures. Nevertheless, there is a lack of research on whether a prediction model is generalizable across diverse learning contexts using different instructional methods. This research intends to explore the influence of metacognitive support on the prediction model of learning outcomes in video lectures. A total of 33 learners were randomly assigned to metacognitive support (n=17) and non-support (n=16) groups, and they individually studied video lectures of the osmotic pressure in the human body for 40 minutes. This study recorded the learning process with video, measured skin conductance responses with a wristband, collected the data of cognitive load using a survey, and conducted pre- and post-tests. Using the data collected, machine learning algorithms generated models to predict high- and low-achievement groups, and an optimal prediction model was selected through evaluating the performance of the models. This study found that the optimal prediction model of the metacognitive support group was different from that of the non-support group. In the non-support group, metacognitive activities and arousal levels measured by skin conductance responses were included in the optimal prediction model, whereas cognitive load and prior knowledge were included in the optimal prediction model of the metacognitive support group. This study shows that instructional methods like metacognitive support can significantly influence predicting learning outcomes in video lectures, so prediction models should be carefully applied to novel learning contexts."

Especially, due to the rapidly changing business environments and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many domestic companies are facing financial adversity. Thus, the necessity of research on corporate insolvency is being emphasized. As a related research, there is a prediction of corporate bankruptcy, however, a bankrupt company is the company whose business activities have been suspended, and there is a limitation in which it is inappropriate to determine which companies show signs of bankruptcy among continuing companies. Therefore, marginal company, one of the categories of insolvent companies, is selected as the prediction target. Marginal companies are the firms that are operating income interest compensation ratio are less than 1 for three consecutive years, and are engaged in business activities but have not consistently secured adequate profits. In this study, deep learning techniques are used to predict them. It is one of the machine learning techniques that has recently attracted attention because of its excellence in various fields. Nonetheless, has not been applied in research to predict marginal companies. This study applies RNN and CNN among deep learning techniques using several financial ratios as independent variables. Their performance are compared with machine learning ensemble models that have been reported to have excellent predictive power in previous studies. As a result of analysis on corporate data from 2017 to 2019 as training and test data, deep learning models such as RNN-LSTM, RNN-GRU, and CNN are better in forecasting of marginal companies than the ensemble models in terms of Recall score. Therefore, the deep learning models are expected to become widely used in the prediction of marginal companies in the future."

When subcontracting contracts are concluded among small and medium-sized enterprises, 58.2% of them do not apply standard contracts and sign contracts that have not undergone legal review. In order to support small and medium-sized enterprises fair and legitimate contracts, small and medium-sized enterprises can be protected from legal threats if they can reduce the risk of signing contracts by analyzing various risks in the contract and analyzing and informing them of toxic clauses and omitted contracts in advance. We propose a risk prediction model for the machine reading-based legal contract to minimize legal damage to small and medium-sized business owners in the legal blind spots. We have established our own set of legal questions and answers based on the legal data disclosed for the purpose of building a model specialized in legal contracts.

Recently, the machine learning based approach is being actively conducted for improving recognition accuracy. In this approach, a deep neural network is trained using a sound dataset, and then the actual sound is applied to identify the sound category. In the identification stage, the recognition accuracy of the machine learning is degraded due to the ambient noise. In other words, unlike the experimental environment, various sounds are input into the microphone along with the target sound. Since these ambient sounds are not trained, they could lower the classification performance. However, there are only a few research results on the relation between the noise and the recognition performance despite of the practical importance. In this paper, we study the performance degradation of sound classification in the space where the music is playing with considering the music genre and the volume level. For this, we use CNN, UrbanSound8K dataset consisting of 10 kinds of environmental sounds, and GTZAN data set containing 10 kinds of music genres. First, CNN is trained to recognize the sounds of UrbanSound8K, and then five songs for each genre were selected from GTZAN and mixed to the UrbanSound8K so that the signal-to-noise ratio are -20dB, 0dB, 5dB, 10dB, and 20dB. Then we test the accuracy with the mixed sound input and compare with the noise-free target sound. As a result, there is 2.8% to 22% difference in the recognition accuracy by music genre and sound level. The result show that the SNR should be 20dB or more in order for music not to have a significant effect on the recognition accuracy."

However, humans have created an artificial moral agent(AMA) that acts concern for morality. This is a huge problem. The technology is well ahead of the AI ethics, and our current AI ethics can't cope with all these changes. Therefore I believe that an ethics commission must be established to oversee the development of this powerful new technology, especially in the area of education. Children are vulnerable and need our protection against amoral agents in the AI arena.In addition to the role of AI as a tool for learning, AI ethics should be a part of any education curriculum. First, the study should explore machine ethics and the task of implementing ethical behavior. Second, the task of implementing machine ethics in neuroethics is analyzed. Third, we should research possible ethical standards. Fourth, children should be educated about the opportunities and moral hazards of AI. We could create AMA to be a simple artificial agent. AI ethics should therefore be an integral part of future education programs with a special focus on early childhood psychological development. Programmers and computer engineers should avoid errors due to the AMA design that overlooked the complexity of moral character. We should deal with machine ethics for elementary students."

The demand for integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning workflows into the pipeline has been increasing lately by the VFX industries which are in search of and in need of training professionals with new skills and expertise in the area of AI and machine learning. Based on this research, a curriculum aimed at training technical directors (TD) to utilize artificial intelligence applications in pipelines and manage projects has been devised to fulfill such demand.  As the popularity of OTT platforms has recently exploded and cutting-edge technologies that implement virtual reality have developed rapidly, VFX industries are on a constant lookout for TDs who can integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies into the existing VFX pipelines. In addition to the film and animation industry, the broadcasting industry is also paying close attention to real-time content development to prepare for 5G and Metaverse revolution. Demand for TDs that are skilled at artificial intelligence and machine learning is expected to increase as artificial intelligence and machine learning workflows are seen as key competencies to increase productivity and creativity in these future media industries.  This is a research paper proposes the NCS-based curriculum developed for training TD personnel to meet the trends for both VFX industry and the higher education. Analysis and literature research on the fields of film and VFX were conducted, and the curriculum was developed with advice from task-specific field experts (SMEs). The curriculum developed through this study was proposed by Hongik University’s Sejong Campus Industry-Academic Cooperation Group and the Korea Design Promotion Agency as the “AI-Based VFX Compositing and Machine Learning” which was included in their 2020 Industry-led Youth Customized Training Projects. The Curriculum was reviewed by the Design and Cultural Content Industry Human Resource Developing Committee and approved for 2021 course.  For the efficacy of the course to take place amid Corvid-19 pandemic in which video conference training has become a norm, this curriculum has been developed in the form of blended training by servicing software and training exercise via cloud computing. Even after the pandemic is put to an end, the blended work is expected to be introduced throughout the working place. Thus providing students with opportunities to improve adaptability to the future working environment is expected to increase efficiency in developing Human Resources and training for VFX industries."

In Korea, the introduction or use of such algorithms has not yet been in full swing, but prior to full-scale introduction, it is necessary to preemptively examine various problems of risk prediction by artificial intelligence algorithms. Artificial intelligence algorithms used in the private sector's legal services do not replace the decision-making of legal experts such as lawyers, but rather assist lawyers and enhance the capabilities of lawyers. It is not properly addressed in this paper because it’s legal issue is small, and focuses on the algorithm for predicting the risk of recidivism and the predictive security algorithm, which are mainly used in criminal proceedings.The tool to measure the likelihood of a criminal violating the law again, that is, the risk of recidivism, was first used in the 1930s to determine the prisoners to be released on parole, and is gradually being used to determine the sentence at the time of sentencing. This tool is a type of regression analysis model that uses race, ethnicity, education, and intelligence as predictors.With the recent rise of machine learning algorithms, new risk assessment tools that apply machine learning algorithms on top of the basic principles of existing recidivism risk measurement tools have been developed one after another. What is common in these risk assessment tools is to take as input variables several factors that are thought to have an influence on recidivism, and use the complex computational power of machine learning algorithms to calculate recidivism's risk score.All of the recent risk prediction tools use artificial intelligence algorithms, and among them, machine learning algorithms are frequently used. As the name suggests, machine learning learns using enormous amounts of data and performs tasks assigned with improved performance. The learning function operates even in the user's use process, and when machine learning algorithms are used, the performance gradually improves. However, as the prediction results are biased and differentiating problems arise, they are surrounded by harsh criticism.A widely used predictive security algorithm along with the recidivism risk assessment tool predicts when and where a crime will occur using crime data and machine learning. The predictive policing algorithm, called the crime prediction algorithm, is based on the idea that analyzing existing data on past crimes can predict when and where new crimes are most likely to occur. Based on the fact that certain types of crime tend to cluster in time and space, we predict where the crime will occur in the future based on the criminal record maintained by the police and the recent crime area. This algorithm has long been used for the deployment of police patrol personnel in more than 60 cities in the United States, including Atlanta and Los Angeles, and is evaluated as contributing greatly to lowering the crime rate. However, due to the manipulation of criminal statistics, there are my flaws in the data used in the machine learning algorithm, and the risk of crime in the region where the past crime occurred is overestimated due to the prejudice inherent in the data. The prejudice inherent in the data is not only a problem of accuracy, but also a problem of racial discrimination.In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to acknowledge the error of the algorithm and find a way to solve it. In addition, it is necessary to recognize the importance of the integrity of the data used in the algorithm, and make considerable effort to collect and clean the data.In addition, as it is mainly used in criminal proceedings, it is necessary to make efforts to harmonize with efficient law enforcement by placing importance on the aspects of ensuring fairness of the procedure and ensuring due process."

The proposed algorithm consists of four processes: network classification origin setting process, feature vector extraction process, feature noise removal process, and class classification process. First, in the process of setting the network classification starting point, the division starting point of the network structure for effective feature vector extraction is set. Second, in the feature vector extraction process, feature vectors are extracted without additional learning using the weights previously learned. Third, in the feature noise removal process, the extracted feature vector is received and the output value of each class is learned to remove noise from the data. Fourth, in the class classification process, the noise-removed feature vector is input to the multi-layer perceptron structure, and the result is output and learned. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we experimented with the Extended Yale B face database. As a result of the experiment, in the case of the time required for one-time learning, the proposed algorithm reduced 40.7% based on the existing algorithm.

Despite their predictive performances, the acknowledged drawback of ML techniques is their lack of interpretable features that can be used to evaluate policy impacts. In this sense, this article aims to not only develop discrete choice modeling using ML techniques but also provide the useful insights about demystifying (i.e., interpreting) ML models. In particular, XGBoost, rule-based ensemble model combined with ML, is adopted to predict and understand mode choice behaviors related to Korea-Japan undersea tunnel high-speed train. XGBoost model notably possesses more interpretable algorithmic features than other ML models as well as high degree of predictive power for multi-level data—e.g., stated preference (SP) survey. Overall model estimates were accurated at 81% and also presented high accuracy for each model choice. To interpret users’ behaviors and preferences, variable importance (VI), variable contribution, and interactive partial dependence were estimated. The results of VI indicates that air mode, for instance, was affected by order of air fare, Fukuoka visit frequency, and Japan visit frequency, ferry mode was affected by order of Age, Willing to use tunnel, and Japan visit by air mode, and train mode was affected by train fare, age, and Japan visit frequency."

However, real-world data contains missing values for various reasons, which degrades the performance of prediction models learned from the poor training data. Therefore, in order to build a high-performance model from real-world datasets, many studies on automatically imputing missing values in initial training data have been actively conducted. Many of conventional machine learning-based imputation techniques for handling missing data involve very time-consuming and cumbersome work because they are applied only to numeric type of columns or create individual predictive models for each columns. Therefore, this paper proposes a new data imputation technique called ‘Denoising Self-Attention Network (DSAN)’, which can be applied to mixed-type dataset containing both numerical and categorical columns. DSAN can learn robust feature expression vectors by combining self-attention and denoising techniques, and can automatically interpolate multiple missing variables in parallel through multi-task learning. To verify the validity of the proposed technique, data imputation experiments has been performed after arbitrarily generating missing values for several mixed-type training data. Then we show the validity of the proposed technique by comparing the performance of the binary classification models trained on imputed data together with the errors between the original and imputed values."

Automatic Classification of the Korean Triage Acuity Scale in Simulated Emergency Rooms Using Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing: a Proof of Concept Study,2021,"['Triage', 'Classification', 'Machine Learning', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Deep Learning']",,"Background: Rapid triage reduces the patients' stay time at an emergency department (ED). The Korean Triage Acuity Scale (KTAS) is mandatorily applied at EDs in South Korea.For rapid triage, we studied machine learning-based triage systems composed of a speech recognition model and natural language processing-based classification.Methods: We simulated 762 triage cases that consisted of 18 classes with six types of the main symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, fever, stroke, abdominal pain, and headache) and three levels of KTAS. In addition, we recorded conversations between emergency patients and clinicians during the simulation. We used speech recognition models to transcribe the conversation.Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) were used for KTAS and symptom classification. Additionally, we evaluated the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values of features to interpret the classifiers.Results: The character error rate of the speech recognition model was reduced to 25.21% through transfer learning. With auto-transcribed scripts, support vector machine (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–0.9), KNN (AUROC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85–0.93), RF (AUROC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.9) and BERT (AUROC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.87) achieved excellent classification performance.Based on SHAP, we found “stress”, “pain score point”, “fever”, “breath”, “head” and “chest” were the important vocabularies for determining KTAS and symptoms.Conclusion: We demonstrated the potential of an automatic KTAS classification system using speech recognition models, machine learning and BERT-based classifiers."

When we decide to buy products online, we read anonymous reviews and buy them. With the advent of the Data-driven era, IT technologys development is spilling out many data from individuals to objects. Companies or individuals have accumulated, processed, and analyzed such a large amount of data that they can now make decisions or execute directly using data that used to depend on experts. Nowadays, the recommender system plays a vital role in determining the users preferences to purchase goods and uses a recommender system to induce clicks on web services (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Youtube). For example, Youtubes recommender system, which is used by 1 billion people worldwide every month, includes videos that users like, like and videos they watched. Recommended system research is deeply linked to practical business. Therefore, many researchers are interested in building better solutions. Recommender systems use the information obtained from their users to generate recommendations because the development of the provided recommender systems requires information on items that are likely to be preferred by the user. We began to trust patterns and rules derived from data rather than empirical intuition through the recommender systems. The capacity and development of data have led machine learning to develop deep learning. However, such recommender systems are not all solutions. Proceeding with the recommender systems, there should be no scarcity in all data and a sufficient amount. Also, it requires detailed information about the individual. The recommender systems work correctly when these conditions operate. The recommender systems become a complex problem for both consumers and sellers when the interaction log is insufficient. Because the sellers perspective needs to make recommendations at a personal level to the consumer and receive appropriate recommendations with reliable data from the consumers perspective.  In this paper, to improve the accuracy problem for appropriate recommendation to consumers, the recommender systems are proposed in combination with context-based deep learning. This research is to combine user-based data to create hybrid Recommender Systems. The hybrid approach developed is not a collaborative type of Recommender Systems, but a collaborative extension that integrates user data with deep learning. Customer review data were used for the data set. Consumers buy products in online shopping malls and then evaluate product reviews. Rating reviews are based on reviews from buyers who have already purchased, giving users confidence before purchasing the product. However, the recommendation system mainly uses scores or ratings rather than reviews to suggest items purchased by many users. In fact, consumer reviews include product opinions and user sentiment that will be spent on evaluation. By incorporating these parts into the study, this paper aims to improve the recommendation system. This study is an algorithm used when individuals have difficulty in selecting an item. Consumer reviews and record patterns made it possible to rely on recommendations appropriately. The algorithm implements a recommendation system through collaborative filtering. This studys predictive accuracy is measured by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Netflix is strategically using the referral system in its programs through competitions that reduce RMSE every year, making fair use of predictive accuracy. Research on hybrid recommender systems combining the NLP approach for personalization recommender systems, deep learning base, etc. has been increasing.

The forage yield prediction model was developed using the DeepCrossing (R2=0.5442, RMSE=0.1769) technique of the highest accuracy among machine learning techniques.

Although on-demand production companies also want to reduce corporate risks such as delays in delivery by predicting total production time for orders, they are having difficulty predicting this because the total production time is all different for each order. The Theory of Constraints (TOC) theory was developed to find the least efficient areas to increase order throughput and reduce order total cost, but failed to provide a forecast of total production time. Order production varies from order to order due to various customer needs, so the total production time of individual orders can be measured postmortem, but it is difficult to predict in advance. The total measured production time of existing orders is also different, which has limitations that cannot be used as standard time. As a result, experienced managers rely on persimmons rather than on the use of the system, while inexperienced managers use simple management indicators (e.g., 60 days total production time for raw materials, 90 days total production time for steel plates, etc.). Too fast work instructions based on imperfections or indicators cause congestion, which leads to productivity degradation, and too late leads to increased production costs or failure to meet delivery dates due to emergency processing. Failure to meet the deadline will result in compensation for delayed compensation or adversely affect business and collection sectors. In this study, to address these problems, an entity that operates an order production system seeks to find a machine learning model that estimates the total production time of new orders. It uses orders, production, and process performance for materials used for machine learning. We compared and analyzed OLS, GLM Gamma, Extra Trees, and Random Forest algorithms as the best algorithms for estimating total production time and present the results."

It is essential to develop a methodology for the localization and mass estimation of loose parts owing to the high prediction error of conventional methods. An effective approach is presented for the localization and mass estimation of a loose part using machine-learning and deep-learning algorithms. First, a methodology was developed to estimate both the impact location and the mass of a loose part at the same times in a real structure in which geometric changes exist. Second, an impact database was constructed through a series of impact finite-element analyses (FEAs). Then, impact parameter prediction modes were generated for localization and mass estimation of a simulated metallic loose part using machine-learning algorithms (artificial neural network, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) and a deep-learning algorithm (convolutional neural network). The usefulness of the methodology was validated through blind tests, and the noise effect of the training data was also investigated. The high performance obtained in this study shows that the proposed methodology using an FEA-based database and deep learning is useful for localization and mass estimation of loose parts on site."

Recently, AI-based methods have received a lot of attention and so-called supervised learning methods that require classification information for data are mainly used. This supervised learning method requires a lot of time and costs because classification information (label) must be manually designated for all data required for learning. In this study, an autoencoder based on unsupervised learning was applied as an outlier detection to overcome this problem. For the experiment, two experiments were designed: one is univariate learning, in which only SST data was used among the observation data of Deokjeok Island and the other is multivariate learning, in which SST, air temperature, wind direction, wind speed, air pressure, and humidity were used. Period of data is 25 years from 1996 to 2020, and a pre-processing considering the characteristics of ocean data was applied to the data. An outlier detection of actual SST data was tried with a learned univariate and multivariate autoencoder. We tried to detect outliers in real SST data using trained univariate and multivariate autoencoders. To compare model performance, various outlier detection methods were applied to synthetic data with artificially inserted errors. As a result of quantitatively evaluating the performance of these methods, the multivariate/univariate accuracy was about 96%/91%, respectively, indicating that the multivariate autoencoder had better outlier detection performance. Outlier detection using an unsupervised learning-based autoencoder is expected to be used in various ways in that it can reduce subjective classification errors and cost and time required for data labeling."

In data design and data construction in the specialized domain area, it was decided that it could inherit the research results of existing dictionary studies. And researcher searched the structure and contents of semantic data, another artificial intelligence data to overcome the limitations of data for deep learning, and decided that the results of existing dictionaries could be fully utilized in ontology design and semantic data construction.Based on this, for practical case study, data for deep learning and semantic data through ontology design were experimentally constructed on the theme of Korean historical character dictionary. First, researcher constructed and experimented with the learning data of object name identification (NER) based on the annals data of the Joseon Dynasty using the object name identification (NER) method of deep learning. The problem that object identification of object name identification (NER) through deep learning only identifies the attribute of the object and does not recognize the uniqueness of the object is confirmed. Therefore, the possibility of semantic data was examined through experimental ontology design to build semantic data as knowledge that has various uniqueness through the relationship with the object’s time, space, and characters. In conclusion, if the concept and understanding of machine-readable data can be added in traditional dictionary studies, it is considered to be competitive enough in both deep learning data and semantic data through ontology."
ICT 인프라 이상탐지를 위한 조건부 멀티모달 오토인코더에 관한 연구,2021,"['이상탐지', '멀티모달', '인공지능', '오토인코더', '시스템 모니터링', 'Anomaly detection', 'Multimodal', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Autoencoder', 'System monitoring']",,"Maintenance and prevention of failure through anomaly detection of ICT infrastructure is becoming important. System monitoring data is multidimensional time series data. When we deal with multidimensional time series data, we have difficulty in considering both characteristics of multidimensional data and characteristics of time series data.  When dealing with multidimensional data, correlation between variables should be considered. Existing methods such as probability and linear base, distance base, etc. are degraded due to limitations called the curse of dimensions. In addition, time series data is preprocessed by applying sliding window technique and time series decomposition for self-correlation analysis. These techniques are the cause of increasing the dimension of data, so it is necessary to supplement them.  The anomaly detection field is an old research field, and statistical methods and regression analysis were used in the early days. Currently, there are active studies to apply machine learning and artificial neural network technology to this field.  Statistically based methods are difficult to apply when data is non-homogeneous, and do not detect local outliers well. The regression analysis method compares the predictive value and the actual value after learning the regression formula based on the parametric statistics and it detects abnormality. Anomaly detection using regression analysis has the disadvantage that the performance is lowered when the model is not solid and the noise or outliers of the data are included. There is a restriction that learning data with noise or outliers should be used.  The autoencoder using artificial neural networks is learned to output as similar as possible to input data. It has many advantages compared to existing probability and linear model, cluster analysis, and map learning. It can be applied to data that does not satisfy probability distribution or linear assumption. In addition, it is possible to learn non-mapping without label data for teaching. However, there is a limitation of local outlier identification of multidimensional data in anomaly detection, and there is a problem that the dimension of data is greatly increased due to the characteristics of time series data.  In this study, we propose a CMAE (Conditional Multimodal Autoencoder) that enhances the performance of anomaly detection by considering local outliers and time series characteristics. First, we applied Multimodal Autoencoder (MAE) to improve the limitations of local outlier identification of multidimensional data. Multimodals are commonly used to learn different types of inputs, such as voice and image. The different modal shares the bottleneck effect of Autoencoder and it learns correlation. In addition, CAE (Conditional Autoencoder) was used to learn the characteristics of time series data effectively without increasing the dimension of data. In general, conditional input mainly uses category variables, but in this study, time was used as a condition to learn periodicity.  The CMAE model proposed in this paper was verified by comparing with the Unimodal Autoencoder (UAE) and Multi-modal Autoencoder (MAE). The restoration performance of Autoencoder for 41 variables was confirmed in the proposed model and the comparison model. The restoration performance is different by variables, and the restoration is normally well operated because the loss value is small for Memory, Disk, and Network modals in all three Autoencoder models. The process modal did not show a significant difference in all three models, and the CPU modal showed excellent performance in CMAE. ROC curve was prepared for the evaluation of anomaly detection performance in the proposed model and the comparison model, and AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were compared. In all indicators, the performance was shown in the order of CMAE, MAE, and AE. Especially, the reproduction rate was 0.9828 for CMAE, which ca"

From this point of view, the researcher tried to find and present a case of developing knowledge and information processing capabilities through Chinese character education using AI (Artificial Intelligence) for students in Classical Chinese AI (Artificial Intelligence) at S Middle School in the first semester of 2021. The researcher first conducted Classical Chinese education using the artificial intelligence functions of the mblock program, namely converting text to speech, translation, recognition service, and machine learning. In translation, it was used for translation between Korean and Classical Chinese, and in recognition services, language sound recognition was used to recognize Korean or Classical Chinese, Language character recognition was used to recognize the shape of Chinese characters. Image recognition was used to recognize the shape of Chinese characters, image description was used to explain the image description related to Classical Chinese, and in machine learning, the shape of Chinese characters was used to machine learning. Next, Classical Chinese education was conducted to make personality artificial intelligence using the machine learning for kids program. In other words, Classical Chinese education was conducted using text to create artificial intelligence such as good deeds, evil deeds, filial piety, filial impiety, trust and distrust. With such Classical Chinese education, students have learned some cases of developing knowledge and information processing capabilities through Classical Chinese education using AI (Artificial Intelligence).

Deep Neural Network Structure Design for Equipment Failure Prediction in Smart Factory,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'Eeep Learning']",,"A smart factory is a system in which all equipment is connected through the Internet of Things (IoT) and all facilities are operated through a virtual physical system. In the factory, failure prediction for facilities maintenance combined with deep learning has recently attracted much attention to researchers. To perform deep learning-based prediction, a neural network model is built and trained using the learning dataset. The training performance varies depending on the structure of the constructed neural network design. In this study, an efficient design of a neural network is explored that is expected to have the best training performance using a dataset of vibration and temperature. To do this, different neural network models are implemented, and their performance was compared by evaluating loss, accuracy, and execution time. In the experiment, the neural network model was configured to have one input layer, two or three hidden layers, and one output layer, and performance metrics values were measured according to the internal node numbers in every hidden layer. Experimental results show that losses do not increase in spite of that node number becomes large. In general, as the structure of a deep neural network model is complex and the number of nodes inside it increases, it is expected that the loss value will be smaller. For accuracy, there was almost no significant difference between all models. In the case of execution time, it took more time as the number of internal nodes of the model increased."

Unlike single materials, the mechanical properties prediction of polymer matrix composites is difficult to explain with formulas because the mechanical behavior is complicated to be explained only by the relationship between the matrix and the filler. In this study, the stress-strain curve according to the composition of polymer matrix composites, which was difficult to predict due to its sensitivity to large plastic deformation and composition, was predicted based on machine learning of the test data. The developed model finds a complex correlation between matrix and filler types and compositions, and predicts the total stress-strain curve meaningfully even in the absence of learned test data. It is expected that the material design AI system can be completed in the future based on the developed model that predicts the mechanical properties of polymer matrix composites even for the combination and composition that have not been learned."

병렬 학습 모듈을 통한 자율무인잠수정의 강인한 위치 추정,2021,"['Learning', 'Localization', 'Outlier Data', 'AUV']",,"This paper describes localization of autonomous underwater vehicles(AUV), which can be used when some navigation sensor data are an outlier. In that situation, localization through existing navigation algorithms causes problems in long-range localization. Even if an outlier sensor data occurs once, problems of localization will continue. Also, if outlier sensor data is related to azimuth (direction of AUV), it causes bigger problems. Therefore, a parallel localization module, in which different algorithms are performed in a normal and abnormal situation should be designed. Before designing a parallel localization module, it is necessary to study an effective method in the abnormal situation. So, we propose a localization method through machine learning. For this method, a learning model consists of only Fully-Connected and trains through randomly contaminated real sea data. The ground truth of training is displacement between subsequent GPS data. As a result, average error in localization through the learning model is 0.4 times smaller than the average error in localization through the existing navigation algorithm. Through this result, we conclude that it is suitable for a component of the parallel localization module."

For all crimes, it is more critical to predict and prevent crimes in advance than to deal with them well after they occur. Therefore, in this paper, we predicted crime types and crime tools using the Multiclass Logistic Regression algorithm and Multiclass Neural Network algorithm of machine learning. Multiclass Logistic Regression algorithm showed higher accuracy, precision, and recall for analysis and prediction than Multiclass Neural Network algorithm. Through these analysis results, it is expected to contribute to a more pleasant and safe life by implementing a crime prediction system that predicts and prevents various crimes.

The time-consuming calculation portion of the matrix computation, however, basically includes the introduction of an inverse matrix. As the size of the matrix expands, the matrix solution method becomes a major challenge. In this paper, a new algorithm is introduced to enhance the speed of ridge regression estimator calculation through series expansion and computation recycle without adopting an inverse matrix in the calculation process or other factorization methods. In addition, the performances of the proposed algorithm and the existing algorithm were compared according to the matrix size.

Following a comprehensive literature review, there become clear several issues related to Arabic text summaries, keyword extraction, and sentiment analyses. These issues occur owing to several factors, such as the structure and morphology of Arabic text, a lack of machine-readable Arabic dictionaries, insufficient tools to manage Arabic text, no standard datasets, inherently cursive scripts, and isolated characters; thus, there is a need to create Arabic text in forms that can be easily read by machine learning, deep learning algorithms, and existing analysis tools. To achieve this, the Arabic texts must be converted into English texts. This paper proposes a lexicon called the AEC-Lexicon for use by all researchers working in Arabic, which is based on the Arabic case system and converts Arabic text into English text. Based on the experimental results of latent semantic indexing (LSI), it was found that texts generated from the proposed work exhibited a significant improvement over existing work (converted Arabic to English texts), considering reading and understanding as well as the relevance to the original Arabic text."

The classifier is composed of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network and a fully-connected neural network. As inputs to the LSTM network, pulse repetition interval and radio frequency are used among the pulse description words. The outputs of the classifier can be organized into three types of attributes, i.e., the change pattern of the pulse repetition interval and radio frequency, the number of steps in a period, and the number of pulses in a step. Two classifier structures, single-input and multiple- input, are proposed according to the number of input types.

The CT images were aligned to the corresponding MR images using a deformable registration, and the metallic dummy source markers were delineated using threshold-based segmentation followed by manual modification. The deformed CT (dCT), MR, and segmentation mask pairs were used for training and testing. The sCT generation model has a cascaded three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based architecture that converts MR images to CT images and segments the metallic marker. The performance of the model was evaluated with intensity-based comparison metrics.Results: The proposed model with segmentation loss outperformed the 3D U-Net in terms of errors between the sCT and dCT. The structural similarity score difference was not significant. Conclusions: Our study shows the two-task-based deep learning models for generating the sCT images using low-tesla MR images for 3D ICR. This approach will be useful to the MR-only workflow in high-dose-rate brachytherapy."

Who has given up on mathematics?

Although the term has not received precise defnition, it refers to students who have given up on learning mathematics. A precise defnition would require detailing the current supoza situation and identifying its characteristics. This study therefore conducted a statistical investigation of commonalities among students who have given up on learning mathematics; the study results revealed that these students can be characterized by their afective domain for mathematics learning. We found that a statistical model could determine the likelihood that a particular student would report having given up mathematics based on responses to questions related to the afective domain of mathematics learning. This aspect suggests the possibility of understanding supoza with the exclusive use of afective factors and emphasizes the signifcance of the afective domain of mathematics learning.

They strive to provide user with superior video quality in a limited bitrate environment. It is necessary to accurately determine the target bitrate range of the video under different quality requirements. Recently, several schemes have been proposed to meet this requirement. However, they do not take the impact of visual influence into account. In this paper, we propose a new multi-category model to accurately predict the target bitrate range with target visual quality by machine learning. Firstly, a dataset is constructed to generate multi-category models by machine learning. The quality score ladders and the corresponding bitrate-interval categories are defined in the dataset. Secondly, several types of spatial-temporal features related to VMAF evaluation metrics and visual factors are extracted and processed statistically for classification. Finally, bitrate prediction models trained on the dataset by RandomForest classifier can be used to accurately predict the target bitrate of the input videos with target video quality. The classification prediction accuracy of the model reaches 0.705 and the encoded video which is compressed by the bitrate predicted by the model can achieve the target perceptual quality."

Thus, immediate feedback and support to increase student motivation and engagement have become quite challenging. And this has inevitably witnessed the demise of motivation in learning. One of the difficulties the second language learners are facing are the lack of contact from the instructors. Under such circumstances, easily usable device that provides simple yet immediate feedback could be effective in increasing learner motivation. Machine translators are free and easily accessible to the learners so one of the device; Google Translator, was used in this research for learner correction. Findings show that the participants in the high group, especially those who made few grammatical errors, were not motivated to use the translated method. On the other hand, the low proficiency group felt motivated to use the translated method for future use under such circumstance. The finding is meaningful in that when face-to-face learning is minimized, translated writing method can increase not only the motivation of the learners but also exposure and practical learning time for the low proficiency group of learners."

As big data issue becomes an important area of supply chain and operations management, DEA is evolving into a data-oriented data science tool for benchmarking, performance evaluation, composite index construction and others. As the number of DMUs increases, the running-time to solve the standard DEA model sharply rises. Such situations are appearing more frequently in the era of big data. This issue could be an important challenge particularly when real-time data stream in at extremely high rates and the DEA analysis needs to be performed very quickly. Therefore, there exist practical needs for developing an efficient way of solving large-scale DEA problems. In this paper, we propose a practical approach for speeding up the DEA efficiency estimation process based on machine learning. In this approach, a sample of DMUs is selected from the population as a training data set, based on which a machine is trained to predict the efficiency scores of unselected or newly streamed-in DMUs. We also suggest a data augmentation technique to enhance the learning process under severe data class imbalance. The superior performance of the proposed approach over the conventional one in terms of efficiency prediction power as well as model computation time is shown through a series of computational experiments using randomly generated data."

Obesity and sarcopenia also have a synergy effect on the disease of the older adults. Objects: This study examined the risk factors for sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and sarcope-nia without obesity and developed prediction models. Methods: This machine-learning study used the 2008–2011 Korea National Health and Nu-trition Examination Surveys in the analysis. After data curation, 5,563 older participants were selected, of whom 1,169 had sarcopenia, 538 had sarcopenic obesity, and 631 had sarco-penia without obesity; the remaining 4,394 were normal. Decision tree and random forest models were used to identify risk factors. Results: The risk factors for sarcopenia chosen by both methods were body mass index (BMI) and duration of moderate physical activity; those for sarcopenic obesity were sex, BMI, and duration of moderate physical activity; and those for sarcopenia without obesity were BMI and sex. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of all prediction models exceeded 0.75. BMI could predict sarcopenia-related disease. Conclusion: Risk factors for sarcopenia-related diseases should be identified and programs for sarcopenia-related disease prevention should be developed.

Considering the issues of battery diagnosis, only normal battery data should be used to detect the faulty batteries, because it is practically impossible to obtain a faulty battery and its data. In this paper, we propose the first diagnosis approach using only the normal battery data based on machine learning. The approach is as follows. We define the normal battery data and the relationship between the features that constitute it, then we derive a model that can accurately predict the normal batteries. We determine the faults of the given unknown batteries by verifying how poorly the given discharging data fits the model. We evaluated the proposed methodology by conducting a case study using the NCR18650B batteries and constructing the normal battery model. We made a sample of the abnormal battery data from the overdischarge(OD) and overcharge(OC) batteries to verify if it can be diagnosed through the normal battery model. The experimental results showed that the accuracy to diagnose normal data as normal battery was approximately 96%, and the accuracy to diagnose abnormal data as faulty battery was approximately 97%."

Recently, commercial FO membrane modules have been developed so that full-scale FO process can be applied to seawater desalination or water reuse. In order to design a real-scale FO plant, the performance prediction of FO membrane modules installed in the plant is essential. Especially, the flux prediction is the most important task because the amount of diluted draw solution and concentrate solution flowing out of FO modules can be expected from the flux. Through a previous study, a theoretical based FO module model to predict flux was developed. However it needs an intensive numerical calculation work and a fitting process to reflect a complex module geometry. The idea of this work is to introduce deep learning to predict flux of FO membrane modules using 116 experimental data set, which include six input variables (flow rate, pressure, and ion concentration of DS and FS) and one output variable (flux). The procedure of optimizing a deep learning model to minimize prediction error and overfitting problem was developed and tested. The optimized deep learning model (error of 3.87%) was found to predict flux better than the theoretical based FO module model (error of 10.13%) in the data set which were not used in machine learning."

However, vectorization may ignore the structural information provided by image data. Convolutional neural network (CNN) using structural information has been introduced as a remedy to the drawback, but neural networks including CNN generally require a lot of data. On the other hand, SVM shows stable classification performances even with a small number of samples, and extensions of SVM reflecting structural information such as support matrix machine (SMM) and kernel support matrix machine (KSMM) have been recently proposed.

To reduce air pollution and the risk of fire, frequent dust removal is essential. However, conventional duct cleaning methods are time-and cost-extensive and cleaning results are not satisfactory. To resolve this issue, we previously suggested a quantitative dust determination algorithm using machine learning. However, as autonomous driving is equally essential, in this study, reinforcement learning is applied to autonomous driving of the cleaning robot, based on which a cleaning robot algorithm is developed. In a 3D virtual environment, reinforced (driving) training was conducted for various duct shapes. Through this process, collision with the duct wall can be avoided and the optimum route can be obtained. The dust amount is determined during drive by the duct cleaning robot which uses a previously developed dust quantification algorithm. The algorithm presented in this study is validated by installing it on the robot.

Sleep deprivation attack은 무선 센서의 sleep 상태 진입을 막음으로써 전력을 소진 시키는 치명적인 공격이지만 이에 대한 뚜렷한 대응책이 없다. 이에 본 논문에서는 클러스터링 기반 이진 탐색 트리 구조의 Sleep deprivation attack 탐지 모델을 제안한다. 본 논문에서 제안하는 sleep deprivation attack 탐지 모델은 기계학습을 통해 분류한 공격 센서 노드와 정상 센서 노드의 특징을 사용한다. 이때 탐지 모델에 사용한 특징은 Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), Decision Tree(DT), Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor(K-NN)을 이용하여 결정하였다. 결정된 특징은 본 논문에서 제안한 알고리즘에 사용하여 공격 탐지를 위한 값들을 계산하였으며, 계산한 값을 판정하기 위한 임계값은 SVM을 적용하여 도출하였다. 본 논문에서 제안하는 탐지 모델은 기계학습으로 도출된 특징과 임계값을 본 논문에서 제안한 탐지 알고리즘에 적용하여 구성하였으며, 실험을 통해 전체 센서 노드 20개 중 공격 센서 노드의 비율이 0.35일 때 94%의 탐지율을 갖고 평균 에너지 잔량은 기존 연구보다 최대 26% 향상된 결과를 보였다.","Wireless sensors that make up the Wireless Sensor Network generally have extremely limited power and resources. The wireless sensor enters the sleep state at a certain interval to conserve power. The Sleep deflation attack is a deadly attack that consumes power by preventing wireless sensors from entering the sleep state, but there is no clear countermeasure. Thus, in this paper, using clustering-based binary search tree structure, the Sleep deprivation attack detection model is proposed. The model proposed in this paper utilizes one of the characteristics of both attack sensor nodes and normal sensor nodes which were classified using machine learning. The characteristics used for detection were determined using Long Short-Term Memory, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor. Thresholds for judging attack sensor nodes were then learned by applying the SVM. The determined features were used in the proposed algorithm to calculate the values for attack detection, and the threshold for determining the calculated values was derived by applying SVM. Through experiments, the detection model proposed showed a detection rate of 94% when 35% of the total sensor nodes were attack sensor nodes and improvement of up to 26% in power retention."

Human being is the problem which penetrates two themes; The desire of human to be a machine and the point that machines aim for humanism. In terms of phenomena, human cyborgization and A.I robots to become human being seem to have different desires but it should be remembered that these two are actually aiming for same problem which is human. The common question is that it borrows and presents universal topics about the reality of what human beings are and the way of living. Artificial intelligence in the movie exists as a perfect machine, but from a human point of view, it becomes an incomplete existence. As a result, A.I is described as coveting its human creator to address their imperfections through perfect mechanical learning. Therefore, artificial intelligence in the movies learn intellect and sensibility through communication with humans. Eventually this makes machine to consider itself to be a human at some point blurring the boundaries between humans and artificial intelligence. This is repeated as the movie produces violent consequences by over-produced oppression through the subversion of the class. Thus this article defines the behavior of coveting human thinking at the point of artificial intelligence as a de-technical sign to delve deeply into the fact that human desire for the fundamental reason why artificial intelligence can be the cause."

Even it is difficult to apply the current Korean Civil Code provisions, such as ‘liability of possessor or owner of buildings or structures’ and ‘employer's vicarious liability’ provisions, ditectly to the civil cases for errors or omissions in the opinion of artificial intelligence. It is desirable to resolve those cases with strict liability or no-fault liability regime, based on objective indicators such as defects rather than negligence responsibility based on subjective indicators such as intention, fault, or negligence.Some further legislations would be required in the near future to resolve civil cases regarding the defects of artificial intelligence, but even prior to those efforts, a method of directly applying or analogizing the product liability law could be suggested provisionally instead. In judging defects in the opinion of artificial intelligence, it should be considered, most of all, whether the best practice recognized in the industry has been faithfully applied in each step in the main procedure of the machine-learning process used in artificial intelligence models. The bias issue of the data and informations used in the machine-learning process is most important consideration as well.In relation to packet based wiretapping in the national defense and security fields, artificial intelligence needs to be operated systematically with a focus on ‘traffic analysis,’ which is likely to minimize the possible infringement of human rights including privacy of the people.Regarding the responsibility and ethics of artificial intelligence, international organizations and non-profit organizations, as well as governments and corporations, have also been developing various ‘ethical principles’ to remove legal blanks and provide legal basis for the use of artificial intelligence.

These judicial prediction studies sought to select and coordinate various variables that affect the sentences, and to predict the outcome of the judgement through data pre-processing and machine learning algorithms. Chapter 3 of this paper tried to introduce quantitative research methods to the case study and also it is tried to investigate the administrative precedent research paper in 2020 and analyze methodologies. In addition, by using a software called Netminer it could be to extract items from the judgment prediction that is able to apply to the judgment evaluation system. As a future task, a dictionary of legal terms, ontologies, etc. needs to be developing to make a dataset. These attempts also mean introducing new methodologies that can interact with existing theoretical studies of precedents, but they are also valuable to prevent bias problems that may arise when the prediction only analyzes existing precedents."

Hence, a light detection and ranging semantic dataset suitable for semantic simultaneous localization and mapping and specialized for autonomous driving is proposed. This dataset is provided in a form that can be easily used by users familiar with existing two-dimensional image datasets, and it contains various weather and light conditions collected from a complex and diverse practical setting. An incremental and suggestive annotation routine is proposed to improve annotation efficiency. A model is trained to simultaneously predict segmentation labels and suggest class-representative frames.

A total of 27 crossbred sows (Yorkshire × Landrace; average body weight, 192.2 ± 4.8 kg) were assigned to three treatments in a randomized complete block design during the last stage of gestation (days 90 to 114). The sows in group 1 were fed a 3% fiber diet under neutral ambient temperature; the sows in group 2 were fed a diet with 3% fiber under high ambient temperature (HT); the sows in group 3 were fed a 6% fiber diet under HT. Eight popular deep learning-based feature extraction frameworks (DenseNet121, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MobileNet, VGG16, VGG19, and Xception) used for automatic swine posture classification were selected and compared using the swine posture image dataset that was constructed under real swine farm conditions. The neural network models showed excellent performance on previously unseen data (ability to generalize). The DenseNet121 feature extractor achieved the best performance with 99.83% accuracy, and both DenseNet201 and MobileNet showed an accuracy of 99.77% for the classification of the image dataset. The behavior of sows classified by the DenseNet121 feature extractor showed that the HT in our study reduced (p < 0.05) the standing behavior of sows and also has a tendency to increase (p = 0.082) lying behavior. High dietary fiber treatment tended to increase (p = 0.064) lying and decrease (p < 0.05) the standing behavior of sows, but there was no change in sitting under HT conditions."
Fault Diagnosis of Bearing Based on Convolutional Neural Network Using Multi-Domain Features,2021,"['CNN', 'DWT', 'Fault Diagnosis', 'Multi-domain', 'Time series Classification']",,"Failures frequently occurred in manufacturing machines due to complex and changeable manufacturing environments, increasing the downtime and maintenance costs. This manuscript develops a novel deep learning-based method named Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network (MDCNN) to deal with this challenging task with vibration signals. The proposed MDCNN consists of time-domain, frequency-domain, and statistical-domain feature channels. The Time-domain channel is to model the hidden patterns of signals in the time domain. The frequency-domain channel uses Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) to obtain the rich feature representations of signals in the frequency domain. The statistic-domain channel contains six statistical variables, which is to reflect the signals’ macro statistical-domain features, respectively. Firstly, in the proposed MDCNN, time-domain and frequency-domain channels are processed by CNN individually with various filters. Secondly, the CNN extracted features from time, and frequency domains are merged as time-frequency features. Lastly, time-frequency domain features are fused with six statistical variables as the comprehensive features for identifying the fault. Thereby, the proposed method could make full use of those three domain-features for fault diagnosis while keeping high distinguishability due to CNN's utilization. The authors designed massive experiments with 10-folder cross-validation technology to validate the proposed method's effectiveness on the CWRU bearing data set. The experimental results are calculated by ten-time averaged accuracy. They have confirmed that the proposed MDCNN could intelligently, accurately, and timely detect the fault under the complex manufacturing environments, whose accuracy is nearly 100%."

A Feature Inherited Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (FI-HCNN) for Motor Fault Severity Estimation Using Stator Current Signals,2021,['Severity estimation · Fault diagnosis · Motor current signature analysis · Hierarchical network · Induction motor · Convolutional neural network'],,"Motors, which are one of the most widely used machines in the manufacturing field, take charge of a key role in precision machining. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the health state of the motor that affects the quality of the product. The research outlined in this paper aims to improve motor fault severity estimation by suggesting a novel deep learning method, specifically, feature inherited hierarchical convolutional neural network (FI-HCNN). FI-HCNN consists of a fault diagnosis part and a severity estimation part, arranged hierarchically. The main novelty of the proposed FI-HCNN is the special inherited structure between the hierarchy; the severity estimation part utilizes the latent features to exploit the fault-related representations in the fault diagnosis task. FI-HCNN can improve the accuracy of the fault severity estimation because the level-specific abstraction is supported by the latent features. Also, FI-HCNN has ease in practical application because it is developed based on stator current signals which are usually acquired for a control purpose. Experimental studies of mechanical motor faults, including eccentricity, broken rotor bars, and unbalanced conditions, are used to corroborate the high performance of FI-HCNN, as compared to both conventional methods and other hierarchical deep learning methods."
"AI시대, 인간의 정체성과 존엄성 교육의 방향",2021,['AI'],,"The issue of AI's ethical consciousness has been constantly on the rise. AI learns and imitates everything behavior human beings do, just like a child. Therefore, the ethical consciousness we currently demand from AI is first the ethical consciousness required of humans, and at the center of it is the dignity of humans. Thus, this study analyzed human identity and its problems according to the development of AI technology, apologized the theological premises and characteristics of human dignity, and sought the direction of human dignity education as follows. First, this study discussed the development of AI and its relation to human beings. The development of AI's technology has led to the sharing of ""reason or intelligence"" with machines called AI which have been restricted to the exclusive property of mankind. This raised the question of the superior humanity which humans would be remained to be distinguished from AI machines. Second, this study discussed transhumanism and human identity. Transhumanism has been argued for the combination of AI machines and humans in order to improve inefficient human intelligence and human capabilities. However, the combination of AI machines with humans raised the issue of human identity. In the AI era, human identity is to believe thoughts that God had when he built us. Third, this study apologized theological premise and characteristic about human dignity. Human dignity has become a key concept of the constitution and international human rights treaties around the world. Nonetheless, declarative conviction that human is dignified is difficult to be understanded without Christian theological premise. Theological premise of human dignity lies on the fact that human is dignified feature being granted life by Heavenly Father. This feature lies on longing for ""Goodness"" and ""eternality"", pursuit of beauty, a happy being in relationship with others. Fourth, this study presented the direction of human dignity education. The direction of human dignity education has to awaken what is identity of human and how human beings were created and how much they are precious. Furthermore, it lead human to ponder consciously and accept the highest value of what human beings are, how they were created, and how precious they are. That is about educating human identity, and its core is that regardless of the circumstances - the wealth gap, knowledge level, skin color, gender, age, disability, etc. - all people are in God's image and for the glory of God, thereby being very important to God."
A Method for Accelerating the Inference Process of FPGA-based LSTM for Biometric Systems,2021,"['SoC design and applications', 'Neural chips', 'High-level synthesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Radar and sonar signal processing']",,"Biometric systems require the regression and classification of biological sensing data, which are both carried out using machine learning. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is one of the most common methods used for regression and classification. We have developed and implemented a low-energy LSTM algorithm for the regression of microwave sensor signals in a small-scale FPGA. Experimental results show that the FPGA-based parallel-pipelined unrolled algorithm can reduce the computation time by 95% compared to an FPGA-based sequential algorithm. In addition, we found that the power consumption can be reduced by 92% and 91% compared to that obtained with a high-end GPU and CPU, respectively."

Currently creative methodologies for this paradigm are continuously being unfolded in innovative ways. Also, as the proportion of service industry increases, especially in developed countries, a merging of manufacturing industry and service industry is taking place. Design reflects this change and emphasizes consumer experiences. Therefore, companies are trying to reflect psychological characteristics of consumers in the design of their products and services. This paper studies the psychological characteristics of design users. It attempts to analyze psychological theories from the perspective of designology and presents systematic psychological information that can be applied to contemporary design. This paper limits the scope of research to user's behavioral system among psychological theories related to design. (Method) This research has been conducted through literature review and case analyses. Literature review regarding psychology, designology, and design psychology has been conducted. For design case analyses, data have been collected through literature review, article review, field trips, and internet search. (Results) Psychological principles related to behavioral system of design users have been analyzed in terms of inducing behaviors, learning and reinforcing behaviors, and human errors. In relation to inducing behaviors, concepts of Affordance and Nudge were presented, and in relation to learning and reinforcing behaviors, the theory of Operant Conditioning was presented. In relation to human errors that inevitably occur because humans are imperfect, the concepts of planning error and execution error were presented, and the cognitive load, which is an important reason for these human errors, was investigated. Next, the design methodologies and actual design cases were analyzed in relation to psychological theories that are proposed. Inducing behaviors through design includes unconstrained methods(Visibility, Mapping, Gamification, Application of Familiar Everyday Experiences, Satisfaction of Unconscious Needs) and methods of constraint(Psychological Constraint, Physical Constraint, Sequential Constraint). Regarding learning and reinforcing behavior through design, design methodology of Operant Conditioning was analyzed. Lastly, as strategies for supporting human errors through design, Prevention Strategy, Recovery Strategy, Post-Damage Minimization Strategy, and Confirmation and Warning Strategy were presented. (Conclusions) As can be seen from the above results, designers can induce and reinforce desirable behaviors of users through design elements. In addition, when we see the results regarding the support of human errors through design, we can realize how much influence designers can have on human life. These findings endow designers with great power. However, designers must keep in mind that social and moral responsibility also comes with this power. Designers need to be aware of these effects of design on human behaviors, and need to use them responsibly and effectively."
Modification of a Density-Based Spatial Clustering Algorithm for Applications with Noise for Data Reduction in Intrusion Detection Systems,2021,"['Clustering', 'CART', 'Intrusion detection system', 'DBSCAN', 'Data reduction']",,"Monitoring activity in computer networks is required to detect anomalous activities. This monitoring model is known as an intrusion detection system (IDS). Most IDS model developments are based on machine learning. The development of this model requires activity data in the network, either normal or anomalous, in sufficient amounts. The amount of available data also has an impact on the slow learning process in the IDS system, with the resulting performance sometimes not being proportional to the amount of data. This study proposes an IDS model that combines DBSCAN modification with the CART algorithm. DBSCAN modification is performed to reduce data by adding a MinNeighborhood parameter, which is used to determine the distance of the density to the cluster center point, which will then be marked for deletion. The test results, using the Kaggle and KDDCup99 datasets, show that the proposed system model is able to maintain a classification accuracy above 90% for 80% data reduction. This performance was also followed by a decrease in computation time, for the Kaggle dataset from 91.8 ms to 31.1 ms, while for the KDDCup99 dataset from 5.535 seconds to 1.120 seconds."

Road Type Identification Ahead of the Tire Using D-CNN and Reflected Ultrasonic Signals,2021,"['Ultrasonic sensor', 'Road type identification', 'Friction coefficient', 'Short-time Fourier transform', 'Machinelearning', 'Deep convolutional neural network']",,"Every land moving object accelerates or decelerates based on the frictional coefficient of the road surface. It has been known that this coefficient on the road is determined by the type of road surface. In this work, we propose a simplistic, machine-learning based solution to estimate the road type using the reflected ultrasonic signals paired with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver. Since the reflected signal contains the material information of the surface due to the difference in the surface roughness and acoustic impedance, different characteristics can be observed for each frequency of the reflected signal. To exploit such characteristics, the signals are transformed into the frequency domain using short-time Fourier transform. In addition, a deep convolutional neural network is applied as the road identifier due to its well-known representational power. In order to verify the aforementioned ideas, the ample database consisting of eight types of road surfaces are obtained with the ultrasonic sensors. And then, the database is used to train the model, as well as to evaluate the accuracy of the trained model. It can be seen that the proposed method makes it easier and more accurate to identify the type of road surface than the conventional methods."

The membership function in the premise part of the fuzzy rule is formed by using the center points of the cluster obtained through fuzzy clustering. The consequent part of the fuzzy rule is made of a linear function whose coefficients are trained by LSE-based learning. The Sequential aggregation model can be divided into a basic model and a compensation model. A basic model means the first model of the sequential aggregation model, whereas a compensation model is the role of minimizing the error between the output of the basic model and the target output. The basic model and the compensation model are selected by comparing the coefficient of determination of the model. Through experiments carried out with the aid of the high-dimensional synthetic datasets and machine learning datasets, we show the superiority of the proposed design methodology by comparing the proposed sequential aggregation model with the existing fuzzy models."

Intelligent information technology shows various forms and aspects depending on the application field and purpose, and the nature and level of the risks that follow are not constant. In machine learning-based AI systems that utilize huge amounts of personal data, threats of privacy infringement of data subjects exist, and bias or opacity of data and algorithms implies a further possibility of infringement of rights and interests. When an automation system using intelligent information technology replaces and supplements human decision-making and behavior, it also creates a third risk area where it is difficult to apply the existing principle of risk responsibility or a significant causal relationship between behavior and outcome. In recent years, academic discussions have been actively conducted on the risks of intelligent information technology, especially AI, and the number of studies and legislative cases that create 'AI norms' increased rapidly.In the Korean National Assembly, several bills have been proposed to promote intelligent informatization policies and establish, and the Framework Act on Intelligent Information was passed and has been in effect since December 2020. This law also includes means of regulatory administration to cope with the risk of intelligent informatization, such as social impact assessment and safety protection measures, but specific enforcement ordinances and administrative legislation for law enforcement are still insufficient. In addition, this law systematizes the national legal policy policy and does not directly stipulate legal rules for discriminatory treatment, unfair practices, and procedural violations of new aspects caused by AI systems. Therefore, the current law alone cannot sufficiently cope with the potential risks of intelligent information technology and internal risks of the system, and individual and subsequent legislation are required.Regulatory administration in the field of intelligent information technology should focus above all on optimizing the distribution of functions of private and public control. In other words, in order to control the risk of intelligent information technology and increase its social acceptance, it is necessary to establish a regulatory legal order that focuses on risk management, control of illegal acts, and attribution of post-responsibility. The goal of transforming the legal system will be gradually realized by preparing organizations and procedures to realize co-regulation and specifying related systems such as mandatory conformity assessment, certification, and impact assessment."

It differs from previous studies in that it typified households by income level, utilized a variety of variables that were not used before to improve performance of the model, and conducted decision tree analysis, a representative method of machine learning.According to the results, as income increased, the ratio of delinquency experiences and subjective debt burdens decreased, while financial fitness became better, which raises the need to pay attention to the vulnerability of low-income households. In addition, according to the decision tree analysis, the most important variable that increases the possibility of debt delinquency, regardless of income class, was subjective debt burden. Other variables showed different importance depending on the income level. Redeemability, DTA(Debt to Asset Ratio) and residence types were important variables in low- and middle-income models, while credit card-related loans, redeemability, and consumption-purpose loans found to be important in high-income model.This study draws suggestions by income class as follows: First of all, low-income households, particularly vulnerable to external shocks such as benchmark interest rate hikes, should ease their debt burden through Debt Management, and credit counseling should be combined to help them completely escape from debt. For mid-income households, strengthening financial fitness centered on asset formation should be supported. Finally, in the case of high-income households, monitoring is necessary for some groups that are likely to be overdue, considering householders’ age, occupation, and whether they have a credit card loans."

Various fault detection and diagnosis methods have been developed to improve these technologies. For example, the “Voltage and Current Measurement Method” based on the One-Diode model has been widely adopted in many case studies to predict a maximum power point (i.e., power, current, and voltage) and then detect any issues that occur under harsh outdoor conditions. Although the One-Diode model has demonstrated accurate performance for fault detection and diagnosis, the accuracy has typically been limited to crystalline PV modules. To overcome this limitation, many fault diagnosis methods have been proposed, and machine-learning fault detection and diagnosis methods are effective alternatives because of the nonlinear output features and varying operating conditions of PV arrays. Therefore, this study presents the prediction model of maximum power point (MPP) using artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. The prediction model of MPP was generated through an optimization analysis. The MPP was validated by using measured data obtained from a building attached to a PV (BAPV) system in Korea. The results of the optimization study showed the highest predictive accuracy when the structure of the ANN model was trained and learned with one hidden layer, 20 neurons per hidden layer, a sigmoid function, and an 0.01 learning rate. The coefficient of variation of RMS error (CvRMSE) between the predicted value and the labelled value was 3.14%. The prediction model for MPP was verified by using the measured data.

For humans, work is an important act beyond production activities for survival. Humanity forms social culture through work and finds the purpose of life. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, represented by artificial intelligence, is expected to eliminate about 5 million jobs in the labor market. Future labor has no longer been able to exist as a ‘job’ as a means of maintaining a living. As a result, the era of making a living in return for labor will soon disappear. Digital or AI are tools made for humans, but humans now have to compete with their machines. Jobs that have once disappeared are not easy to recover again, and the speed of digital experiences has become difficult to reverse. However, digital technology also enabled rapid response to infectious diseases, and provided work efficiency and various empirical opportunities by providing a virtual environment at a time when non-face-to-face is becoming important. On the other hand, it is also true that this environment is divided into “accessible” and “inaccessible,” giving rise to another possibility of inequality.The fact that retro culture, which finds slow and uncomfortable things in this situation, is becoming a brand has implications. Retro culture witnessed on LP boards, paper, prints, kidults, travel, festivals, and slow food is a series of movements expressing one’s identity in a world that is uniformized with mass production and popular culture, like a kind of struggle to pursue stability and maintain balance. In front of science and technology that even adds virtual reality, retro and analog cultural phenomena, which are empirical products, throw a new point in the birth of tools with superintelligence.With the virtual environment reaching the formation of learning, work, and social relations, more effective digital and analog convergence becomes natural when this ambivalent aspect is taken into account. The priority for this is empathy storytelling. Empathy is also an important part of social order and corporate interests. In addition, the cultivation of a sense of community that brings people together in an emergency situation acts as an important factor in the logic of empathy and balance. Securing online and offline experiences and areas of activity that narrow the gap between generations based on local communities, and sustainable social responsibility and solidarity of companies are alternatives leading to empathy brand marketing. This will not lead to “extinction” of jobs, but to “change.” Concerns and discussions on balance and empathy have been talked about in the sense of harmony and coexistence with countless crises for mankind, but they will be able to reach a new height in front of the pandemic and the Fourth Industrial Revolution."
Detection of Atrial Fibrillation in Short-Lead Electrocardiogram Recordings Obtained using a Smart Scale,2021,,,"Atrial fi brillation (AF) is the type of arrhythmia that raises possibility of severe health problems such as heart failure and stroke and it is known that a major risk factor of AF includes overweight and obesity. Based on this association between such health-related indicators, we propose a smart scale that is capable of measuring weight and electrocardiography (ECG) simultaneously. The scale was developed using Arduino Uno, a Wheatstone bridge load cell, and ECG sensors. The ECG signals were processed to compute heart rate (in other words, RR interval). The smart scale was evaluated with four healthy volunteers in terms of reliability showing high agreement with a commercial device for ECG monitoring. In addition, it implements Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection using machine-learning classifi ers including a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method, a Decision Tree (DT), and a Neural Network (NN) on relatively short recordings of ECG obtained while using the scale. The root mean square of the successive diff erences between heart beats (RMSSD) and the Shannon entropy of the RR interval (ECG features) were extracted from ECG signals for AF detection. Performance of AF detection was tested with patients who were treated at a Cardiology Center after balancing data by applying over- and under-sampling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and the Tomek Link (T-Link) algorithm. After addressing the data imbalance, the AF detection performance of each classifi er (kNN, DT, and NNs) was 98.9%, 97.8%, and 98.9% respectively. This work has successfully demonstrated weight and cardio activity monitoring features while using a scale that may help keep the records of sensitive health related indexes on a daily basis."

These data are being analyzed through classifiers based on machine learning. The main problem at this time is data imbalance. When we train imbalanced data, it may happen that classification accuracy is degraded due to over-fitting with majority class data. To overcome the problem of data imbalance, oversampling strategy that increases the quantity of data of minority class data is widely used. It requires to tuning process about suitable method and parameters for data distribution. To improve the process, In this study, we propose a strategy to explore and optimize oversampling combinations and ratio based on various methods such as synthetic minority oversampling technique and generative adversarial networks through genetic algorithms. After sampling credit card fraud detection which is a representative case of data imbalance, with the proposed strategy and single oversampling strategies, we compare the performance of trained classifiers with each data.

Generative design and fabrication of a locust-inspired gliding wing prototype for micro aerial robots,2021,"['computer-associated design', 'bioinspired corrugated wings', 'vacuum thermoforming', 'additive manufacturing', 'flexural stiffness', 'maximum deformation rate']",,"Gliding is generally one of the most efficient modes of flight in natural fliers that can be further emphasized in the aircraft industry to reduce emissions and facilitate endured flights. Natural wings being fundamentally responsible for this phenomenon are developed over millions of years of evolution. Artificial wings, on the other hand, are limited to the human-proposed conceptual design phase often leading to sub-optimal results. However, the novel Generative Design (GD) method claims to produce mechanically improved solutions based on robust and rigorous models of design conditions and performance criteria. This study investigates the potential applications of this Computer-Associated Design (CAsD) technology to generate novel micro aerial vehicle wing concepts that are structurally more stable and efficient. Multiple performance-driven solutions (wings) with high-level goals are generated by an infinite scale cloud computing solution executing a machine learning-based GD algorithm. Ultimately, the highest performing CAsD concepts are numerically analysed, fabricated, and mechanically tested according to our previous study, and the results are compared to the literature for qualitative as well as quantitative analysis and validations. It was concluded that the GD-based tandem wings’ (forewing and hindwing) ability to withstand fracture failure without compromising structural rigidity was optimized by 78% compared to its peer models. However, the weight was slightly increased by 11% with 14% drop in stiffness when compared to our models from previous study."

Estimating United States-Asia Clothing Trade: Multiple Regression vs. Artificial Neural Networks,2021,"['Artificial Neural Networks', 'China', 'Clothing Trade', 'Economic', 'Gravity Trade Model']",,"This study discusses the influence of economic factors on the clothing exports from China and 15 South and Southeast Asian countries to the United States. A basic gravity trade model with three predictors, including the GDP value produced by exporting and importing countries and their geographical distance was established to explain the bilateral trade patterns. The conventional approach of multiple regression and the novel approach of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were developed based on the value of clothing exports from 2012 to 2018 and applied to the trade pattern prediction of 2019. The results showed that ANNs can achieve a more accurate prediction in bilateral trade patterns than the commonly-used econometric analysis of the basic gravity trade model. Future studies can examine the predictive power of ANNs on an extended gravity model of trade that includes explanatory variables in social and environmental areas, such as policy, initiative, agreement, and infrastructure for trade facilitation, which are crucial for policymaking and managerial consideration. More research should be conducted for the examination of the balance between developing countries’ economic growth and their social and environmental sustainability and for the application of more advanced machine-learning algorithms of global trade flow examination."

Therefore, this study checked priority conservation areas to select candidate PAs when considering the impact of land development. We determined the conservation priorities by analyzing four scenarios based on existing conservation areas and reflecting the development impact using MARXAN, the decision-making support software for the conservation plan. The development impact was derived using the developed area ratio, population density, road network system, and traffic volume. The conservation areas of endangered species were derived using the data of the appearance points of birds, mammals, and herptiles from the 3rd National Ecosystem Survey. These two factors were used as input data to map conservation priority areas with the machine learning-based optimization methodology. The result identified many non-PAs areas that were expected to play an important role conserving endangered species.When considering the land development impact, it was found that the areas with priority for conservation were fragmented. Even when both the development impact and existing PAs were considered, the priority was higher in areas from the current PAs because many road developments had already been completed around the current PAs. Therefore, it is necessary to consider areas other than the current PAs to protect endangered species and seek alternative measures to fragmented conservation priority areas."

(2) 관측된 CO<sub>2</sub> 수지의 경년 변동이 문헌에 보고된 조절 인자들과의 선형적인 인과관계로 설명이 가능한가? 이에 답하기 위해, 본 연구는 KoFlux GDK 관측지에서 에디 공분산 기술로 2006년부터 2020년까지 15년 동안 관측된 CO<sub>2</sub> 플럭스 자료와 생기상학적 자료를 분석하였다. 연구 결과, (1) GDK는 15년 자료를 평균해서 보면 약한 CO<sub>2</sub> 발원이며, 관측기간 동안 흡원과 발원 사이를 오갔으나 최근 5년 동안 CO<sub>2</sub> 발원으로서의 강도가 증가하고 있다. (2) 전천일사, 생장기간, 엽면적지수의 경년 변동은 총일차생산량(Gross Primary Production, GPP)의 경년 변동과 양의 상관관계(R<sup>2</sup>=0.32~0.45)가 있는 반면, 기온과 지표면 온도의 경년 변동은 생태계 호흡(Ecosystem Respiration, RE)의 경년 변동과 유의한 상관관계가 없었다. 또한, 관측기간 초반(첫 10년)의 CO<sub>2</sub> 플럭스와 기상요인 및 생물학적 요인으로 학습시킨 기계학습은 관측기간 후반(최근 5년)의 GPP와 RE의 경년 변동을 제대로 모사해내지 못했다. 단, 고사목에서 배출된 탄소 추정량이 CO<sub>2</sub> 발원으로의 전환에 일부 기여했을 것으로 추정된다.

Net ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> exchange of old-growth forests is theoretically near zero; however, it can be a CO<sub>2</sub> sink or source depending on the intervention of disturbance or management. In this study, we report the CO<sub>2</sub> budget dynamics of the Gwangneung deciduous old-growth forest (GDK) in Korea and examined the following two questions: (1) is the preserved GDK indeed CO<sub>2</sub> neutral as theoretically known? and (2) can we explain the dynamics of CO<sub>2</sub> budget by the common mechanisms reported in the literature? To answer, we analyzed the 15-year long CO<sub>2</sub> flux data measured by eddy covariance technique along with other biometeorological data at the KoFlux GDK site from 2006 to 2020. The results showed that (1) GDK switched back-and-forth between sink and source of CO<sub>2</sub> but averaged to be a week CO<sub>2</sub> source (and turning to a moderate CO<sub>2</sub> source for the recent five years) and (2) the interannual variability of solar radiation, growing season length, and leaf area index showed a positive correlation with that of gross primary production (GPP) ( R<sup>2</sup>=0.32~0.45); whereas the interannual variability of both air and surface temperature was not significantly correlated with that of ecosystem respiration (RE). Furthermore, the machine learning-based model trained using the dataset of early monitoring period (first 10 years) failed to reproduce the observed interannual variations of GPP and RE for the recent five years. Biomass data analysis suggests that carbon emissions from coarse woody debris may have contributed partly to the conversion to a moderate CO<sub>2</sub> source. To properly understand and interpret the long-term CO<sub>2</sub> budget dynamics of GDK, new framework of analysis and modeling based on complex systems science is needed. Also, it is important to maintain the flux monitoring and data quality along with the monitoring of coarse woody debris and disturbances."

The uncertainties in GPP-VI relationship increase with temporal resolution. Uncertainty also exists in the eddy covariance (EC)-based estimation of GPP, arising from the partitioning of the measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) into GPP and ecosystem respiration (RE). For two forests and two agricultural sites, we correlated the EC-derived GPP in various time scales with three different near-surface remotely sensed Vis: (1) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), (2) enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and (3) near infrared reflectance from vegetation (NIRv) along with NIRvP (i.e., NIRv multiplied by photosynthetically active radiation, PAR). Among the compared VIs, NIRvP showed highest correlation with half-hourly and monthly GPP at all sites. The NIRvP was used to test the reliability of GPP derived by two different NEE partitioning methods: (1) original KoFlux methods (GPP<sub>Ori</sub>) and (2) machine-learning based method (GPP<sub>ANN</sub>). GPP<sub>ANN</sub> showed higher correlation with NIRvP at half-hourly time scale, but there was no difference at daily time scale. The NIRvP-GPP correlation was lower under clear sky conditions due to co-limitation of GPP by other environmental conditions such as air temperature, vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture. However, under cloudy conditions when photosynthesis is mainly limited by radiation, the use of NIRvP was more promising to test the credibility of NEE partitioning methods. Despite the necessity of further analyses, the results suggest that NIRvP can be used as the proxy of GPP at high temporal-scale. However, for the VIs-based GPP estimation with high temporal resolution to be meaningful, complex systems-based analysis methods (related to systems thinking and self-organization that goes beyond the empirical VIs-GPP relationship) should be developed."
한문고전과 인성교육 [1] - ‘대학생’과 ‘일반인’ 대상의 인성교육을 중심으로 -,2021,"['인성', '인성교육진흥법', '한문고전', '교수·학습방법', '논어', 'Personality education', '人性敎育', 'Chinese classics', '漢文古典', 'Older generations', '旣成世代', 'Effectiveness of personality education', '人性敎育 實效性', 'the Analects', '論語']",,"Will this article be successful using the Chinese classics for personality education(人性敎育)? This paper starts with these cliché and classic propositions. However, the subject of personality education at this time will be limited to university students and the general public for discussion. The reason why I made the functional relationship between Chinese classics and personality education as the topic was that I had a history of my country’s unfortunate past. As we experienced the Japanese colonial period, we forgot what our right traditional values were. As if our traditional values were not correct, we recognized that we received a colony from Japan. However, since the foundation of the traditional culture consists of Chinese characters, most of the people in our country get allergic reactions just by saying that it is Chinese classics. After the Liberation, we were once again ruled by the West. At this time, our traditional culture was dismissed as a corpse in an old museum after the so-called ‘modernization(近·現代化).’But, looking back at our appearance in the 21st century, we longed for reflection on our ‘traditional values’. In particular, reflection on ‘personality’, or ‘humanism’, has merged as a challenge since entering the artificial intelligence era of technological civilization. Based on this sense of problem, I examined the possibility and effectiveness of Hanmun High School, which was guaranteed by our traditional values in the past, by incorporating it into the actual site of personality education.First, the government should diagnose the virtues of ‘personality’ and establish the meaning of the ‘personality education promotion law.’Second, it was argued that true personality education should start with older generations, despite acknowledging that the lower the age, the higher the effectiveness of personality education. In this process, we applied the Jewish style of ‘Havuruta education’ and the dynamics between our classical educations.Third, in order to fully implement personality education through the Chinese classics, it was ironically believed that the positive correlation between ‘Chinese classics and personality education’ could be secured only by criticizing negative images hidden in Chinese characters and Chinese characters. Fourth, by presenting teaching and learning methods that incorporate literary classics (especially the Analects(論語), Myeangsim Bogam(明心寶鑑), etc.) into personality education for university students and the general public, and calculating their educational effects by statistics, we derived how effective Chinese classics can be in personality education. Most of all, personality education(人性敎育) focused on the fact that character education should not be implemented during childhood and adolescence, and that it is not an issue that should be passed on only to older generations. Personality education must be such an area that one must contemplate together from cradle to grave. We are living in the age of artificial intelligence, where we may be involved in machines."

As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, the function of corporate law or the board of directors as a mechanism to solve the agency problems in team production will be reduced. Instead, it is expected that a problem of data governance will attract attention. Against this backdrop, this article examines current debates on legal issues associated with assisted AI and autonomous AI, separately.  Assisted AI is not a big deal from the corporate law perspective. Sophisticated technologies are already widely used in business, and such tendency could not change the role and liability of corporate directors. The bottom line is that the duty of care of directors or the business judgment rule is so flexible, and thus directors are very unlikely to be subject to liability regime associate with being assisted by artificial intelligence. With the advent of artificial intelligence, however, the establishment of proper system of data governance should be alternatively emphasized, since effective use of artificial intelligence largely depends on the appropriateness of the data used for machine learning. Such of establishing and maintaining data governance primarily lies with the CEO, and oversight duty of the board of directors will apply.   Autonomous AI raises several legal issues. First of all, it creates a new problem; the cause and proper solution of the problem will be changed. Traditionally, for instance, corporate law is mainly concerned with managerial incentives of pursuing private benefits, but the problem with artificial intelligence is not incentives but errors or failures in algorithms. In addition, the ex post liability regime is no longer properly applied, and ex ante regulation or control will be more emphasized. Since conventional liability of directors does not seem to fit here, there is little need for appointing artificial intelligence as a director or recognizing personality of artificial intelligence. At current stage, however, it is necessary to clearly assign the corporate purpose, which attracts huge attention recently in Europe."

Breast cancer survival rates have been increased with the use of new advanced treatments, largely due to the factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease. Many machine learning classification models have been adopted and modified to diagnose the breast cancer disease. In order to enhance the performance of classification model, our research proposes a model using A Hybrid Modified K-Means Clustering with Modified SVM (Support Vector Machine) Machine learning algorithm to create a new method which can highly improve the performance and prediction. The proposed Machine Learning model is to improve the performance of machine learning classifier. The Proposed Model rectifies the irregularity in the dataset and they can create a new high quality dataset with high accuracy performance and prediction. The recognized datasets Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) Dataset have been used to perform our research. Using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) Dataset, We have created our Model that can help to diagnose the patients and predict the probability of the breast cancer.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme that can be applied to machine learning distributed environment. The proposed scheme composes distributed servers in a level hash table structure and assigns machine learning task to the server in consideration of the performance of each server. We implemented distributed servers and experimented, and compared the performance with the existing hashing scheme. Compared with the existing hashing scheme, the proposed scheme showed an average 26% speed improvement, and more than 38% reduced the number of waiting tasks to assign to the server."

Approaches to Forming ETHICAL AI as an Artificial Moral Agent: Suggesting Virtue Education Method Through Comparison of Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches,2021,"['Artificial Moral Agents(AMA)', 'AI', 'Ethics', 'Deep Learning', 'Teaching and Learning Method']",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to propose that the virtue education method can be utilized in the process of learning to have ethics as an Artificial Moral Agent(AMA). Recent various discussions about AI presuppose the coexistence of humans and AI. Meanwhile, in order for coexistence to be achieved, it is fundamentally necessary for humans as individual beings to form relationships with others in an appropriate way. This study focused on the use of the virtue education method among the methods for AI to learn the order of relationships as an AMA that becomes the counterpart of human ethical behavior in the interaction between humans and AI. Method: This study presented basic data using the method of literature research. And based on this, a virtue education method that can be applied to AMA was developed and presented using the method of development research. With this, This research tried to argue about the necessity and validity of the virtue education method. Results: This study examines that the current discussion on ethical learning in AMA is mainly based on a Top-down approach based on traditional ethical theory. And as an alternative to this, it is suggested that machine learning and deep learning methods can be used as a method for AMA to learn ethics. Based on this, the characteristics and validity of virtue ethics applicable to AMA were presented. And as a method to learn it, a teaching and learning method applicable to the learning of AMA was proposed. Conclusion: Currently, the approach to preparing ethics for AMA tends to mainly choose a Top-down approach in which a specific ethical theory is selected and the design of a computational algorithm and system that can implement the theory is derived. However, just as children develop moral reasoning through appropriate developmental stages, AMA also needs to actively introduce a bottom-up approach to forming ethical judgment principles. As a specific method, we propose to use the method of grafting the virtue education method of analyzing the characteristics of a virtuous person and repeating it by imitating it to the deep learning method of AI."

In addition, small-scale PV plants rarely receive maintenance after installation. Managers thus need a monitoring system that predicts the power of the PV plant in order to maintain performance and facilitate O&M. Recently, methods using big data to predict PV plant power have been applied. In this paper, power was predicted through learning based on PV plant field data. Furthermore, the error of the estimated power was analyzed through accuracy evaluations, RMSE, and R2 analysis. As the learning method, linear regression analysis was applied among machine learning models. Existing linear regression models can immediately estimate power by learning irradiation data as input variables and power data as output variables. However, if the PV system malfunctions, the accuracy of the estimated power generation decreases. In this paper, in order to address this problem, power was estimated by learning irradiation data as input variables and voltage and current data as output variables rather than directly estimating the power. As a result, the RMSE of the proposed linear regression equation was 15.9235kw, yielding a better power estimate than the existing method (16.4241kw)."

Bottleneck 층은 convolution 층을 통해 추출된 특징 이미지상의 특징들 중에서 최적의 특징들만 선별하여 convolution 1x1 ReLU로 채널을 감소시키고convolution 3x3 ReLU를 실시한다.

Softmax 층은 입력층 노드의 값과 연산을 진행하려는 목표 노드 사이의 가중치와 곱을 하여 합하고 활성화 함수를 통해 0～1 사이의 값으로 변환한다. 학습이 완료된 후에 인식 과정에서는 학습 과정과 마찬가지로 카메라를 이용한 이미지 획득, 측정 위치 검출, 딥러닝을 활용한 비원형 유리병 분류 등을 수행하여 비원형 유리병을 분류한다. 제안된 다각형 용기의 품질 향상을 위한 딥러닝 구조의 성능을 평가하기 위하여 공인시험기관에서 실험한 결과, 양품/불량 판별 정확도 99%로 세계최고 수준과 동일한 수준으로 산출되었다. 검사 소요 시간은 평균 1.7초로 비원형 머신비전 시스템을 사용하는 생산 공정의 가동 시간 기준 내로 산출되었다. 따라서 본 본문에서 제안한 다각형 용기의 품질 향상을 위한 딥러닝 구조의 성능의 그 효용성이 입증되었다.","In this paper, we propose the development of deep learning structure to improve quality of polygonal containers. The deep learning structure consists of a convolution layer, a bottleneck layer, a fully connect layer, and a softmax layer. The convolution layer is a layer that obtains a feature image by performing a convolution 3x3 operation on the input image or the feature image of the previous layer with several feature filters. The bottleneck layer selects only the optimal features among the features on the feature image extracted through the convolution layer, reduces the channel to a convolution 1x1 ReLU, and performs a convolution 3x3 ReLU. The global average pooling operation performed after going through the bottleneck layer reduces the size of the feature image by selecting only the optimal features among the features of the feature image extracted through the convolution layer. The fully connect layer outputs the output data through 6 fully connect layers. The softmax layer multiplies and multiplies the value between the value of the input layer node and the target node to be calculated, and converts it into a value between 0 and 1 through an activation function. After the learning is completed, the recognition process classifies non-circular glass bottles by performing image acquisition using a camera, measuring position detection, and non-circular glass bottle classification using deep learning as in the learning process. In order to evaluate the performance of the deep learning structure to improve quality of polygonal containers, as a result of an experiment at an authorized testing institute, it was calculated to be at the same level as the world’s highest level with 99% good/defective discrimination accuracy. Inspection time averaged 1.7 seconds, which was calculated within the operating time standards of production processes using non-circular machine vision systems. Therefore, the effectiveness of the performance of the deep learning structure to improve quality of polygonal containers proposed in this paper was proven."

Randomness of stock prices can be resolved to some extent with deep learning algorithms, but external impacts such as the macro-environment surrounding stock prices and rapid changes in the market are factors that make it difficult to predict stock prices, and how to resolve them is the key to the stock price prediction model. Existing stock price prediction research has often used technical indicators. Recently, macroeconomic indicators have also been taken into consideration, and in order to understand the market impact, news information or investor psychology is reflected. There is also a trend to analyze sentiment in the stock community. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find a deep learning model that uses both internal and external factors that affect stock prices and creates higher predictive power through the inclusion of specific factors or combinations of factors. As a deep learning algorithm, LSTM suitable for time-series data learning was used. As a result of deep learning experiments, it does not seem possible to find a general-purpose model that can be applied to all stocks, but there are combinations of factors that increase the predictive power depending on the industry or price range, and results also shows that the recent data had better predictive power than the past data."

Text mining methods were employed to generate useful insights from existing literature. Composition/Logic: For applying a text mining method, the first step was to extract text from journal articles on supply chain risk management published in the Science Direct, Emerald, and Springer databases from 2015 to 2021. Then, the extracted word information was analyzed using machine learning models to identify the important implications. Findings: The findings are four-fold: 1) Word frequency analysis showed that several research topics have been dealt with minimizing the damage caused by supply chain disruption; 2) Word similarity analysis showed that the concept of risk management contained risk identification and assessment and then formulation of mitigation strategies; 3) Through LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) analysis, eight topics were derived, namely operational risk, types of disruption, risk assessment, risk mitigation, risk sharing, ripple effect, resilience, and company performance; 4) Through IDM(Intertopic Distance Map) analysis, the topic of operational risk is highly related to risk assessment and risk mitigation, but the topics on types of disruption, risk sharing, ripple effects, resilience, and corporate performance were found to have low correlations. Originality/Value: In previous research of machine learning models for supply chain risk management, the research was conducted mainly on abstracts or keywords. However, this study was analyzed by applying the machine learning models, including the main body of the paper in addition to abstracts and keywords.

To do this, separate fields according to characteristics for intrusion detection events, including payload. Extracts TF-IDF-based features for separated fields. After applying the mixed sampling technique based on the extracted features, a data set optimized for intrusion detection with imbalanced data is obtained through data visualization using t-SNE.

Considering the current degree of development of AI technology, it is thought that the issue of copyright infringement occurring in AI learning stage should be solved more urgently than the issue of copyright infringement occurring in use stage of AI output. Artificial intelligence learning step requires large-scale data input and the use of almost all works as data, making it difficult to solve with conventional fair use law. Accordingly legislative cases in each country, including South Korea, are trying to solve the issue of copyright infringement that may occur in the AI ​​learning stage by placing a new fair use clause or a clause allowing text data mining (TDM). On the other hand, I am of the view that copyright infringement that may occur in the stage of using AI output can be largely resolved by the existing laws of infringement and tort liability. However, even in this area, ""depending on the development of technology,"" there could be marginal cases that are difficult for existing legal principles to solve.Whether an artificial intelligence output has creativity or copyright- ability is a matter that is directly related to whether an artificial intelligence output can infringe on other's copyright. On one side of the view that the copyrightability of artificial intelligence output should be denied, it seems that the current artificial intelligence output can only be used in limited areas such as stock articles, weather articles, and sampling music. Looking at the level of AI(GAN) artwork, chatbot and language translation using NLP, it is necessary to examine in detail whether the AI ​​technology grasps the context from a semantic point of view, and whether creative individuality is expressed accordingly. It is my view that whether pattern recognition, numerical vectorization of characteristics, and probabilistic models adopted by artificial intelligence technology have reached the point where AI can understand human expressions from the viewpoint of semantics not syntactics should be judged legally in the concrete case. An abundance of these discussions will lead to appropriate conclusions on whether to provide legal protection for artificial intelligence output or who to hold legally liable for situations in which artificial intelligence output is believed to infringe on other people's copyrights.This study also discusses the legal nature of open-source license associated with the Edmond de Belamy portrait case. In the AI development process, open source is widely used in the form of open source-based development platforms such as TensorFlow, development tools, and machine learning libraries such as PyTorch. Since AI development requires extensive human and material resources, it is taking an open source community-based development method in which various developers can participate. Regarding the legal treatment of artificial intelligence's achievements and output, it is also necessary to note the legal nature of open-source license applied in the development and distribution process of AI output."

식도 및 위 질환의 인공지능 적용,2021,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Deep learning', 'Endoscopy', 'Gastroenterology']",,"In the past, conventional machine learning was applied to analyze tabulated medical data while deep learning was applied to study afflictions such as gastrointestinal disorders. Neural networks were used to detect, classify, and delineate various images of lesions because the local feature selection and optimization of the deep learning model enabled accurate image analysis. With the accumulation of medical records, the evolution of computational power and graphics processing units, and the widespread use of open-source libraries in large-scale machine learning processes, medical artificial intelligence (AI) is overcoming its limitations. While early studies prioritized the automatic diagnosis of cancer or pre-cancerous lesions, the current expanded scope of AI includes benign lesions, quality control, and machine learning analysis of big data. However, the limited commercialization of medical AI and the need to justify its application in each field of research are restricting factors. Modeling assumes that observations follow certain statistical rules, and external validation checks whether assumption is correct or generalizable.

Since corruption is a significant problem that can affect corporate performance, particularly in emerging markets, it is important to correctly identify whether a company engages in corrupt practices. Design/methodology/approach - In order to address the research question, we employ predictive analytic techniques (machine learning methods). Using the World Bank Enterprise Survey Data, this study evaluates various predictive models generated by seven supervised learning algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Decision Rules (DR), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Findings - We find that DT, DR, SVM and ANN create highly accurate models (over 90% of accuracy). Among various factors, firm age is the most significant, while several other determinants such as source of working capital, top manager experience, and the number of permanent full-time employees also contribute to company corruption. Research implications or Originality - This research successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict corporate corruption and also identifies the major causes of corporate corruption."

However, since it is virtually impossible to collect and use a large amount of data with prior permission from the copyright holder, the problem of copyright infringement inevitably arises because the data must be collected and used mechanically without the permission of the copyright holder. Therefore, free use of works is required for the development of artificial intelligence technology, and due to concerns that legal regul- ations to promote the use of big data works under the current copyright law system are not clear, it is considering the establishment of a new copyright limitations and exceptions. However, the provisions of copyright limitations and exceptions to be newly established in accordance with the complete revision of the current copyright law, the collection and use of works by artificial intelligence does not enjoy human thoughts or emotions expressed in the works. It is limited to the case of “copying and transmission for data analysis” within the scope of not adversely affecting the value of the work or the market as ‘non-expressive use’. Therefore, the legal judgment will be more complicated in the case of artificial intelligence, which generates ""expression"" that conveys human thoughts and emotions rather than the scope of specific provision for copyright limitations. In the case of “rejecting fair use”, there is a risk of impeding the technological development of artificial intelligence, or in the case of “determining fair use” the rights of human creators related to works that enable the execution of artificial intelligence are deprived. The reason is that with the development of ICT technology, users of works from a traditional perspective now change to the position of the creator of the work and explicitly grant permission to online platforms for their user-created content (UCC) in exchange for free online platform services. Therefore, online media platforms do not have copyrights on numerous contents, but rather become licensees of the contents uploaded by each platform user, who is a copyright holder, and perform machine learning based on them. These Tech Giant can extract value from copyright holders' protected expression without per- mission and use that value for commercial purposes that could one day jeopardize human creators' livelihoods. Of course, artificial intelligence will realize tremendous social and economic benefits, but a large portion of these benefits come from human creative works, requiring a new balance point to enhance distributive fairness suitable for the age of artificial intelligence.

In the past, e-government has implemented various public services through Internet and brought innovation in administrative affairs. Intelligent informatization in administration takes one step more to make automatic administrative decisions by using artificial intelligence in various fields of administration. In this paper, we examine the aspects of regulations and remedy of rights in automatic administrative decisions with artificial intelligence.In the case of automatic administrative decisions with artificial intelligence, regulations and remedy of rights may vary depending on various types of administrative actions, such as administrative disposition, public contracts, realakte, and administrative rules. When establishing the the regulations of automatic administrative decisions with artificial intelligence, lawmakers should consider rule of law, administrative procedures, opacity and bias of machine learning algorithms, and personal information protection. When making administrative disposition with artificial intelligence, it is reasonable to allow discretionary actions as well as binding actions considering the nature of AI. In order to enforce public contracts and realakte with artificial intelligence, legal grounds will be required. Automatic administrative rules with artificial intelligence will be allowed only when there is social consensus based on democratic legitimacy. When referring to overseas regulatory trends, it is necessary to recognize the right to object against automatic administrative decisions and to grant the right to request an explanation of the AI′s algorithms. On the other hand, it is necessary to keep in mind the principles of science and technology regulation, such as so-called negative regulation-a method of specifically enumerating the rights limited and permitting other matters in principle.Regarding the remedy of rights, the current law does not reflect the automatic administrative decision with artificial intelligence, so remedy of rights is insufficient. In relation to state compensation liability, if public officials using artificial intelligence inflict damage on other persons, the negligence of public officials should be presumed. If damage occurs in public structures due to artificial intelligence errors, defects should be presumed when the probability of the defects is proved. When it comes to an appeal suit, automatic administrative decisions with artificial intelligence-for example, machine learning algorithms that reflect specific disposition criteria- should be recognized as administrative disposition. With regard to the illegality of administrative disposition, the issues are rule of law, administrative procedures, opacity and bias of machine learning algorithms, personal information protection, etc. In addition, a party suit should be used for state compensation claims or public contracts."

Besides, companies that develop, distribute, or utilize innovative new technologies such as artificial intelligence have a problem that it is difficult to accurately predict a companys future stock returns and volatility due to macro-environment and market uncertainty. Market uncertainty is recognized as an obstacle to the activation and spread of artificial intelligence technology, so research is needed to mitigate this. Hence, the purpose of this study is to propose a machine learning model that predicts the volatility of a companys stock price by using the internet search volume of artificial intelligence-related technology keywords as a measure of the interest of investors. To this end, for predicting the stock market, we using the VAR(Vector Auto Regression) and deep neural network LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). And the stock price prediction performance using keyword search volume is compared according to the technologys social acceptance stage. In addition, we also conduct the analysis of sub-technology of artificial intelligence technology to examine the change in the search volume of detailed technology keywords according to the technology acceptance stage and the effect of interest in specific technology on the stock market forecast.

Next, we investigated how many keywords each week appeared in online documents for five years from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. The stock price and transaction volume data of KOSDAQ listed companies were also collected and used for analysis. As a result, we found that the keyword search volume for artificial intelligence technology increased as the social acceptance of artificial intelligence technology increased. In particular, starting from AlphaGo Shock, the keyword search volume for artificial intelligence itself and detailed technologies such as machine learning and deep learning appeared to increase. Also, the keyword search volume for artificial intelligence technology increases as the social acceptance stage progresses. It showed high accuracy, and it was confirmed that the acceptance stages showing the best prediction performance were different for each keyword. As a result of stock price prediction based on keyword search volume for each social acceptance stage of artificial intelligence technologies classified in this study, the awareness stages prediction accuracy was found to be the highest. The prediction accuracy was different according to the keywords used in the stock price prediction model for each social acceptance stage. Therefore, when constructing a stock price prediction model using technology keywords, it is necessary to consider social acceptance of the technology and sub-technology classification. The results of this study provide the following implications. First, to predict the return on investment for companies based on innovative technology, it is most important to capture the recognition stage in which public interest rapidly increases in social acceptance of the technology. Second, the change in keyword search volume and the accuracy of the prediction model varies according to the social acceptance of technology should be considered in developing a Decision Support System for investment such as the big data-based Robo-advisor recently introduced by the financial sector."

However, currently, most crack detection relies only on human judgment, so if the area of the facility is large, cost and time are excessively used, and different judgment results may occur depending on the expert""s competence, it causes reliability problems. This paper proposes a concrete crack detection framework based on machine learning to overcome these limitations. Fully automated concrete crack detection was possible through the proposed framework, which showed a high accuracy of 96%. It is expected that effective and efficient management will be possible through the proposed framework in this paper."

Performance Comparison of Korean Dialect Classification Models Based on Acoustic Features,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'MFCC', 'Dialect Classification', 'Speech Analysis', '머신 러닝', '딥러닝', '방언 분류', '성능 비교', '음성 분석']",,"Using the acoustic features of speech, important social and linguistic information about the speaker can be obtained, and one of the key features is the dialect. A speakers use of a dialect is a major barrier to interaction with a computer. Dialects can be distinguished at various levels such as phonemes, syllables, words, phrases, and sentences, but it is difficult to distinguish dialects by identifying them one by one. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lightweight Korean dialect classification model using only MFCC among the features of speech data. We study the optimal method to utilize MFCC features through Korean conversational voice data, and compare the classification performance of five Korean dialects in Gyeonggi/Seoul, Gangwon, Chungcheong, Jeolla, and Gyeongsang in eight machine learning and deep learning classification models. The performance of most classification models was improved by normalizing the MFCC, and the accuracy was improved by 1.07% and F1-score by 2.04% compared to the best performance of the classification model before normalizing the MFCC."

For the maximization of correntropy criterion (MCC) as one of the ITL-type criteria, several methods of adapting the remaining kernel size (σ) after removing the term have been studied. In this paper, it is shown that the main cause of sensitivity in choosing the kernel size derives from the term and that the adaptive adjustment of in the remaining terms leads to approach the absolute value of error, which prevents the weight adjustment from continuing. Thus, it is proposed that choosing an appropriate constant as the kernel size for the remaining terms is more effective. In addition, the experiment results when compared to the conventional algorithm show that the proposed method enhances learning performance by about 2dB of steady state MSE with the same convergence rate. In an experiment for channel models, the proposed method enhances performance by 4 dB so that the proposed method is more suitable for more complex or inferior conditions."

However, DNNs sometimes misrecognize certain adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a sample that adds optimized noise to the original data, which makes the DNN erroneously misclassified, although there is nothing wrong with the human eye. Therefore studies on defense against adversarial example attacks are required.

For this purpose, the 7th data of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing(KLoSA) was used, and a total of 60 variables including the life satisfaction of older adults were finally used for the analysis. The explanatory variables were largely composed of demographic background, family (children and grandchildren, parents and siblings), health, employment, income and consumption, assets, and subjective expectations. For the analysis method, random forest was used to derive variables with high importance among 59 explanatory variables, and multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship between major variables and life satisfaction. The main results are as follows. First, a random forest analysis using 500 trees and 13 split variables showed that the degree of depression, average monthly allowance, subjective perception of social hierarchy, life expectancy, subjective health, number of grandchildren, age, job expectation, personal wealth, total amount of money received. The relative importance of the 10 variables was the highest. Second, as a result of analyzing the partial dependence on life satisfaction of older adults according to the top 10 variables of importance, the patterns of influence on life satisfaction by each variable were very different. Third, as a result of performing multiple regression analysis by inputting the top 10 variables of importance, it was found that the monthly average pocket money had the greatest influence on life satisfaction, followed by subjective perception of social hierarchy, subjective health, and life expectancy. However, these results may be slightly different from the partial dependence results, indicating that not only regression analysis but also partial dependence analysis should be considered in order to comprehensively examine the effects of related variables on life satisfaction of older adults. Based on the above results, the recommendations of this study are as follows. First, research on the lives of older adults needs to be analyzed from a more comprehensive perspective. Second, in addition to the current working status used in the analysis of this study, additional analysis is needed on the variables related to employment of older adults. Third, based on the research results, policy support for the lives of older adults should be provided from more diverse aspects"

Sometimes, the input data is too complicated for the models to learn useful patterns. Therefore, feature engineering is a crucial data preprocessing step for constructing a proper feature set to improve the performance of such models. One of the most efficient methods for automating feature engineering is the autoencoder, which transforms the data from its original space into a latent space. However certain factors, including the datasets, the machine learning models, and the number of dimensions of the latent space (denoted by k), should be carefully considered when using the autoencoder. In this study, we design a framework to compare two data preprocessing approaches: with and without autoencoder and to observe the impact of these factors on autoencoder. We then conduct experiments using autoencoders with classifiers on popular datasets. The empirical results provide a perspective regarding the best suited autoencoder for these factors."

The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to evaluate driving safety using only the subject vehicle’s trajectory data. To evaluate the driving safety of the subject vehicle, the speed, acceleration, and jerk of the subject vehicle were utilized as driving information, and the Stopping Distance Index (SDI) was employed as a SSM. Furthermore, for the development of the driving safety evaluation algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), a machine learning technique, was utilized as a classifier.

However, the current feedback system requires too much human inputs to improve the running model and even so, those feedback from inexperienced analysts can affect the model performance negatively. Therefore, we propose “active model improving feedback technology” to solve the shortage of security analyst manpower, increasing false positive rates and degrading model performance. First, we cluster similar predicted events during the operation, calculate feedback priorities for those clusters and select and provide representative events from those highly prioritized clusters using XAI (eXplainable AI)-based event visualization. Once these events are feedbacked, we exclude less analogous events and then propagate the feedback throughout the clusters. Finally, these events are incrementally trained by an existing model. To verify the effectiveness of our proposal, we compared three distinct scenarios using PKDD2007 and CSIC2012. As a result, our proposal confirmed a 30% higher performance in all indicators compared to that of the model with no feedback and the current feedback system."

At NMCS, the H-RDT (HR) based on the Himawari-8 satellite and the K-RDT (KR) which combines the GK2A convection initiation output with the RDT were developed. In this study, we optimized the KR (KU) to improve the detection level of thunderstorms occurring in Korea. For this, we used all available data, such as GK2A/AMI, RADAR, lightning, and numerical model data from the recent two years (2019-2020). The machine learning of logistic regression and stepwise variable selection was used to optimize the KU algorithms. For considering the developing stages and duration time of thunderstorms, and data availability of GK2A/AMI, a total of 72 types of detection algorithms were developed. The level of detection of the KR, HR, and KU was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using lightning and RADAR data. Visual inspection using the lightning and RADAR data showed that all three algorithms detect thunderstorms that occurred in Korea well. However, the level of detection differs according to the lightning frequency and day/night, and the higher the frequency of lightning, the higher the detection level is. And the level of detection is generally higher at night than day. The quantitative verification of KU using lightning (RADAR) data showed that POD and FAR are 0.70 (0.34) and 0.57 (0.04), respectively. The verification results showed that the detection level of KU is slightly better than that of KR and HR."

This technique is also rapidly improving performance using a machine learning method, and a high possibility of utilizing information in units of pixels is drawing attention. However, this technology has been raised from the early days until recently for ‘lack of detailed segmentation’ problem. Since this problem was caused by increasing the size of the label map, it was expected that the label map could be improved by using the edge map of the original image with detailed edge information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a post-processing algorithm that maintains semantic image segmentation based on learning, but modifies the resulting label map based on the edge map of the original image. After applying the algorithm to the existing method, when comparing similar applications before and after, approximately 1.74% pixels and 1.35% IoU (Intersection of Union) were applied, and when analyzing the results, the precise targeting fine segmentation function was improved."

Secondly, in the Machine Learning literature, the deep convolutional neural networks are able to extract relevant features from input data, then perform classification tasks with high accuracy and reduced time complexity.

COMPAS의 도입･시행 이후, 이 알고리즘을 둘러싼 논란과 여러 비판에서 보듯 미국에서 널리 사용되고 있는 COMPAS는 인종차별적인 결과를 내는 등 문제점이 많은 것으로 드러났다. 인공지능의 블랙박스 속성 때문에 COMPAS의 작동 기제를 알지 못한다. 편향적 결과로 인해 피해를 본 사람도 이와 같은 블랙박스 속성 때문에 그 결과를 탄핵할 수 없다. 이러한 블랙박스로 인한 인공지능 알고리즘의 문제점을 해결하려는 해법이 필요하다. 그 해법의 가장 큰 줄기가 바로 ‘설명 가능한 인공지능’이다. 설명가능 인공지능은 인공지능이 내린 의사결정의 이유를 사람이 이해할 수 있는 방식으로 제시하는 인공지능을 일컫는다. 인공지능의 발전에 상당한 기여를 했다는 평가를 받고 있는 미 방위고등연구계획국은 몇 년 전부터 이러한 설명 가능한 인공지능 연구에 대해 막대한 지원을 하고 있다.물론 인공지능 연구자 중에는 설명 가능한 인공지능의 가치에 대해 의문을 던지고 있는 이도 있다. 심지어 인간의 의사결정과정도 쉽게 설명될 수 있는 것이 아니라며, 인공지능의 의사결정 과정의 설명 가능성과 실용성 모두를 의문시한다. 이런 회의론 에도 불구하고, 법 분야에서 인간의 의사결정을 대체하는 수준의 인공지능 알고리즘이 개발되고, 자리 잡기 위해서는 설명 가능한 인공지능 과제는 반드시 해결되어야 한다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 이러한 설명 가능한 인공지능의 개념과 그것이 법 분야 인공지능 알고리즘 구현과 활용에 얼마나 중요한지를 따져보고, 그것의 실현가능성을 점쳐 본다.이런 설명 가능한 인공지능으로 인하여 편향성이나 차별 등 공정성 가치를 저해하는 등 여러 가지 문제점이 해결될 것으로 기대한다.","Artificial intelligence, in particular, machine learning algorithms are used not only in the medical field or finance field, but also in the law field to predict the risk of recidivism, predict crime, and improve legal services. The most problematic aspect of such artificial intelligence is the black box problem, which is that humans do not properly understand the mechanism of operation of artificial intelligence. The inner workings of deep learning or machine learning architectures are becoming increasingly complex and opaque. As is the case in other fields, in the field of law, a system is essential to ensure transparency in the decision-making process of artificial intelligence, and to explain the decision-making process to non-experts. Decision-making in the field of law is because not only the outcome, but also its procedural justification is very important. The recidivism risk prediction algorithm COMPAS, which is mentioned as a representative case of decision-making algorithms in the legal field, is used for determining whether to release a defendant or determining a sentence. Since the introduction and implementation of COMPAS, as seen in the controversy and criticisms surrounding this algorithm, COMPAS, which is widely used in the United States, has been found to have many problems, such as racist results. Due to the black box nature of artificial intelligence, we do not know the mechanism of COMPAS. Even those who have suffered damage due to the biased result cannot challenge the result because of the black box property. There is a need for a solution to solve the problem of artificial intelligence algorithms caused by such black boxes. The biggest stem of the solution is ‘explainable artificial intelligence'. Explainable artificial intelligence refers to artificial intelligence that presents the reasons for decisions made by artificial intelligence in a way that humans can understand. The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), which is considered to have made a significant contribution to the advancement of artificial intelligence, began to provide enormous support for such explanatory artificial intelligence research several years ago.Of course, some of the AI researchers are questioning the value of explainable AI. Even the human decision-making process cannot be explained easily, and they question both the explanatory feasibility and practicality of the decision-making process of artificial intelligence. Despite this skepticism, in order to develop and establish an artificial intelligence algorithm at a level that replaces human decision-making in the field of law, an explainable AI task must be solved. Therefore, in this study, the concept of explainable artificial intelligence and how important it is to the implementation and application of artificial intelligence algorithms in the legal field, and its feasibility are examined.It is expected that a large number of problems that hinder fairness values such as bias and discrimination will be solved by such explainable artificial intelligence. Apart from that, I would like to discuss with you whether there is a way to solve the problem of impairing fairness value caused by artificial intelligence algorithms."

In this study, water surface elevation prediction algorithm was developed using the LSTM (Long Short-term Memory) technique specialized for time series data among Machine Learning to estimate and prevent flooding of the facilities. The study area is Jamsu Bridge, the study period is 6 years (2015~2020) of June, July and August and the water surface elevation of the Jamsu Bridge after 3 hours was predicted. Input data set is composed of the water surface elevation of Jamsu Bridge (EL.m), the amount of discharge from Paldang Dam (m3/s), the tide level of Ganghwa Bridge (cm) and the number of tweets in Seoul. Complementary data were constructed by using not only structured data mainly used in precedent research but also unstructured data constructed through wordcloud, and the role of unstructured data was presented through comparison and analysis of whether or not unstructured data was used. When predicting the water surface elevation of the Jamsu Bridge, the accuracy of prediction was improved and realized that complementary data could be conservative alerts to reduce casualties. In this study, it was concluded that the use of complementary data was relatively effective in providing the user’s safety and convenience of riverside infrastructure. In the future, more accurate water surface elevation prediction would be expected through the addition of types of unstructured data or detailed pre-processing of input data."

Metabolic Subtyping of Adrenal Tumors: Prospective Multi-Center Cohort Study in Korea,2021,"['Steroid metabolism', 'Supervised machine learning', 'Adrenal neoplasms', 'Cushing syndrome', 'Primary hyperaldosteronism']",,"Background: Conventional diagnostic approaches for adrenal tumors require multi-step processes, including imaging studies anddynamic hormone tests. Therefore, this study aimed to discriminate adrenal tumors from a single blood sample based on the combination of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and machine learning algorithms in serum profiling of adrenal steroids.Methods: The LC-MS-based steroid profiling was applied to serum samples obtained from patients with nonfunctioning adenoma(NFA, n=73), Cushing’s syndrome (CS, n=30), and primary aldosteronism (PA, n=40) in a prospective multicenter study of adrenaldisease. The decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) were performed to categorize the subtypes of adrenal tumors.Results: The CS group showed higher serum levels of 11-deoxycortisol than the NFA group, and increased levels of tetrahydrocortisone (THE), 20α-dihydrocortisol, and 6β-hydroxycortisol were found in the PA group. However, the CS group showed lower levelsof dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate derivative (DHEA-S) than both the NFA and PA groups. Patients with PA expressed higher serum 18-hydroxycortisol and DHEA but lower THE than NFA patients. The balanced accuracies of DT, RF, andXGBoost for classifying each type were 78%, 96%, and 97%, respectively. In receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis forCS, XGBoost, and RF showed a significantly greater diagnostic power than the DT. However, in ROC analysis for PA, only RF exhibited better diagnostic performance than DT.Conclusion: The combination of LC-MS-based steroid profiling with machine learning algorithms could be a promising one-stepdiagnostic approach for the classification of adrenal tumor subtypes."

Predictive model for PV power generation using RNN (LSTM),2021,['· Recurrent neural network · Deep learning · Model predictive control · Renewable energy · PV power generation'],,"In recent years, advanced information technologies, such as deep learning and big data, have been actively applied in building energy management systems to improve energy efficiency. Various studies have been conducted on the prediction of renewable energy performance using machine learning techniques. In this study, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was utilized in predicting photovoltaic (PV) power generation. An RNN is an artificial neural network in which the connection between units is composed of a cyclic structure that can reflect the characteristics of time series. Therefore, to eventually incorporate a model predictive control technique for energy demand and supply matching, this study uses previously measured weather data and PV power generation data to predict the future PV power generation.Various optimization processes, such as normalization, classification of learning data, and setting of layer options, are performed to create a predictive model. Furthermore, 500 hidden neurons and 1 and 3 hidden layers are created and compared. The initial learning rate for both single and multiple-layer options was set to 0.05. As a result, the coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error, Cv(RMSE), which is a statistical index to assess the overall accuracy of the predicted values, was 13.8 % for a single layer and 13.2 % for a multiple-layer long short term memory model. Although no significant difference was observed between the two models, the multiple-layer model showed a slightly reduced error rate than the single-layer model, and the accurate prediction was confirmed to be achievable. Based on this study, a stable energy supply system can be established through linkage with energy storage control by predicting the amount of energy production through renewable energy sources and the amount of energy demand at urban scale."

Based on the taxi DTG data that recorded the driving route from the taxi user’s entry point to the exit point, the ride rate analysis result was visualized as a heat map. The main travel routes of taxi users were found through the driving route. As a result of the loading rate analysis, it was confirmed that the loading rate was high in Dongseong-ro, the downtown area of Daegu Metropolitan City, and the nearby area of Dongdaegu Station. The following high passenger rate region was analyzed as the region with a high proportion of commercial facilities. In the case of movement routes, it was confirmed that they appear mainly along the same axis as subway lines and major arterial roads in the city. And through this, it was possible to obtain the implication that the infrastructure for shared autonomous vehicles could be built along arterial roads, auxiliary arterial roads, and subway lines in the future. In addition, this study established a regression model using machine learning techniques such as Random forest and LightGBM to confirm the variables that affect the user’s choice to use a taxi. The distance to the subway station, the arterial road, the number of floating population, the card sales performance, and the distance to the bus stop were derived as the primary variables that affect the decision of the taxi route. As a result of model estimation, it was found that both regression models secured the fit. It is expected that the results of this study can be utilized to strategically arrange essential infrastructure related to the driving of shared autonomous vehicles in consideration of changes in these influencing variables."

In this study, data extracted from acceleration sensor and current sensor were obtained through experiments in the cutting process of SKD11, which is widely used as a material for special mold steel, and the amount of tool wear and product surface roughness were measured. SVR (Support Vector Regression) is applied to predict the roughness of the product surface in real time using the obtained data. SVR, a machine learning technique, is widely used for linear and non-linear prediction using the concept of kernel. In particular, by applying GSVQR (Generalized Support Vector Quantile Regression), overestimation, underestimation, and neutral estimation of product surface roughness are performed and compared. Furthermore, surface roughness is predicted using the linear kernel and the RBF kernel. In terms of accuracy, the results of the RBF kernel are better than those of the linear kernel. Since it is difficult to predict the amount of tool wear in real time, the product surface roughness is predicted with acceleration and current data excluding the amount of tool wear. In terms of accuracy, the results of excluding the amount of tool wear were not significantly different from those including the amount of tool wear."

The development of deep learning technology has dramatically improved the performance of image classifiers. However, if the images are contaminated by noise, the performance degrades rapidly. Noise added to the image is inevitably generated in the process of obtaining and transmitting the image. Therefore, in order to use the classifier in a real environment, we have to deal with the noise. On the other hand, the autoencoder is an artificial neural network model that is trained to have similar input and output values. If the input data is similar to the training data, the error between the input data and output data of the autoencoder will be small. However, if the input data is not similar to the training data, the error will be large. The proposed system uses the relationship between the input data and the output data of the autoencoder, and it has two phases to classify the images. In the first phase, the classes with the highest likelihood of classification are selected and subject to the procedure again in the second phase. For the performance analysis of the proposed system, classification accuracy was tested on a Gaussian noise-contaminated MNIST dataset. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the proposed system in the noisy environment has higher accuracy than the CNN-based classification technique."

Tree-Based Ensemble Methods: Predicting Asphalt Mixture Dynamic Modulus for Flexible Pavement Design,2021,"['Dynamic modulus', 'Ensemble method', 'Machine learning', 'MEPDG', 'Flexible Pavement']",,"The hot mix asphalt (HMA) dynamic modulus (|E*|), or stress/strain response measurement under dynamic loading, is considered the primary mechanical property input for flexible pavement in the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). The current MEPDG software, AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design (PMED) Version 2.5, employs the Witczak equation for |E*| estimation when laboratory-measured |E*| data is unavailable. This study investigates the feasibility of developing alternative |E*| prediction models with modern machine learning techniques based on an established data library of Georgia HMA mixtures involving varying binder sources, binder grades, and nominal maximum aggregate sizes. Specifically, tree-based ensemble methods, including bagging, random forest, and gradient boosting, were applied considering their superior performance, and balanced versatility and interpretability. The results revealed that the gradient boosting model produced the most accurate predictions with an R2 coefficient of determination of 0.982 as compared to the nationally calibrated Witczak model, which has an R2 of 0.392, using the same test data set. The stark discrepancy in the |E*| predictions emphasizes the need of local calibration for the MEPDG models and the high potential for developing greatly improved models using modern machine learning techniques with the local data sources. Ultimately, this study provides an excellent example for other state highway agencies to follow to facilitate their MEPDG implementation."

To overcome the difficulty in obtaining fall data, this study proposes an algorithm that efficiently learns less data through machine learning such as KNN (k-nearest neighbors) and SVM (support vector machine). In addition, to improve the performance of these mathematical classifiers, this study utilized feature data aquired in the frequency space. The proposed algorithm analyzed the effect by diversifying the parameters of the model and the parameters of the frequency feature extractor through experiments using standard datasets. The proposed algorithm could adequately cope with a realistic problem that fall data are difficult to obtain.

In addition to the ASOS in-situ observations, we used CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 and ERA5 reanalysis. From the multiple meteorological datasets, we extracted the four common variables (air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation) and analyzed the characteristics of each data and the associations with rice yields. CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 showed an overall agreement with the other datasets. While relative humidity had a rare relationship with rice yields, solar radiation showed a somewhat high correlation with rice yields. Using the air temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation of July, August, and September, we built a random forest model for the hindcast experiments of rice yields. The model with CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 showed the best performance with a correlation coefficient of 0.772.

The correntropy algorithm, one of the ITL methods, has superior properties of impulsive-noise robustness and channel-distortion compensation. On the other hand, it is also sensitive to the kernel sizes that can lead to system instability. In this paper, considering the sensitivity of the kernel size cubed in the denominator of the cost function slope, a new adaptive kernel estimation method using the rate of change in error power in respect to the kernel size variation is proposed for the correntropy algorithm. In a distortion-compensation experiment for impulsive-noise and multipath-distorted channel, the performance of the proposed kernel-adjusted correntropy algorithm was examined. The proposed method shows a two times faster convergence speed than the conventional algorithm with a fixed kernel size. In addition, the proposed algorithm converged appropriately for kernel sizes ranging from 2.0 to 6.0. Hence, the proposed method has a wide acceptable margin of initial kernel sizes."

According to the necessity of efficient and wide-area forestry remote sensing, CAS500-4 (Compact Advanced Satellite 500-4; The agriculture and forestry satellite) project has been confirmed and scheduled for launch in 2023. Before launching and utilizing CAS500-4, this study aimed to pre-evaluation the possibility of satellite-based tree species classification using RapidEye, which has similar specifications to the CAS500-4. In this study, the study area was the Chuncheon forest management complex, Gangwon-do. The spectral information was extracted from the growing season image. And the GLCM texture information was derived from the growing and non-growing seasons NIR bands. Both information were used to classification with random forest machine learning method. In this study, tree species were classified into nine classes to the coniferous tree (Korean red pine, Korean pine, Japanese larch), broad-leaved trees (Mongolian oak, Oriental cork oak, East Asian white birch, Korean Castanea, and other broadleaved trees), and mixed forest. Finally, the classification accuracy was calculated by comparing the forest type map and classification results. As a result, the accuracy was 39.41% when only spectral information was used and 69.29% when both spectral information and texture information was used. For future study, the applicability of the CAS500-4 will be improved by substituting additional variables that more effectively reflect vegetation’s ecological characteristics."

Statistical techniques and machine learning methods allow us to identify and focus on fundamental environmental variables that have close relationships with NPS pollutants of interest. This study developed surrogate models to predict the concentrations of suspended sediment (SS) and total phosphorus (T-P) from turbidity and runoff discharge rates using multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) methods. The RF models provided acceptable performance in predicting SS and T-P, especially when runoff discharge rates were high. The RF models outperformed the MLR models in all the cases. Such finding highlights the potential of RF techniques and models as a tool to identify fundamental environmental variables that are measured in relatively inexpensive ways or freely available but still able to provide information required to quantify the concentrations of NPS pollutants. The analysis of relative importance rates showed that the temporal variations of SS and T-P concentrations could be more effectively explained by that of turbidity than runoff discharge rate. This study demonstrated that the advanced statistical techniques such as machine learning could help to improve the efficiency of NPS pollutants monitoring."

An Edge-based Stochastic Proximal Gradient Algorithm for Decentralized Composite Optimization,2021,"['Decentralized composite optimization', 'linear convergence', 'machine learning', 'proximal-gradient method', 'stochastic averaging gradient.']",,"This paper investigates decentralized composite optimization problems involving a common non-smooth regularization term over an undirected and connected network. In the same situation, there exist lots of gradientbased proximal distributed methods, but most of them are only sublinearly convergent. The proof of linear convergence for this series of algorithms is extremely difficult. To set up the problem, we presume all networked agents use the same non-smooth regularization term, which is the circumstance for most machine learning to implement based on centralized optimization. For this scenario, most existing proximal-gradient algorithms trend to ignore the cost of gradient evaluations, which results in degraded performance. To tackle this problem, we further set the local cost function to the average of a moderate amount of local cost subfunctions and develop an edge-based stochastic proximal gradient algorithm (SPG-Edge) by employing local unbiased stochastic averaging gradient method. When the non-smooth term does not exist, the proposed algorithm could be extended to some notable primal-dual domain algorithms, such as EXTRA and DIGing. Finally, we provide a simplified proof of linear convergence and conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the validity of theoretical results."

Fecal pollution is especially harmful as it disperses pathogenic bacteria into waterways. Unraveling origins of mixed sources of fecal bacteria is difficult and microbial source tracking (MST) in complex environments is still a daunting task.

Advancements in qPCR and next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have shifted the traditional culture-based MST approaches towards culture independent technologies, where communitybased MST is becoming a method of choice. Metagenomic tools may be useful to overcome some of the limitations of community-based MST methods as they can give deep insight into identifying host specific fecal markers and their association with different environments. Adoption of machine learning (ML) algorithms, along with the metagenomic based MST approaches, will also provide a statistically robust and automated platform. To compliment that, ML-based approaches provide accurate optimization of resources. With the successful application of ML based models in disease prediction, outbreak investigation and medicine prescription, it would be possible that these methods would serve as a better surrogate of traditional MST approaches in future."

We adopt multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) as machine learning models, and consider three types of beads: normal bead, abnormal bead with balling effects, and abnormal bead with cuts. After capturing voltage signatures while building weld beads, we separated each voltage signature into 17 to 19 segments, from each of which a set of features are extracted. We then constructed training and test data with feature datasets. We built total 75 voltage signatures: 45 for normal beads, 15 for abnormal beads with balling effects, and 15 for abnormal beads with cuts.

To address this issue, this study developed risk prediction models of serious accidents in construction sites using five machine learning methods: support vector machine, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and AutoML. To this end, 15 proactive information (e.g., number of stories and period of construction) that are usually available prior to construction were considered and two over-sampling techniques (SMOTE and ADASYN) were used to address the problem of class-imbalanced data. The results showed that all machine learning methods achieved 0.876~0.941 in the F1-score with the adoption of over-sampling techniques. LightGBM with ADASYN yielded the best prediction performance in both the F1-score (0.941) and the area under the ROC curve (0.941). The prediction models revealed four major features: number of stories, period of construction, excavation depth, and height. The prediction models developed in this study can be useful both for government agencies in prioritizing construction sites for safety inspection and for construction companies in establishing pre-construction preventive measures."
Identification of Profane Words in Cyberbullying Incidents within Social Networks,2021,"['cyberbullying', 'profane words', 'cybercrime', 'harassment', 'social network', 'machine learning']",,"The popularity of social networking sites (SNS) has facilitated communication between users. The usage of SNS helps users in their daily life in various ways such as sharing of opinions, keeping in touch with old friends, making new friends, and getting information. However, some users misuse SNS to belittle or hurt others using profanities, which is typical in cyberbullying incidents. Thus, in this study, we aim to identify profane words from the ASKfm corpus to analyze the profane word distribution across four different roles involved in cyberbullying based on lexicon dictionary. These four roles are: harasser, victim, bystander that assists the bully, and bystander that defends the victim. Evaluation in this study focused on occurrences of the profane word for each role from the corpus. The top 10 common words used in the corpus are also identified and represented in a graph. Results from the analysis show that these four roles used profane words in their conversation with different weightage and distribution, even though the profane words used are mostly similar. The harasser is the first ranked that used profane words in the conversation compared to other roles. The results can be further explored and considered as a potential feature in a cyberbullying detection model using a machine learning approach. Results in this work will contribute to formulate the suitable representation. It is also useful in modeling a cyberbullying detection model based on the identification of profane word distribution across different cyberbullying roles in social networks for future works."

In this study, a braking distance prediction model according to the driving speed and loading weight of a three-axis truck was implemented to prevent a forward collision accident. Learning data was generated based on simulation, and a prediction model based on machine learning was implemented to finally verify accuracy. The extra trees algorithm was selected based on the most frequently used R2 Score among regression analyses, and the accuracy of the braking distance prediction model was 98.065% through 10 random scenarios."
Social Network Analysis of an Online Smoking Cessation Community to Identify Users’ Smoking Status,2021,"['Smoking Cessation', 'Social Networking', 'Social Media', 'Machine Learning', 'Neural Networks']",,"Objectives: Users share valuable information through online smoking cessation communities (OSCCs), which help peoplemaintain and improve smoking cessation behavior. Although OSCC utilization is common among smokers, limitations existin identifying the smoking status of OSCC users (“quit” vs. “not quit”). Thus, the current study implicitly analyzed user-generatedcontent (UGC) to identify individual users’ smoking status through advanced computational methods and real datafrom an OSCC. Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted using data from 3,833 users of BcomeAnEX.org. Domainexperts reviewed posts and comments to determine the authors’ smoking status when they wrote them. Seven types of featuresets were extracted from UGC (textual, Doc2Vec, social influence, domain-specific, author-based, and thread-based features,as well as adjacent posts). Results: Introducing novel features boosted smoking status recognition (quit vs. not quit) by 9.3%relative to the use of text-only post features. Furthermore, advanced computational methods outperformed baseline algorithmsacross all models and increased the smoking status prediction performance by up to 12%. Conclusions: The results ofthis study suggest that the current research method provides a valuable platform for researchers involved in online cessationinterventions and furnishes a framework for on-going machine learning applications. The results may help practitioners designa sustainable real-time intervention via personalized post recommendations in OSCCs. A major limitation is that onlyusers’ smoking status was detected. Future research might involve programming machine learning classification methods toidentify abstinence duration using larger datasets."
사이버비행 요인 파악 및 예측모델 개발: 혼합방법론 접근,2021,"['Juvenile cyber deviance', 'Econometric analysis', 'Deep learning']",,"PurposeCyber deviance of adolescents has become a serious social problem. With a widespread use of smartphones, incidents of cyber deviance have increased in Korea and both quantitative and qualitative damages such as suicide and depression are increasing. Research has been conducted to understand diverse factors that explain adolescents’ delinquency in cyber space. However, most previous studies have focused on a single theory or perspective. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively analyze motivations of juvenile cyber deviance and to develop a predictive model for delinquent adolescents by integrating four different theories on cyber deviance.Design/methodology/approachBy using data from Korean Children & Youth Panel Survey 2010, this study extracts 27 potential factors for cyber deivance based on four background theories including general strain, social learning, social bonding, and routine activity theories. Then this study employs econometric analysis to empirically assess the impact of potential factors and utilizes a machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of cyber deviance by adolescents.FindingsThis study found that general strain factors as well as social learning factors have positive effects on cyber deviance. Routine activity-related factors such as real-life delinquent behaviors and online activities also positively influence the likelihood of cyber diviance. On the other hand, social bonding factors such as community commitment and attachment to community lessen the likelihood of cyber deviance while social factors related to school activities are found to have positive impacts on cyber deviance. This study also found a predictive model using a deep learning algorithm indicates the highest prediction performance. This study contributes to the prevention of cyber deviance of teenagers in practice by understanding motivations for adolescents’ delinquency and predicting potential cyber deviants."
Malware Detection with Directed Cyclic Graph and Weight Merging,2021,"['malware detection', 'directed cyclic graph', 'Markov Chain', 'machine learning', 'neural network']",,"Malware is a severe threat to the computing system and there’s a long history of the battle between malware detection and anti-detection. Most traditional detection methods are based on static analysis with signature matching and dynamic analysis methods that are focused on sensitive behaviors. However, the usual detections have only limited effect when meeting the development of malware, so that the manual update for feature sets is essential. Besides, most of these methods match target samples with the usual feature database, which ignored the characteristics of the sample itself. In this paper, we propose a new malware detection method that could combine the features of a single sample and the general features of malware. Firstly, a structure of Directed Cyclic Graph (DCG) is adopted to extract features from samples. Then the sensitivity of each API call is computed with Markov Chain. Afterward, the graph is merged with the chain to get the final features. Finally, the detectors based on machine learning or deep learning are devised for identification. To evaluate the effect and robustness of our approach, several experiments were adopted. The results showed that the proposed method had a good performance in most tests, and the approach also had stability with the development and growth of malware."

Improved Deep Residual Network for Apple Leaf Disease Identification,2021,"['Agricultural Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Vision', 'Deep Learning']",,"Plant disease is one of the most irritating problems for agriculture growers. Thus, timely detection of plant diseases is of high importance to practical value, and corresponding measures can be taken at the early stage of plant diseases. Therefore, numerous researchers have made unremitting efforts in plant disease identification.

Fault Detection Based on a Combined Approach of FA-CP-ELM with Application to Wind Turbine System,2021,"['Wind turbine', 'Firefly algorithm', 'Chaos map', 'Extreme learning machine', 'Faults detection', 'Partial least squares']",,"In this paper, a novel wind turbine (WT) fault detection method, based on the Partial Least Squares (PLS), Firefly Algorithm (FA), Chaos Map (CP) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which is proposed and explained in detail. The proposed method includes two procedures: a WT mathematical model with PLS and a prediction model with FA-CP-ELM. Since the WT system is modeled as a system using PLS, the ELM has been optimized by the FA and CP to improve the predictive performance.

First, the feature normalization method is used to smooth the feature data to eliminate the influence of too large or too small feature values on the model's classification performance. Secondly, the oversampling method is used to expand and sample the data, which solves the unbalanced classification of labelled samples. Finally, the Tri-training algorithm performs machine learning on the training samples and establishes a defect prediction model. The novelty of this model is that it can effectively combine feature normalization, oversampling techniques, and the Tri-training algorithm to solve both the under-labelled sample and class imbalance problems.

KSURE(Korea Trade Insurance Corporation) is a major public institution for financial policy in Korea, and thus the company is strongly committed to backing export companies with various systems. Nevertheless, there are still fewer cases of realized business model based on big-data analyses.  In this situation, this paper aims to develop a new business model which can be applied to an ex-ante prediction for the likelihood of the insurance accident of credit guarantee. We utilize internal data from KSURE which supports export companies in Korea and apply machine learning models. Then, we conduct performance comparison among the predictive models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN(Deep Neural Network).  For decades, many researchers have tried to find better models which can help to predict bankruptcy since the ex-ante prediction is crucial for corporate managers, investors, creditors, and other stakeholders. The development of the prediction for financial distress or bankruptcy was originated from Smith(1930), Fitzpatrick(1932), or Merwin(1942). One of the most famous models is the Altmans Z-score model(Altman, 1968) which was based on the multiple discriminant analysis. This model is widely used in both research and practice by this time. The author suggests the score model that utilizes five key financial ratios to predict the probability of bankruptcy in the next two years. Ohlson(1980) introduces logit model to complement some limitations of previous models. Furthermore, Elmer and Borowski(1988) develop and examine a rule-based, automated system which conducts the financial analysis of savings and loans.  Since the 1980s, researchers in Korea have started to examine analyses on the prediction of financial distress or bankruptcy. Kim(1987) analyzes financial ratios and develops the prediction model. Also, Han et al.(1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2005, 2006) construct the prediction model using various techniques including artificial neural network. Yang(1996) introduces multiple discriminant analysis and logit model. Besides, Kim and Kim(2001) utilize artificial neural network techniques for ex-ante prediction of insolvent enterprises. After that, many scholars have been trying to predict financial distress or bankruptcy more precisely based on diverse models such as Random Forest or SVM. One major distinction of our research from the previous research is that we focus on examining the predicted probability of default for each sample case, not only on investigating the classification accuracy of each model for the entire sample.  Most predictive models in this paper show that the level of the accuracy of classification is about 70% based on the entire sample. To be specific, LightGBM model shows the highest accuracy of 71.1% and Logit model indicates the lowest accuracy of 69%. However, we confirm that there are open to multiple interpretations. In the context of the business, we have to put more emphasis on efforts to minimize type 2 error which causes more harmful operating losses for the guaranty company. Thus, we also compare the classification accuracy by splitting predicted probability of the default into ten equal intervals.  When we examine the classification accuracy for each interval, Logit model has the highest accuracy of 100% for 0~10% of the predicted probability of the default, however, Logit model has a relatively lower accuracy of 61.5% for 90~100% of the predicted probability of the default. On the other hand, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN indicate more desirable results since they indicate a higher level of accuracy for both 0~10% and 90~100% of the predicted probability of the default but have a lower level of accur"

As acupoint selection is specific to target diseases, each acupoint is generally believed to have a specific indication. However, the specificity of acupoint selection may be not always same with the specificity of acupoint indication. In this review, we propose that the specificity of acupoint indication can be inferred from clinical data using reverse inference. Using forward inference, the prescribed acupoints for each disease can be quantified for the specificity of acupoint selection. Using reverse inference, targeted diseases for each acupoint can be quantified for the specificity of acupoint indication. It is noteworthy that the selection of an acupoint for a particular disease does not imply the acupoint has specific indications for that disease. Electronic medical record includes various symptoms and chosen acupoint combinations. Data mining approach can be useful to reveal the complex relationships between diseases and acupoints from clinical data. Combining the clinical information and the bodily sensation map, the spatial patterns of acupoint indication can be further estimated. Interoperable medical data should be collected for medical knowledge discovery and clinical decision support system. In the era of artificial intelligence, machine learning can reveal the associations between diseases and prescribed acupoints from large scale clinical data warehouse."

Furthermore, its importance has increased significantly with the advent of smart grid. Variables affecting building energy consumption include identified various environmental conditions that cast sophisticated effect on the energy performance of the buildings. However, due to a large number of potentially associated environmental variables, it is needed to extract embedded features so as to improve building energy prediction capability through adopting Principle Component Analysis which could reduce input data dimension. The primary objective of this study is to propose a high-precision building energy demand prediction model by reducing the dimensionality through PCA. Machine learning is implemented by using LSTM model, and prediction accuracy and performance are verified through R², RMSE, MAE, as well as computation time. The improvement ratio showed 14.93% increase when dimension-reduced dataset and normalized raw data were combined in comparison with the predicted case tested by using only normalized raw data. This study could support optimum building energy operation planning and design by promoting the creation and implementation of energy-efficient smart grid systems in the future."

Although many studies tend to increase the amount of data used in the pretraining stage, it is hard to say that the amount of data must be increased to improve machine translation performance. In this study, through an experiment based on the mBART model using parallel corpus filtering, we propose that high quality data can yield better machine translation performance, even utilizing smaller amount of data. We propose that it is important to consider the quality of data rather than the amount of data, and it can be used as a guideline for building a training corpus."

The reason for using these data is that the descriptive lecture evaluation contains various students opinions, so useful information can be derived for future class improvement plans. The existing method for deriving useful information using lecture evaluation text data was only to perform simple aggregation by classifying the contents into several related categories. Unlike existing methods, this study intends to derive useful information by using text mining among data mining techniques. To this end, first, the machine learning method was applied to predictively classify whether the lecture evaluation text material was positive or negative. Second, for specific analysis, k-means cluster analysis, topic analysis, sentiment analysis, and naive Bayes method were applied. The unsupervised learning technique used the entire dataset, and the naive Bayes method, a supervised learning technique, used a validation data set (70%) to find the optimal model, and tested the optimal model with the validation data set (30%) and analyzed. As a result of the analysis, the naive Bayes method showed a correct classification rate of 84%, showing superior performance compared to the topic analysis (68%) and sentiment analysis (75%) methods, and was confirmed as the most appropriate model among the methods considered."

Until now, representative node embedding techniques have been studied for homogeneous graphs, and thus it is difficult to learn knowledge graphs with unique meanings for each edge. To resolve this problem, the conventional Triple2Vec technique builds an embedding model by learning a triple graph having a node pair and an edge of the knowledge graph as one node. However, the Triple2 Vec embedding model has limitations in improving performance because it calculates the relationship between triple nodes as a simple measure. Therefore, this paper proposes a feature extraction technique based on a graph convolutional neural network to improve the Triple2Vec embedding model. The proposed method extracts the neighborliness vector of the triple graph and learns the relationship between neighboring nodes for each node in the triple graph. We proves that the embedding model applying the proposed method is superior to the existing Triple2Vec model through category classification experiments using DBLP, DBpedia, and IMDB datasets."

We analyzed the relationships between the thermal comfort responses, physiological factors, and thermal environment to develop an accurate thermal comfort prediction model. While the skin temperature and electrodermal activity exhibited a significant relationship with the thermal state, a low heart rate was observed in a more comfortable state. Moreover, machine learning classifiers predicted the thermal comfort state achieved an accuracy of 80% in both seasons using only physiological data. Thus, the feature importance of the random forest classifier verified that physiological factors aid the prediction of thermal states significantly.

Through this, the flexibility and elasticity to automatically register the data of the collection target are secured, and real-time network quality monitoring is possible. In addition, a large amount of traffic data collected from the system was analyzed by machine learning (AI) to predict future traffic of OTT operators. Through this, more scientific and systematic prediction was possible, and in addition, it was possible to optimize the interworking between ISP operators and to secure the quality of large-scale OTT services."

First of all, Risk criminal law focuses on preemptive measures to future potential risks. However, it will eventually lead to the functionalization or policyization of criminal law. On the other hand, the allowed risk theory makes it possible to take some risks arising in modern industrial societies. In the case of autonomous driving vehicles, the problem is to what extent can our society allow risks from errors in autonomous driving vehicles’ software?Although the 「Act on Promotion and Support of Commercialization of autonomous driving vehicles」 is enacted and implemented in 2019, it focuses on the development of autonomous vehicle technology and the establishment of infrastructure, and there are no regulations on the risks.Therefore, it is necessary to establish the permissible range of autonomous driving vehicle risks to ensure the safety of the people and to establish a legal basis for the preliminary regulation and management of risks exceeding them. ‘Mean Distance Between Failures(MDBF)’ can be used as a quantified basis for determining the safety of autonomous driving vehicles.

민사소송상 인공지능 법관에 관한 소고,2021,"['민사소송', '인공지능', '법관', '기계학습', '기술역량', 'Civil Procedure', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Judge', 'Machine Learning', 'technological competence']","최근 법률분야에서 인공지능을 활용하는 것을 넘어 인공지능이 법관을 대체할 수 있는지에 대한 논의가 이루어지고 있다. 주어진 현실만을 놓고 판단했을 때, 현재 법률분야에서 활용되고 있는 인공지능 기술은 법관을 대체할 수 있는 수준에 이르지 못한 것으로 보인다. 그럼에도 불구하고 이에 관한 논의가 이루어지는 까닭은 기계학습의 발전과 빅데이터 활용에 따라 실현가능성에 대한 기대가 증가하였고, 업무효율성 강화, 재판불신 극복, 법관 수 부족 해결 등 인공지능 법관의 필요성을 인정할 수 있기 때문이다. 이처럼 인공지능의 필요성이 인정될 수 있다면 현재의 기술로 그 구현이 어렵더라도 현 제도 하에서 그 실현이 가능한지 그리고 현재 필요한 노력은 무엇인지 등에 대해 고민해 볼 가치가 있을 것이다. 인공지능 법관의 필요성이 인정되고, 기술적 실현가능성이 기대된다고 하더라도 현재의 기술 수준에서는 한계가 비교적 명확해 보인다. 첫째, 인공지능 법관에 의한 판결은 일관성은 유지되겠지만, 공정한 재판보다 획일적인 재판이 될 가능성이 더 높다. 둘째, 인공지능 법관은 인간의 다양한 가치관을 제대로 반영하기 어렵고, 잘못된 사회통념이 반영 및 발현될 가능성이 있다. 셋째, 인공지능 법관은 심리원칙에 따른 사실관계 확정을 적절히 수행해 내기 어렵다. 또한 인공지능은 기대의 대상이면서 불신의 대상이기도 하다는 점에서 충분한 신뢰를 얻지 못한 상태이다. 따라서 현 시점에서 인공지능 법관의 전격적 도입은 어렵다. 하지만 향후 인공지능 기술의 보편화로 인공지능 법관의 기술적 실현이 가능하고 국민의 신뢰까지 얻게 된다면, 어떤 제도적 변화가 수반되어야 하는지에 대해서 고민해 볼 여지가 있다. 첫째, 인공지능 법관으로의 전면 대체는 바람직한 방향이 아니며 다수의 지지를 받기도 어렵다. 즉 인공지능 법관을 도입한다고 하더라도, 일부를 수용하는 형태로 추진될 수 있을 뿐이다. 둘째, 인공지능 역시 판단에 오류가 있을 가능성이 있으므로, 인공지능 법관에 의한 재판의 공정성을 확보하기 위해 상소가 가능해야 한다. 셋째, 인공지능 법관은 사실심을 담당하는 것이 합리적이며, 그 중에서도 제1심만 담당하도록 하는 것이 합리적이다. 넷째, 인공지능 법관을 도입하여 활용할 수 있는 시범사업 대상으로는 소액사건이 합리적이다. 다만 소액사건 중에서 다시 금액과 유형에 따른 제한을 하고, 선택적 요소를 도입할 필요가 있다. 현재의 기술 수준에서 인공지능이 모든 재판업무에 있어 법관의 역할을 온전히 수행하기를 기대하는 것은 적절치 않다. 하지만 인공지능 법관의 가능성 유무에 대해 막연히 부정적으로 평가하거나 비판하기보다 사용가능한 기술을 어떻게 적절히 활용할 수 있을 것인지를 고민하고 이를 실제에 적용해 보는 것이 합리적인 접근법이라 생각한다. 이를 통해 실질적인 가능성을 확인할 수 있고 변화의 기반을 마련할 수 있다. 이에 재판업무에 인공지능을 활용하는 것에 중점을 두고, 인공지능 법관 역시 부수적으로 함께 시범사업으로 진행해 보는 것이 합리적인 선택이라 생각한다. 또한 인공지능의 바람직한 활용을 위해서는 체계적이고 주기적인 교육이 수반되어야 하고, 법조인에게 기술역량 구비가 요구되어야 할 것이다.","Recently, in the legal field, discussions have been made on whether AI can replace judges beyond the use of AI. Judging by only the given reality, it seems that the AI technology currently used in the legal field has not reached the level that can replace judges. Nevertheless, the discussion is ongoing for the following reasons. First, with the development of machine learning and the use of big data, expectations for feasibility have increased. Second, the need for AI judges is recognized by enhancing work efficiency, overcoming trial mistrust, and solving the lack of number of judges. If the necessity of an AI judge can be acknowledged, it will be worth considering whether it can be realized under the current system and what efforts are currently needed, even if it is difficult to implement it with the current technology. Even if the need for an AI judge is recognized and technical feasibility is expected, the limitations seem relatively clear at the current technology level. First, the judgment by an AI judge will remain consistent, but it is more likely to be a uniform trial than a fair trial. Second, it is difficult for AI judges to properly reflect various human values, and there is a possibility that false social norms may be reflected and expressed. Third, it is difficult for AI judges to properly determine the facts according to the trial principles. In addition, AI has not gained sufficient trust in that it is both an expected object and an object of distrust. Therefore, it is difficult to fully introduce an AI judge at this time. However, if AI technology becomes common in the future, it becomes technically feasible for AI judges, and AI gains the public s trust, there is room to consider what institutional changes should be accompanied. First, the full substitution of AI judges is not a desirable direction, and it is difficult to receive a large number of support. In other words, even if an AI judge is introduced, it can only be promoted in the form of accommodating some. Second, since there is a possibility that there is an error in the judgment of AI as well, an appeal should be possible in order to secure the fairness of the trial by an AI judge. Third, it is rational for AI judges to be in charge of factual trials, and among them, it is reasonable to have only the first trial. Fourth, as a pilot project that can introduce and utilize AI judges, a small amount case is reasonable. However, it is necessary to re-limit according to the amount and type, and to introduce an optional element among small claims cases. At the current level of technology, it is not appropriate to expect AI to fully perform the role of judges in all judicial affairs. However, rather than vaguely negatively evaluating or criticizing the possibility of AI judges, I think it is a reasonable approach to consider how to properly use the available technologies and apply them in practice. Through this, practical possibilities can be identified and a basis for change can be laid. Therefore, I think that it is a reasonable option to focus on the use of AI in the judicial affairs, and to proceed as a pilot project with AI judges. In addition, systematic and periodic education should be accompanied in order to utilize AI, and legal professionals should be equipped with technological competence."

By doing this, this study tries to analyze underlying linguistic views in every methods. We first described an acoustic model and a language model in the speech recognition model. A speech chain of human communication was also described to find common ground with the speech recognition model. Then, using the phonetic weakening variant of modern Chinese function word “ge”, a rule-based generative phonological framework has been adapted based on rationalistic views. The view of the first-generation artificial intelligence was also discussed in this regard. Furthermore, the constraint weights for the phonetic weakening variant of “ge” were obtained based on the Harmonic grammar and the Maximum entropy model. These modeling were in relation to machine learning of second-generation artificial intelligence based on an empirical perspective. To conclude, it was revealed that knowledge of human speech is probabilistic. Furthermore, due to a great deal of big data training, mutual AI is expected to be able to learn about the universal grammar of human language, but it was pointed out that the limits are still clear in terms of functionalism and pragmatics."

In intelligent unmanned processing systems, data are collected in real time using sensors. The equipment is controlled by predicting future situations using the collected data. Particularly, a technology for the prediction of tool wear and for determining the exact timing of tool replacement is needed to prevent defected or unprocessed products due to tool breakage or tool wear. Directly measuring the tool wear in real time is difficult during the cutting process in milling. Therefore, tool wear should be predicted indirectly by analyzing the cutting load of the main spindle, current, vibration, noise, etc. In this study, data from the current and acceleration sensors; displacement data along the X, Y, and Z axes; tool wear value, and shape change data observed using Newroview were collected from the high-speed, two-edge, flat-end mill machining process of SKD11 steel. The support vector machine technique (machine learning technique) was applied to predict the amount of tool wear using the aforementioned data. Additionally, the prediction accuracies of all kernels were compared."

After collecting weekday comments on those media for five consecutive months, the study has employed three text analysis methods: word frequency, Glove word embedding and Support Vector Machine(SVM). Particularly, machine learning text classification method SVM is used in order to examine whether comments on each news outlet can be classified into the comments from their news outlet origins. As a result, the study has found three findings. First, two foci of the comments ecology is found. One is MBC and the other is one of conservative creators media called Fun & Mic. Second, SBS and two cable news channels such as JTBC and Channel A were ideological in the middle position between them. Third, it is found that the commentaries are usually dealt with the same issue across examined channels and supporting messages from audiences are often found. However, the subject for supporting was different. For example, the comment message on MBC has shown the support to media outlet, whereas the message on Fun & Mic contains the support to the owner of the channels and Attorney General who seemed to oppose against the governing party. Overall, the study has shown that the comments opinions are divided into two poplars of news media channels. In the future, YouTube creators from liberal-progressive can be added for additional support in order to draw the completed picture with a bird eye view of comments ecology."

Unlike stocks and bonds, the price of artworks has a heterogeneous characteristic that is determined by reflecting both objective and subjective factors, so the uncertainty in price prediction is high. In this study, we used LSTM Recurrent Neural Network deep learning model to predict the auction winning price by inputting the artist, physical and sales charateristics of the Korean artist. According to the result, the RMSE value, which explains the difference between the predicted and actual price by model, was 0.064. Painter Lee Dae Won had the highest predictive power, and Lee Joong Seop had the lowest. The results suggest the art market becomes more active as investment goods and demand for auction winning price increases."

The IT industry has been building up massive repositories of image data to be used for machine learning and computer vision. Although the term computer “vision” suggests it assimilates human vision, they differ fundamentally because computer vision is an algorithmic process. While the collection of image datasets is crucial for enhancement of AI’s creative capability, the risk of uncontrolled mass collection of image data and their prejudicial or discriminatory use for machine learning has become highly problematic. Often in AI art, images are artificially generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) that are trained with images of historic artworks. As computer vision differs from human vision, AI-generated artistic images cannot be evaluated using conventional criteria. The formulation of new criteria would be essential if the new AI art were to be accepted into the creative art at large."

Lightweight CNN based Meter Digit Recognition,2021,"['Automatic meter reading', 'Lightweight Deep Neural Network', 'Image processing', 'Convolutional neural network']",,"Image processing is one of the major techniques that are used for computer vision. Nowadays, researchers are using machine learning and deep learning for the aforementioned task. In recent years, digit recognition tasks, i.e., automatic meter recognition approach using electric or water meters, have been studied several times. However, two major issues arise when we talk about previous studies: first, the use of the deep learning technique, which includes a large number of parameters that increase the computational cost and consume more power; and second, recent studies are limited to the detection of digits and not storing or providing detected digits to a database or mobile applications. This paper proposes a system that can detect the digital number of meter readings using a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) for low power consumption and send those digits to an Android mobile application in real-time to store them and make life easy. The proposed lightweight DNN is computationally inexpensive and exhibits accuracy similar to those of conventional DNNs."

Artificial intelligence-related inventions can be classified into inventions characterized by the implementation of artificial intelligence, inventions characterized by the application field of artificial intelligence technology, and inventions created by artificial intelligence. For inventions related to the realization of artificial intelligence itself and inventions related to the application of artificial intelligence, it is possible to apply the criteria for judging the patent eligibility of computer programs and inventions related to business methods. In the case of “invention created” by AI, it is difficult to see it as an invention when the product of AI is data or image. In the case where an artificial intelligence product is automatically generated by inputting new data to a learning model created based on the learning data, the issue will be whether it can be recognized as a “creation” of technical ideas. It is, however, difficult to admit that such creativity was exerted by artificial intelligence. With regard to the identification of the inventors for the 'inventions created' by AI, there is a question of which person (thing) should be specified as an inventor. These issues are also related to the question of whether AI is qualified to become an inventor. With regard to the question of whether a legal personality as an inventor (applicant, patentee) can granted to AI, it is not plausible for the time being to give a legal personality similar to a natural person, in light of the technical characteristics and nature of artificial intelligence currently realized. However, if strong AI (or AGI) emerges in the future, there will be more room to recognize the subject-matter patentability of the inventions created by AI along with granting legal personality to AI."

A variety of templates in the railway vehicle system domain are fed into the input of unsupervised machine learning algorithms as training instances. The clustering models in an unsupervised way classify the templates into a several clusters.

The system we have developed makes a new sentence of specification belonged into one of groups, and then, if it finds the identical template in a specific cluster, it confirms the new specification as a sound one. Otherwise, it autonomically returns the most similar template recommended by k-means clustering algorithm. We have tested our system to verify both cases.

In order to improve the classification accuracy for term deposit subscriptions, many studies have been conducted based on machine learning techniques. However, even if these models can achieve satisfactory performance, utilizing them is not an easy task in the industry when their decision-making process is not adequately explained. To address this issue, this paper proposes an explainable scheme for term deposit subscription forecasting. For this, we first construct several classification models using decision tree-based ensemble learning methods, which yield excellent performance in tabular data, such as random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). We then analyze their classification performance in depth through 10-fold cross-validation. After that, we provide the rationale for interpreting the influence of customer information and the decision-making process by applying Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), an explainable artificial intelligence technique, to the best classification model. To verify the practicality and validity of our scheme, experiments were conducted with the bank marketing dataset provided by Kaggle; we applied the SHAP to the GBM and LightGBM models, respectively, according to different dataset configurations and then performed their analysis and visualization for explainable term deposit subscriptions."

In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been successfully shown to obtain high accuracy of stock price direction. Although there are numerous research studies being conducted regarding the direction of stock price movement, there are relatively few studies on labeling of data for learning algorithms. The problem with incorrectly labeled data sets in intelligent systems based on machine learning is that learner then trains the incorrect identification and knowledge, which will make it harder for trained learners to predict the correct results. Therefore, incorrect labeling methods could cause information loss and may act as a cause of poor prediction performance when implementing a prediction model. To solve this problem, this study proposes an N-period volatility labeling that is based on the volatility of n-period look back window, which is more dynamic. In order to identify the usefulness of the proposed model, this study is compared against the conventional approach. An empirical study of the proposed model is simulated in the Nasdaq stock market."

However, there is a physical limit to continuously hiring a DSt suitable for each company s important business area/activity from outside and it is undesirable for companies that expect to establish a data-based scientific decision-making culture. This is because the correct decision-making of a company is possible based on an understanding of the business environment with experience and knowledge in related fields.

The car-ferry has a navigation pattern that passes through 2 to 4 islands. Safety inspections at the departure point(home port) are carried out by the crew, the operation supervisor of the operation management office, and the maritime safety supervisor. In some cases, self-inspections are carried out for safety inspections at layovers. As with any system, there are institutional and practical limitations. To this end, this study was conducted to suggest a method of detecting a vehicle using image processing and linking it to the calculations for ship stability. For vehicle detection, a method using a difference image and one using machine learning were used. However, a limitation was observed in these methods that the vehicle could not be identified due to strong background lighting from the pier and the ship in the cases where the camera was backlit such as during sunset or at night. It appears necessary to secure sufficient image data and upgrade the program for stable image processing."
베이지안 최적화를 통한 저서성 대형무척추동물 종분포모델 개발,2021,,,"This study explored the usefulness and implications of the Bayesian hyperparameter optimization in developing species distribution models (SDMs). A variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosted regression tree (BRT), XGBoost (XGB), and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) were used for predicting the occurrence of four benthic macroinvertebrate species. The Bayesian optimization method successfully tuned model hyperparameters, with all ML models resulting an area under the curve (AUC) > 0.7. Also, hyperparameter search ranges that generally clustered around the optimal values suggest the efficiency of the Bayesian optimization in finding optimal sets of hyperparameters. Tree based ensemble algorithms (BRT, RF, and XGB) tended to show higher performances than SVM and MLP. Important hyperparameters and optimal values differed by species and ML model, indicating the necessity of hyperparameter tuning for improving individual model performances. The optimization results demonstrate that for all macroinvertebrate species SVM and RF required fewer numbers of trials until obtaining optimal hyperparameter sets, leading to reduced computational cost compared to other ML algorithms. The results of this study suggest that the Bayesian optimization is an efficient method for hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms."

Several machine learning classifi ers, such as Linear DiscriminantAnalysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Naïve Bayes, and Gaussian Process Classifi er (GPC), have classifi edthe data based on the cross-validation approach. A GP classifi er was implemented using three kernels, namely radial basis,linear, and polynomial kernel, considering the ability to handle the non-linear data. The classifi er performance was evaluatedand compared using performance metrics such as accuracy(AC), sensitivity(SN), specifi city(SP), precision(PR), F1 score,and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve(AUC). Initially, all non-linear HRV features were selected forclassifi cation, but the specifi city of the model was the limitation. Thus, only two Poincare plot features were used to designthe diagnostic model. Our diagnostic model shows the performance using GPC based linear kernel as AC of 92.59%, SNof 96.07%, SP of 81.81%, PR of 94.23%, F1 score of 0.95, and AUC of 0.89, which are more extensive compared to otherclassifi cation models. Further, the diagnostic model was deployed on the hardware module. Its performance on unknown/testdata was validated on 65 subjects (healthy n = 15 and T2DM n = 50). Considering the desirable performance of the diagnosticmodel, it can be used as an initial screening test tool for a healthcare practitioner to predict T2DM risk."

고차원 관측자료에서의 Q-학습 모형에 대한 이중강건성 연구,2021,['Q-'],,"Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are decision-making rules designed to provide personalized treatment to individuals in multi-stage randomized trials. Unlike classical methods, in which all individuals are prescribed the same type of treatment, DTRs prescribe patient-tailored treatments which take into account individual characteristics that may change over time. The Q-learning method, one of regression-based algorithms to figure out optimal treatment rules, becomes more popular as it can be easily implemented. However, the performance of the Q-learning algorithm heavily relies on the correct specification of the Q-function for response, especially in observational studies. In this article, we examine a number of double-robust weighted least-squares estimating methods for Q-learning in high-dimensional settings, where treatment models for propensity score and penalization for sparse estimation are also investigated. We further consider flexible ensemble machine learning methods for the treatment model to achieve double-robustness, so that optimal decision rule can be correctly estimated as long as at least one of the outcome model or treatment model is correct. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed methods work well with practical sample sizes. The practical utility of the proposed methods is proven with real data example."

Use Python to analyze web scraping, keyword frequency analysis, and machine learning algorithms. A total of 267 sentences from 17 media and 82 articles were analyzed. According to the research, a total of 64 words were found in the Hanwha club’s position as “Corona,” followed by “19” (58 times), “Shin Jeong-rak” (46 times), “player” (42 times), and “team” (42 times). For the Daejeon team, “Players” (67 times) appeared the most, followed by “A” (33 times), “Judging” (26 times), “Exam” (23 times), and “Corona” (22 times). Through this case analysis study, it was found that the Daejeon team, which did not disclose the player’s real name to the media, responded more effectively than the Hanwha team where the real name of the player was mentioned. From Hanwha’s case, it was possible to infer that the club’s defensive strategy to reduce its responsibility, especially its excuse strategy, could be an ineffective strategic choice that could provoke public anger. In fact, even though Shin Jung-rak first showed symptoms of fever in the serious stage of COVID-19, the Hanwha team focused on making excuses in a crisis with a high level of responsibility, such as reporting it to the KBO, but only during the crisis, 4,447 “Angry” emoji was recorded. Focusing on the team’s efforts and investigation process in the situation of confirmed cases, the strategic pattern of explaining selected information about COVID-19 such as “confirmed decision process,” “inspection process” and “contact information” could be inferred as an effective response to the use of professional sports teams."

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors. This study aims to identify predictors of treatment responses in patients affected by early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligo-metastases treated with SBRT and to develop an accurate machine learning model to predict radiological response to SBRT.Materials and Methods: Computed tomography (CT) images of 85 tumors (stage I–II NSCLC and pulmonary oligo-metastases) from 69 patients treated with SBRT were analyzed. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were contoured on CT images. Patients that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were defined as responders. One hundred ten radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics module based on the GTV. The association of features with response to SBRT was evaluated. A model using support vector machine (SVM) was then trained to predict response based solely on the extracted radiomics features. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate model performance of the identified radiomic predictors.Results: Sixty-nine patients receiving thoracic SBRT from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Skewness and root mean squared were identified as radiomic predictors of response to SBRT. The SVM machine learning model developed had an accuracy of 74.8%. The area under curves for CR, PR, and non-responder prediction were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794–0.921), 0.946 (95% CI, 0.873–0.978), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.789–0.915), respectively.Conclusion: Radiomic analysis of pre-treatment CT scan is a promising tool that can predict tumor response to SBRT."

After performing data preprocessing using the programming language R, we measured cosine similarity between chapters within a novel and cosine similarity between chapters of different novels to classify the novels. We found the cosine similarity between chapters within the novel is relatively high, but not between the novels. Furthermore, clustering analysis, which is an unsupervised machine learning task, showed strong cohesion of semantic distance, and classification analysis, which is a supervised machine learning task, showed high accuracy. In addition, we have confirmed that children's novels can be classified as easy-to-read works due to the large cosine similarity value and small semantic distance between chapters. Therefore, quantitative text analysis using text mining technique is expected to serve as a foundation for performing qualitative text analysis."

Wi-Fi access points (APs) built in many construction in advance helps developing a Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based indoor localization. This localization method first collects pairs of position and RSSI measurement set, which is called fingerprint database, and then estimates a user’s position when given a query measurement set by comparing the fingerprint database. The challenge arises from nonlinearity and noise on Wi-Fi RSSI measurements and complexity of handling a large amount of the fingerprint data. In this paper, machine learning techniques have been applied to implement Wi-Fi based localization. However, most of existing indoor localizations focus on single position estimation. The main contribution of this paper is to develop multi-target localization by using deep neural, which is beneficial when a massive crowd requests positioning service.

Although the necessity and importance of modeling analysis is increasing, there has been lack of academic discussions on how to approach the visualization of its process. Therefore, in this study, we examine the visualization approach for each process through the analysis of preceding studies that visualize the execution process of artificial intelligence. Methods:  In this study, machine learning and deep learning pipelines in general predictive modeling projects were examined and the papers applied to them were examined, and the process of performing artificial intelligence was divided into three stages (Collection, Learning, Inference). In addition, we analyzed how visualization is performed at each stage based on the research framework.Results:  The processes of artificial intelligence are categorized as ① Collection process (visualization of data collection status) ② Learning process(preprocessing, characteristic extraction and selection) ③ Inference(valuation of accuracy and significance of algorithm). As a result of examining visualization method of each procedural step, we found that there is difference in providing data visualization method depending on the research purpose (understanding model operation/identifying the cause of misclassification, debugging support, etc.) and subject(expert/non-expert).Conclusions:  The items derived from this study will be used as basic data for analyzing data visualization design cases according to the execution process of artificial intelligence in the future. Based on this study, if case analysis from more diverse perspectives is conducted in the future, it is expected that strategy establishment and theoretical foundation to visualize the execution process of artificial intelligence will be possible."

Spectrum sensing is a key technology in cognitive radio communication, which enhances spectral efficiency. Recently, signals  transmitted and received by wireless communication systems have been based on OFDM. These signals contain a pilot signal for channel calibration, which can be detected using a spectral correlation function (SCF). In this process, the FAM algorithm is applied for efficient SCF operation herein. The existence of OFDM signals is determined through a convolutional neural network-based ML algorithm using the SCF as input data. The learning data for ML use the SCF values for OFDM signals with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of -20 to 0 dB. Consequently, on evaluation of the post-learning optimized neural network performance, signals were detected with a probability of 0.9 at the condition of 0.08 false alarm probability for reception signals with SNRs of -12 dB."

기계학습을 위한 색 추적 기반 데이터셋 구축 자동화 기법,2021,"['딥러닝', '데이터셋', '훈련 도구', '꽃 이미지', 'deeplearning', 'data set', 'training tool', 'flower image']","기계학습을 통한 문제 해결을 위한 단계에서 가장 중요한 부분 중의 하나가 데이터셋을 구축하는 것이다. 기존의 데 이터셋 구축 방법은 트레이닝 과정에서 소량의 이미지에 변화를 주어 데이터를 부풀리는 명령어를 사용하는 것과 ‘google 이미지 검색’에서 이미지 크롤링을 사용하는 것이 대부분이다. 하지만 이러한 방법들은 데이터로서 이미지 의 신뢰성이 보장되어 있지 않는 경우가 자주 발생한다. 기계학습 중 딥러닝 트레이닝을 위해서는 신뢰성이 보장된 데이터셋이 구축되어야 한다. 이에 따라 본 연구에서는 신뢰성을 보장받을 수 있는 데이터셋을 구축하기 위한 도구 를 설계 및 구현한다. 적은 노력으로 큰 데이터셋을 구축할 수 있는 방안을 고려하고, 그 방안을 통해 구축된 데이터 셋의 신뢰성을 테스트한다. 신뢰성을 보증하기 위한 예시로 꽃 이미지 데이터셋을 구축하여 ‘이미지 검색 꽃 사전’에 적용한다. 적용 결과로, 사용자는 딥러닝 트레이닝 과정에서 필요한 데이터셋을 보다 쉽고 경제적으로 구축할 수 있 고, 구축된 데이터셋을 통한 트레이닝에서의 신뢰성과 효율성이 있음을 보인다. 또한 본 연구의 아이디어를 기본으 로 활용한다면, 데이터셋을 구축하고자 하는 대상의 특성이 변하더라도 대량의 이미지 데이터셋을 생산할 수 있을 것이다.","One of the most important steps for solving problems through machine learning is to build a data set. Most previous methods of the data set generation are using commands to inflate data by changing small amounts of images during training, and image crawling in Google Image Search. However, these methods often do not guarantee the reliability of the image as data. For deeplearning training among methods of machine learning, a reliable data set must be established. Accordingly, in this study, a novel tool is designed and implemented to build a data set that can ensure reliability. We propose ways to build large data sets with little effort, and test the reliability of data sets built through them. As an example to ensure reliability, a set of flower image data is established and applied to ‘image search flower dictionary’. As a result, users can more easily and cost-effectively build the data sets needed in the deep-learning training process, and ensure reliability and efficiency in training through the generated data set. In addition, the underlying use of the ideas proposed in this study will enable the production of large sets of image data, even if the characteristics of the target to build the data set will be changed."
Node2vec 그래프 임베딩과 Light GBM 링크 예측을 활용한 식음료 산업의 수출 후보국가 탐색 연구,2021,"['그래프 임베딩', '링크예측', '글로벌 가치사슬', 'Node2vec', 'Graph Embedding', 'Light GBM', 'Link Prediction', 'Global Value Chain']",,"This study uses Node2vec graph embedding method and Light GBM link prediction to explore undeveloped export candidate countries in Koreas food and beverage industry. Node2vec is the method that improves the limit of the structural equivalence representation of the network, which is known to be relatively weak compared to the existing link prediction method based on the number of common neighbors of the network. Therefore, the method is known to show excellent performance in both community detection and structural equivalence of the network. The vector value obtained by embedding the network in this way operates under the condition of a constant length from an arbitrarily designated starting point node. Therefore, it has the advantage that it is easy to apply the sequence of nodes as an input value to the model for downstream tasks such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Based on these features of the Node2vec graph embedding method, this study applied the above method to the international trade information of the Korean food and beverage industry. Through this, we intend to contribute to creating the effect of extensive margin diversification in Korea in the global value chain relationship of the industry. The optimal predictive model derived from the results of this study recorded a precision of 0.95 and a recall of 0.79, and an F1 score of 0.86, showing excellent performance. This performance was shown to be superior to that of the binary classifier based on Logistic Regression set as the baseline model. In the baseline model, a precision of 0.95 and a recall of 0.73 were recorded, and an F1 score of 0.83 was recorded. In addition, the light GBM-based optimal prediction model derived from this study showed superior performance than the link prediction model of previous studies, which is set as a benchmarking model in this study. The predictive model of the previous study recorded only a recall rate of 0.75, but the proposed model of this study showed better performance which recall rate is 0.79. The difference in the performance of the prediction results between benchmarking model and this study model is due to the model learning strategy. In this study, groups were classified by the trade value scale, and prediction models were trained differently for these groups. Specific methods are (1) a method of randomly masking and learning a model for all trades without setting specific conditions for trade value, (2) arbitrarily masking a part of the trades with an average trade value or higher and using the model method, and (3) a method of arbitrarily masking some of the trades with the top 25% or higher trade value and learning the model. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the performance of the model trained by randomly masking some of the trades with the above-average trade value in this method was the best and appeared stably. It was found that most of the results of potential export candidates for Korea derived through the above model appeared appropriate through additional investigation. Combining the above, this study could suggest the practical utility of the link prediction method applying Node2vec and Light GBM. In addition, useful implications could be derived for weight update strategies that can perform better link prediction while training the model. On the other hand, this study also has policy utility because it is applied to trade transactions that have not been performed much in the research related to link prediction based on graph embedding. The results of this study support a rapid response to changes in the global value chain such as the recent US-China trade conflict or Japans export regulations, and I think that it has sufficient usefulness as a tool for policy decision-making."
Generating 3D texture models of vessel pipes using 2D texture transferred by object recognition,2021,"['augmented reality', 'CycleGAN', 'ResNet', 'normalization', 'texture', '3D model']",,"Research and development of smart vessels has progressed significantly in recent years, and ships have become high-value technology-intensive resources. These ships entail high production costs and long-life cycles. Thus, modernized technical design, professional training, and aggressive maintenance are important factors in the efficient management of ships. With the continuing digital revolution, the industrial shipbuilding applicability of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies as well as related 3D system modeling and processes has increased. However, resolving the differences between AR/VR and real-world models remains burdensome. This problem is particularly evident when mapping various texture characteristics to virtual objects. To mitigate the burden and improve the performance of such technologies, it is necessary to directly define various texture characteristics or to express them using expensive equipment. The use of deep-learning-based CycleGAN, however, has gained attention as a method of learning and automatically mapping real-object textures. Thus, we seek to use CycleGAN to improve the immersive capacities of AR/VR models and to reduce production costs for shipbuilding. However, when applying CycleGAN’s textures to pipe structures, the performance is insufficient for direct application to industrial piping networks. Therefore, this study investigates an improved CycleGAN algorithm that can be specifically applied to the shipbuilding industry by combining a modified object-recognition algorithm with a double normalization method. Thus, we demonstrate that basic knowledge on the production of AR industrial pipe models can be applied to virtual models through machine learning to deliver low-cost and high-quality textures. Our results provide an on-ramp for future CycleGAN studies related to the shipbuilding industry."

In particular, in the case of port structures with a long service life, there are many problems in terms of safety and functionality due to increasing of the large-sized ships, of port use frequency, and the effects of natural disasters due to climate change. Method: In this study, the maintenance history data of the gravity type quay in element level were collected, defined as big data, and a predictive approximation model was derived to estimate the pattern of deterioration and aging of the facility of project level based on the data. In particular, we compared and proposed models suitable for the use of big data by examining the validity of the state-based deterioration pattern and deterioration approximation model generated through machine learning algorithms of GP and SGP techniques.

AI가 일종의 자유의지를 가지게 되는 것이라고 할 수 있다.  형사책임의 근거는 ‘자기의 행위가 불법이라는 것을 알거나 알 수 있었고, 그 인식에 따라 행동을 조정할 수 있었음에도 불구하고 적법한 행위를 하지 않고 불법한 행위를 하였다’는 점이다. 따라서 형사책임의 주체가 되기 위해서는 의사를 형성할 수 있어야 한다.  의식이란 ‘외부 자극에 대한 반응 능력’을 말한다. AI는 인지기능, 판단기능, 행동기능, 학습기능 등을 갖추고 있기 때문에 의식을 가지고 있다고 할 수 있다. AI가 아직 강한 인공지능의 단계에 본격적으로 돌입하지는 않았지만 인공지능의 오작동으로 인해서 사람이 사망하게 되는 일이 이미 벌어지고 있다. 이처럼 사람에게 위해를 가하는 일이 벌어졌을 때 AI를 제작한 프로그래머의 책임을 물을 수 없다면, 인공지능이 이에 대한 책임을 부담하도록 하는 수밖에 없다.  인공지능이 규범체계에 순응하도록 만들기 위해서는 자연인의 경우와 마찬가지로 사회화 과정을 거치게 하여야 한다. 인공지능이 인간의 뇌기능을 모방하여 뉴럴 네트워크를 기반으로 지성을 가지게 될 것이기 때문에 규범체계와 관련해서 사회화 과정을 거치는 것이 적절한 해법이라고 생각한다.  사회화 과정은 규범을 위반할 때 불이익을 가하고 규범을 준수할 때 칭찬을 하는 작업이 수없이 반복되면서 이루어진다. 인공지능이 사회화 과정을 거치도록 하기 위해서는 AI가 두려움을 느끼는 존재가 되어야 한다.

The stage in which AI works as it is programmed, no matter how complex the task, can be called weak artificial intelligence. Strong AI refers to a machine that has reached a stage where it can find behavioral guidelines through self-learning and change its own coding accordingly, going beyond the level of working according to the programmer""s coding instructions.  When it enters the stage of strong artificial intelligence, it becomes a situation in which the creator can no longer be held responsible for the actions of the artificial intelligence because the AI does not move according to the creator""s programming content. It can be said that AI will have a kind of free will.  The basis for criminal responsibility is that ‘they knew or could have known that their actions were illegal, and they acted illegally even though they were able to adjust their actions according to that recognition’. Therefore, in order to become a subject of criminal responsibility, one must be able to form a will.  Consciousness refers to the ability to respond to external stimuli. AI can be said to have consciousness because it has cognitive functions, judgment functions, behavior control functions, and learning functions. Although AI has not yet entered the stage of strong artificial intelligence, human deaths are already taking place due to malfunctions of artificial intelligence. If the programmer who created the AI cannot be held accountable when such harm to humans occurs, the only choice is to let the AI take responsibility for it.  In order for artificial intelligence to conform to the normative system, it must go through the socialization process as in the case of natural people. Since artificial intelligence will have intelligence based on neural networks by mimicking human brain functions, I think that going through the socialization process in relation to the normative system is an appropriate solution.  The socialization process is carried out by repeating countless repetitions of penalizing norms for violating norms and praising them for observing norms. In order for AI to go through the socialization process, it must become a fearful being. Only when AI becomes a being that can feel emotions such as fear can AI enter the normative system."

Using AI, there are high-level predictions in many fields of society. This high predictive power of AI is also being used in the field of crime prevention. In developed countries, crime prediction systems using big data and artificial intelligence have been introduced intensively in large cities with high crime rates. And they are producing tangible effects such as a decrease in the crime rate. The methods of such a crime prediction system can be broadly divided into 3 categories: ① crime prediction, ② criminal prediction, ③ crime victim prediction. Because of the limited scope of collection of sensitive personal information and protection of personal privacy, crime prediction, which predicts the time and place of a crime based on the crime risk by region and location, is mainly used rather than predicting criminals and victims. In this situation, the purpose of this study is to raise the problems that may appear in the crime prediction system for a specific person and to find a quick response method. Therefore, in this study, the problem of infringement of individual constitutional and legal rights that may occur when the crime prediction system is used for a specific person, the problem of opacity, inaccuracy and bias of the algorithm of the crime prediction system, and the problem of the crime prediction system as a new control means. We will review the potential problems and seek solutions to them. Since the crime prediction system for a specific person deals with the personal information of a specific person, it inevitably violates the basic rights such as privacy and freedom and the right to self-determination of personal information guaranteed by the Constitution. When targeting a specific person, the issue of equity with the general public may be raised. In addition, it is difficult to set clear limits on the extent to which target crimes are permitted. Artificial intelligence algorithms used in crime prediction systems have problems of opacity, bias, and inaccuracy. The opacity of artificial intelligence algorithms can make it difficult to find the cause of damage or responsibility due to inaccurate crime prediction. In addition, due to the potential bias and inaccuracy of artificial intelligence algorithms, crime prediction is being criticized for being unfair. And the crime prediction system is becoming a new means of control for citizens. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to first obtain the prior consent of the information subject according to Article 15 (1) 1 of the Personal Information Protection Act. The collection of personal information for a specific person for crime prediction should be limited to the minimum necessary within the scope of the purpose of the crime, and appropriate measures to avoid or improve the occurrence of erroneous results should be ensured in advance. It should be ensured that all personal information collection is subject to appropriate supervision by the supervisory authority. As a method of solving the opacity of the algorithm, it can be suggested to establish an organization or institution that examines and monitors the adequacy of the algorithm on behalf of the data subject or the general public. As a solution to bias and inaccuracy, the effectiveness of crime prevention through the crime prediction system should be proven and disclosed, and the accuracy of the crime prediction system algorithm should be guaranteed. The seriousness and risk of recidivism will be an important criterion for the selection of target crimes and targets for the crime prediction system. Crime prediction using the crime prediction system should be serious crimes such as murder, robbery, rape,"

Particularly, for automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, a benign audio which sounds normal could be decoded as a harmful command due to potential adversarial attacks. In this paper, we focus on the countermeasures against audio adversarial examples. By analyzing the characteristics of ASR systems, we find that frame offsets with silence clip appended at the beginning of an audio can degenerate adversarial perturbations to normal noise. For various scenarios, we exploit frame offsets by different strategies such as defending, detecting and hybrid strategy.

Currently, automobiles are being used to land transportation and living, and the scope of use and equipment is expanding. This rapid increase in automobiles has caused automobile insurance to emerge as an essential business target for insurance companies. Therefore, if the car insurance sales are predicted and sold using the information of existing health insurance customers, it can generate continuous profits in the insurance company s operating performance. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze existing customer characteristics and implement a predictive model to activate advertisements for customers interested in such auto insurance. The goal of this study is to maximize the profits of insurance companies by devising communication strategies that can optimize business models and profits for customers. This study was conducted through the Microsoft Azure program, and an automobile insurance purchase prediction model was implemented using Health Insurance Cross-sell Prediction data. The program algorithm uses Two-Class Logistic Regression and Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree at the same time to compare two models and predict and compare the results. According to the results of this study, when the Threshold is 0.3, the AUC is 0.837, and the accuracy is 0.833, which has high accuracy. Therefore, the result was that customers with health insurance could induce a positive reaction to auto insurance purchases."

The CNN comprised four combinations of convolution and pooling layers followed by two fully-connected layers. Numerous microscopic images of each cast iron were prepared to train and verify the CNN model. After training the network, the accuracy of the model was validated using an additional set of microstructural images which were not included in the training data. The CNN model exhibited an accuracy of approximately 98% for classification of the cast irons. Typically, CNN does not provide bases for image classification to human users. We tried to visualize the images between the network layers, to find out how the CNN identified the microstructures of the cast irons. The microstructural images shrank as they passed the convolutional and pooling layers. During the processes, it seems that the CNN detected morphological characteristics including the edges and contrast of the graphite phases. The mid-layer images still retained their characteristic microstructural features, although the image sizes were shrunk. The final images just before connecting the fully-connected layers seemed to have minimalized the information about the microstructural features to classify the two kinds of cast irons. Matrix phases such as ferrite and pearlite did not show prominent effects on the classification accuracy."

By employing the heterogeneous ensemble, it ensures different models that have a different initial assumption about the data are used to improve on diversity. Also, by using a stochastic algorithm with a decaying convergence rate, the model is designed to balance out the trade-off between model prediction performance and model convergence.

A customer credit Prediction Researched to Improve Credit Stability based on Artificial Intelligence,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'Lnear Regression', 'Boosted Decision Tree Regression', 'Credit loans', 'Credit Card', 'Delinquency']",,"In this Paper, Since the 1990s, Korea s credit card industry has steadily developed. As a result, various problems have arisen, such as careless customer information management and loans to low-credit customers. This, in turn, had a high delinquency rate across the card industry and a negative impact on the economy. Therefore, in this paper, based on Azure, we analyze and predict the delinquency and delinquency periods of credit loans according to gender, own car, property, number of children, education level, marital status, and employment status through linear regression analysis and enhanced decision tree algorithm. These predictions can consequently reduce the likelihood of reckless credit lending and issuance of credit cards, reducing the number of bad creditors and reducing the risk of banks. In addition, after classifying and dividing the customer base based on the predicted result, it can be used as a basis for reducing the risk of credit loans by developing a credit product suitable for each customer. The predicted result through Azure showed that when predicting with Linear Regression and Boosted Decision Tree algorithm, the Boosted Decision Tree algorithm made more accurate prediction. In addition, we intend to increase the accuracy of the analysis by assigning a number to each data in the future and predicting again."

Thus, the detection of MCCs plays an important role in diagnosing breast cancer. Methods: This paper presents a methodology for mammogram preprocessing and MCC detection. The preprocessing method employs automatic artefact deletion and pectoral muscle removal based on region-growing segmentation and polynomial contour fitting. The MCC detection method uses a convolutional neural network for region-of-interest (ROI) classification, along with morphological operations and wavelet reconstruction to reduce false positives (FPs). Results: The methodology was evaluated using the mini-MIAS and UTP datasets in terms of segmentation accuracy in the preprocessing phase, as well as sensitivity and the mean FP rate per image in the MCC detection phase. With the mini-MIAS dataset, the proposed methods achieved accuracy scores of 99% for breast segmentation and 95% for pectoral segmentation, a sensitivity score of 82% for MCC detection, and an FP rate per image of 3.27. With the UTP dataset, the methods achieved accuracy scores of 97% for breast segmentation and 91% for pectoral segmentation, a sensitivity score of 78% for MCC detection, and an FP rate per image of 0.74. Conclusions: The proposed preprocessing method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for breast segmentation and achieved relatively good results for pectoral muscle removal. Furthermore, the MCC detection module achieved the highest test accuracy in identifying potential ROIs with MCCs compared to other methods."

Therefore, in this study, we wanted to establish a classification model that classifies 8 medical subjects for symptom text directly described by patients which was collected from NAVER portal to help consumers choose appropriate medical subjects for their symptoms.In order to ensure the validity of the data involving patients’ subject matter, we conducted similarity measurements between objective symptom text (typical symptoms by medical subjects organized by the Seoul Emergency Medical Information Center) and subjective symptoms (NAVER data). Similarity measurements demonstrated that if the two texts were symptoms of the same medical subject, they had relatively higher similarity than symptomatic texts from different medical subjects. Following the above procedure, the classification model was constructed using a ridge regression model for subjective symptom text that obtained validity, resulting in an accuracy of 0.73."
Intelligent Massive Traffic Handling Scheme in 5G Bottleneck Backhaul Networks,2021,"['Cloud Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Traffic', 'Resource Allocation', 'Software-Defined Networking']",,"With the widespread deployment of the fifth-generation (5G) communication networks, various real-time applications are rapidly increasing and generating massive traffic on backhaul network environments. In this scenario, network congestion will occur when the communication and computation resources exceed the maximum available capacity, which severely degrades the network performance. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposed an intelligent resource allocation (IRA) to integrate with the extant resource adjustment (ERA) approach mainly based on the convergence of support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, software-defined networking (SDN), and mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigms. The proposed scheme acquires predictable schedules to adapt the downlink (DL) transmission towards off-peak hour intervals as a predominant priority. Accordingly, the peak hour bandwidth resources for serving real-time uplink (UL) transmission enlarge its capacity for a variety of mission-critical applications. Furthermore, to advance and boost gateway computation resources, MEC servers are implemented and integrated with the proposed scheme in this study. In the conclusive simulation results, the performance evaluation analyzes and compares the proposed scheme with the conventional approach over a variety of QoS metrics including network delay, jitter, packet drop ratio, packet delivery ratio, and throughput."

However, neural vocoders combined with mel-scaled spectrogram prediction models demand considerable computer memory and time during the training phase and are subject to slow inference speeds in an environment where GPU is not used. This problem does not arise in linear spectrogram prediction models, as they do not use neural vocoders, but these models suffer from low voice quality.

This type of prediction is linked with the national economy and people's livelihood, and is also one of the difficult problems in climatology. At present, there are some precipitation forecast models for the flood season, but there are also some deviations from these models, which makes it difficult to forecast accurately. In this paper, based on the measured precipitation data from the flood season from 1993 to 2019 and the precipitation return data of CWRF, ANN cycle modeling and a weighted integration method is used to correct the CWRF used in today’s operational systems. The MAE and TCC of the precipitation forecast in the flood season are used to check the prediction performance of the proposed algorithm model. The results demonstrate a good correction effect for the proposed algorithm. In particular, the MAE error of the new algorithm is reduced by about 50%, while the time correlation TCC is improved by about 40%. Therefore, both the generalization of the correction results and the prediction performance are improved."

Although the dynamic nature of echocardiography presents challenges beyond those of static images from X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and radioisotope imaging, AI has influenced all steps of echocardiography, from image acquisition to automatic measurement and interpretation. Considering that echocardiography often is affected by inter-observer variability and shows a strong dependence on the level of experience, AI could be extremely advantageous in minimizing observer variation and providing reproducible measures, enabling accurate diagnosis. Currently, most reported AI applications in echocardiographic measurement have focused on improved image acquisition and automation of repetitive and tedious tasks; however, the role of AI applications should not be limited to conventional processes. Rather, AI could provide clinically important insights from subtle and non-specific data, such as changes in myocardial texture in patients with myocardial disease. Recent initiatives to develop large echocardiographic databases can facilitate development of AI applications. The ultimate goal of applying AI to echocardiography is automation of the entire process of echocardiogram analysis. Once automatic analysis becomes reliable, workflows in clinical echocardiographic will change radically. The human expert will remain the master controlling the overall diagnostic process, will not be replaced by AI, and will obtain significant support from AI systems to guide acquisition, perform measurements, and integrate and compare data on request."

Average fidelity and fidelity deviation in noisy quantum teleportation,2021,['Quantum teleportation · Quantum machine learning'],,"We analyze the average fidelity (say, F) and the fidelity deviation (say, D) in noisy-channel quantum teleportation. Here, F represents how well teleportation is performed on average and D quantifies whether the teleportation is performed impartially on the given inputs, that is, the condition of universality. Our analysis results prove that the achievable maximum average fidelity ensures zero fidelity deviation, that is, perfect universality. This structural trait of teleportation is distinct from those of other limited-fidelity probabilistic quantum operations, for instance, universal-NOT or quantum cloning. This feature is confirmed again based on a tighter relationship between F and D in the qubit case. We then consider another realistic noise model where F decreases and D increases due to imperfect control. To alleviate such deterioration, we propose a machinelearning- based algorithm. We demonstrate by means of numerical simulations that the proposed algorithm can stabilize the system. Notably, the recovery process consists solely of the maximization of F, which reduces the control time, thus leading to a faster cure cycle."

The reflectance of healthy and infected leaves and branches was acquired with 5 nm of full width at high maximum (FWHM) and then it was standardized to 10 nm, 25 nm, 50 nm, and 80 nm of FWHM. The standardized samples were divided into training and test sets at ratios of 7:3, 5:5 and 3:7 to find the optimal bands of FWHM by the decision tree analysis. Classification accuracy was evaluated using overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (KC). The hyperspectral reflectance of infected leaves and branches was significantly lower than those of healthy green, red-edge (RE) and near infrared (NIR) regions. The bands selected for the first node were generally 750 and 800 nm; these were used to identify the infection of leaves and branches, respectively. The accuracy of the classifier was higher in the 7:3 ratio. Four bands with 50 nm of FWHM (450, 650, 750, and 950 nm) might be reasonable because the difference in the recalculated accuracy between 8 bands with 10 nm of FWHM (440, 580, 640, 660, 680, 710, 730, and 740 nm) and 4 bands was only 1.8% for OA and 4.1% for KC, respectively. Finally, adding two bands (550 nm and 800 nm with 25 nm of FWHM) in four bands with 50 nm of FWHM have been proposed to improve the usability of multispectral image sensors with performing various roles in agriculture as well as detecting FB with other combinations of spectral bands."

Therefore, we propose a combing Sparse Auto-Encoder and Load-Balancing, which is ProGReGA for Big-Data of server loads. In the process of Sparse Auto-Encoder, when it comes to selection of the feature-pattern, the less relevant feature-pattern could be eliminated from Big-Data. In relation to Load-Balancing, the alleviated degradation of ProGReGA can take advantage of the less redundant feature-pattern. That means the most relevant of Big-Data representation can work.

Using the method, the concentration distribution of solutes around a 2D droplet was estimated for actual flow data from PIV experiment."

Hitherto, customer credit risk is narrowed to the direct loss resulting from the borrower’s failure to contractual obligation of loan products. The indirect loss, such as legal and compliance liability, reputation damage, is usually neglected. The indirect loss is generally caused by providing services to customers who launch illegal transactions, such as money laundering and terrorist financing activities. As required by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, banks should strengthen the customer risk supervision and avoid providing services to abnormal customers. Usually, a customer needs to apply for an account before launching financial activities. Thus, a risk assessment at the account opening services can not only help the bank filter some fraudulent and criminal customers but also provide guidance on allocating the limited supervision resource. Conventionally, such a risk assessment procedure is labor-intensive. Given the massive business volume caused by digitalization, the problems of human resource shortage and high human errors caused by overburdened workload are even more serious. Yet, previous works only explored abnormal account activities supervision after account generation, whereas the automatic risk assessment method on account opening services is rarely covered. To address these problems, in this study, a novel preliminary risk level is firstly developed to indicate the different likelihood of risk levels in account opening service. In addition, an automatic risk level classifier is developed with a designed two-staged neural network utilizing geographic, demographic, and behavioral features. The experiment results verify the high classification accuracy at 96.7%. Moreover, given the similar compositions of international customers between Korea and Hong Kong, this work could also provide guidance to Korean banks on customer preliminary risk assessment."

Wave parameters are extracted using Modulation Transfer Function obtained from 3D wave number and frequency spectra which are calculated by 3D FFT of time series of sea surface images (42 images per minute). The accuracy of estimation of the significant wave height is, therefore, critically dependent on the quality of radar images. Wave observations during Typhoon Maysak and Haishen in the summer of 2020 show large errors in the estimation of the significant wave heights. It is because of the deteriorated radar images due to raindrops falling on the sea surface. This paper presents the algorithm developed to increase the accuracy of wave heights estimation from radar images by adopting convolution neural network(CNN) which automatically classify radar images into rain and non-rain cases. Then, an algorithm for deriving the Hs is proposed by creating different ANN models and selectively applying them according to the rain or non-rain cases. The developed algorithm applied to heavy rain cases during typhoons and showed critically improved results."

Governments and legislative bodies rely on insights from prediction models to suggest new policies and to assess the effectiveness of enforced policies. Therefore, access to accurate outbreak prediction models is essential to obtain insights into the likely spread and consequences of infectious diseases. The objective of this study is to predict the future COVID-19 situation of Korea. Here, we employed 5 models for this analysis; SEIR, local linear regression (LLR), negative binomial (NB) regression, segment Poisson, deep-learning based long short-term memory models (LSTM) and tree based gradient boosting machine (GBM). After prediction, model performance comparison was evelauated using relative mean squared errors (RMSE) for two sets of train (January 20, 2020-December 31, 2020 and January 20, 2020-January 31, 2021) and testing data (January 1, 2021-February 28, 2021 and February 1, 2021-February 28, 2021) . Except for segmented Poisson model, the other models predicted a decline in the daily confirmed cases in the country for the coming future. RMSE values' comparison showed that LLR, GBM, SEIR, NB, and LSTM respectively, performed well in the forecasting of the pandemic situation of the country. A good understanding of the epidemic dynamics would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Therefore, with increasing daily confirmed cases since this year, these results could help in the pandemic response by informing decisions about planning, resource allocation, and decision concerning social distancing policies."

The classification accuracy of these two methods is compared. Among the various types of MFCC-based color maps, the gist-rainbow method with better classification accuracy is chosen, and the 3-genre classification model is actually selected among several N-genre classification models. Furthermore, ensemble models overlapped for four genres is proposed and their classification accuracies are compared.

Re-SSS: Rebalancing Imbalanced Data Using Safe Sample Screening,2021,"['Imbalanced Data', 'Safe Sample Screening', 'Re-SSS-IS', 'Re-SSS-WSMOTE']",,"Different samples can have different effects on learning support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To rebalance an imbalanced dataset, it is reasonable to reduce non-informative samples and add informative samples for learning classifiers. Safe sample screening can identify a part of non-informative samples and retain informative samples. This study developed a resampling algorithm for Rebalancing imbalanced data using Safe Sample Screening (Re-SSS), which is composed of selecting Informative Samples (Re-SSS-IS) and rebalancing via a Weighted SMOTE (Re-SSS-WSMOTE). The Re-SSS-IS selects informative samples from the majority class, and determines a suitable regularization parameter for SVM, while the Re-SSS-WSMOTE generates informative minority samples. Both Re-SSS-IS and Re-SSS-WSMOTE are based on safe sampling screening. The experimental results show that Re-SSS can effectively improve the classification performance of imbalanced classification problems."

Subsequently, these curves are inputted to a back propagation network as training samples to learn their relationships. The results show that the deformation value of trained neural network is very close to that of the total station, with a maximum error of only 2.7% (0.3 mm).

Crime hotspot prediction based on dynamic spatial analysis,2021,"['big data analytics', 'linear regression', 'machine learning', 'spatial analysis', 'time‐series prediction']",,"Crime is not a completely random event but rather shows a pattern in space and time. Capturing the dynamic nature of crime patterns is a challenging task. Crime prediction models that rely only on neighborhood influence and demographic features might not be able to capture the dynamics of crime patterns, as demographic data collection does not occur frequently and is static. This work proposes a novel approach for crime count and hotspot prediction to capture the dynamic nature of crime patterns using taxi data along with historical crime and demographic data. The proposed approach predicts crime events in spatial units and classifies each of them into a hotspot category based on the number of crime events. Four models are proposed, which consider different covariates to select a set of independent variables. The experimental results show that the proposed combined subset model (CSM), in which static and dynamic aspects of crime are combined by employing the taxi dataset, is more accurate than the other models presented in this study."

In the writing class for this study, 17 students were taught how to effectively utilize MT and asked to actively use MT in English writing practices over 10 weeks. A qualitative comparison of the learners’ direct writings conducted before and after the 10 weeks of training confirmed that the use of MT helped improve learners’ general English writing skills. However, the learner’s improvement in writing skills exhibited no significant correlation with his English proficiency, nor with the increase in his writing confidence. This result implies that the success or failure of the class may depend more on the degree of reflective learning on the part of the student than on such fixed factors as the student’s proficiency and the use of MT."

Various solutions such as firewalls, VPNs, and virtualization systems are introduced to respond to threats from outsiders, and as a result, the number of cases of information leakage caused by threats from outsiders is greatly reduced. However, information leakage through threats from insiders is more damaging than threats from outsiders, making it difficult to detect in advance, and the amount of damage after information leakage can be much larger. In order to prevent information leakage through smartphone filming, which is one of insider's information leakage path, it currently uses hardware, smartphone camera security stickers, screen security films, and software uses smartphone MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions to limit functions such as smartphone photography and data communication. In this paper, we propose a study on the information leakage protection system through smartphone shooting by installing a camera on a PC with access to sensitive information, collecting video information from cameras and designing a smartphone object detection algorithm. For this purpose, the camera is installed at the top of the center of the screen. Image frames are transmitted in real time from camera. In addition, real-time object detection is possible using YOLO, which has fast computational speed. The purpose of this paper is to develop a system for detecting smartphone objects from video information inputted from cameras. As a result, information leakage can be protected by taking pictures of smartphones."

Second, the research topics related to artificial intelligence marketing were classified into 10 fields, and the trends of AI marketing research in Korea were analyzed.[Results] As a result of the analysis, after the Go match between AlphaGo and Lee Se-dol, AI marketing research has rapidly increased, but most of them have been reported in a small number of related journals, and research has been focused on the University of Business and Engineering. In addition, while overseas research is active not only in B2B but also in the field of B2C marketing, most of it in Korea has been studied only in the field of B2C marketing.[Conclusion] Although domestic AI marketing research has recently attracted attention, it is only an repeated test for the concept and theory of overseas preceding research.

Proximal Policy Optimization-based Join Order Optimization with Spark SQL,2021,"['Join order optimization', 'Deep reinforcement learning', 'Spark SQL']",,"In a smart grid, massive amounts of data are generated during the production, transmission, and consumption of electricity. Often, complex and varied queries with multiple join and selection operations need to be run on such data. Several studies have focused on improving the performance of query evaluation by applying machine learning techniques to query optimization problems. However, these studies are limited to processing queries for data in a single environment. In this paper, we propose a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based join order optimization model for use on Spark SQL to improve the retrieval performance for large amounts of data. The model uses the cost computation method of Spark SQL for training with the costs of the join plans generated by the model as rewards. The model can find more join plans with lower costs than the plans that Spark SQL finds because Spark SQL is limited to a low search space. We demonstrate that the proposed model generates join plans with similar or lower costs than Spark SQL without executing the optimization algorithm of Spark SQL."

Between Familiarity and Unfamiliarity : Users' Perception and Intention of Watching Netflix Artwork,2021,"['Personalized Artworks of Movie', 'Positive Unfamiliarity', 'Negative Unfamiliarity', 'Intention to Watch']",,"Background Personalization service through AI and ML (machine learning) plays a significant role in the success of Netflix. Netflix's personalized recommendation service is not only applied to the content but also to Netflix artworks. The first thing users encounter when choosing content at the OTT service platform is artwork. Users explore and formulate choices with the artwork. The artwork is the first impression to attract users and an important factor affecting the decision what to watch. This study seeks to determine viewer’s perception and intention of watching of Netflix's personalized artwork. We speculatedwondered whether Netflix artwork's personalization replaces the movie poster's image too familiar to attract attention or if it overlooks the anchoring and the primacy effect's benefits.Methods We hypothesized and surveyed whether there is a difference in viewing intention according to the type of artwork. In addition, we set a hypothesis to see if the more we accept personalized artwork as positive and negative unfamiliarity, the more it affects the viewing intention. We chose Parasite, which is well known to the public and The Devil All the Time as a less well-known content. To answer these hypotheses, we surveyed a total of 152 respondents. The results of the survey were statistically verified through one-way analysis of variance and simple regression.Results For Parasite , the main poster type's artwork derives users' intention of watching by anchoring effect and primacy effect. On the other hand, personalized artwork produced by converting genres or focusing on supporting actors negatively affected their intention of watching.Meanwhile, for The Devil All the Time, the main poster was less known to users in Korea. Therefore, there was little anchoring and primacy effect since users did not recognize the main poster as representative images of the movie. In this case, not only the main poster type, but also the artwork with the leading actor's image, and the artwork with the overall atmosphere of the movie can draw the users' intention of watching. In both films, the more the respondents felt the negative unfamiliarity of the artwork that gives them the impression that the movie seems like a formula film, the less intention of watching.Conclusions It was revealed that personalized artworks do not only attract viewers' positive perceptions and can interfere with the viewer's intention to watch. Based on this, it is expected that the study will help to produce artwork for the OTT service."

Our objective is to find the optimal schedules which minimize makespan, mean flow time, or total absolute differences in completion times (TADC) of the jobs. We characterize the optimal schedules for each scheduling measure and show the optimal scheduling rules to solve the problems with 0(n log n) time. Furthermore, we show that the problems for minimization a weighted sum of makespan and mean flow time are also solved in polynomial-time complexity. The optimal schedules for the bi-criteria are useful for the various environments by fitting the weight of each criterion, makespan and mean flow time, on the aim of the scheduling in the environments."
Object detection in financial reporting documents for subsequent recognition,2021,"['segmentation', 'neural networks', 'RetinaNet', 'document analysis', 'machine learning.']",,"Document page segmentation is an important step in building a quality optical character recognition module. The study examined already existing work on the topic of page segmentation and focused on the development of a segmentation model that has greater functional significance for application in an organization, as well as broad capabilities for managing the quality of the model. The main problems of document segmentation were highlighted, which include a complex background of intersecting objects. As classes for detection, not only classic text, table and figure were selected, but also additional types, such as signature, logo and table without borders (or with partially missing borders). This made it possible to pose a non-trivial task of detecting nonstandard document elements. The authors compared existing neural network architectures for object detection based on published research data. The most suitable architecture was RetinaNet. To ensure the possibility of quality control of the model, a method based on neural network modeling using the RetinaNet architecture is proposed. During the study, several models were built, the quality of which was assessed on the test sample using the Mean average Precision metric. The best result among the constructed algorithms was shown by a model that includes four neural networks: the focus of the first neural network on detecting tables and tables without borders, the second - seals and signatures, the third - pictures and logos, and the fourth - text. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that the approach based on four neural networks showed the best results in accordance with the objectives of the study on the test sample in the context of most classes of detection. The method proposed in the article can be used to recognize other objects. A promising direction in which the analysis can be continued is the segmentation of tables; the areas of the table that differ in function will act as classes: heading, cell with a name, cell with data, empty cell."

Existing methods include using a 3D electromagnetic field simulation program or equations based on the Floquet theory. However, these have limitations. In this study, we verified a new method for predicting the stopband using a convolutional neural network(CNN). Specifically, a CNN architectural model was used to compare structures that perform well in predicting the stopband. It was also used to confirm that the DenseNet showed high performance."

Speech intelligibility is a complex measure that is affected by the features of multiple speech dimensions. However, most previous studies are restricted to using features from a single speech dimension. To effectively capture the characteristics of the speech disorder, we extracted features of multiple speech dimensions: voice quality, prosody, and pronunciation. Voice quality consists of jitter, shimmer, Harmonic to Noise Ratio (HNR), number of voice breaks, and degree of voice breaks. Prosody includes speech rate (total duration, speech duration, speaking rate, articulation rate), pitch (F0 mean/std/min/max/med/25quartile/75 quartile), and rhythm (%V, deltas, Varcos, rPVIs, nPVIs). Pronunciation contains Percentage of Correct Phonemes (Percentage of Correct Consonants/Vowels/Total phonemes) and degree of vowel distortion (Vowel Space Area, Formant Centralized Ratio, Vowel Articulatory Index, F2-Ratio). Experiments were conducted using various feature combinations. The experimental results indicate that using features from all three speech dimensions gives the best result, with a 80.15 F1-score, compared to using features from just one or two speech dimensions. The result implies voice quality, prosody, and pronunciation features should all be considered in automatic severity classification of dysarthria."

LSTM Prediction of Streamflow during Peak Rainfall of Piney River,2021,"['Flood management', 'Disaster mitigation', 'Deep learning', 'Streamflow', 'LSTM']",,"Streamflow prediction is a very vital disaster mitigation approach for effective flood management and water resources planning. Lately, torrential rainfall caused by climate change has been reported to have increased globally, thereby causing enormous infrastructural loss, properties and lives. This study evaluates the contribution of rainfall to streamflow prediction in normal and peak rainfall scenarios, typical of the recent flood at Piney Resort in Vernon, Hickman County, Tennessee, United States. Daily streamflow, water level, and rainfall data for 20 years (2000-2019) from two USGS gage stations (03602500 upstream and 03599500 downstream) of the Piney River watershed were obtained, preprocesssed and fitted with Long short term memory (LSTM) model. Tensorflow and Keras machine learning frameworks were used with Python to predict streamflow values with a sequence size of 14 days, to determine whether the model could have predicted the flooding event in August 21, 2021. Model skill analysis showed that LSTM model with full data (water level, streamflow and rainfall) performed better than the Naive Model except some rainfall models, indicating that only rainfall is insufficient for streamflow prediction. The final LSTM model recorded optimal NSE and RMSE values of 0.68 and 13.84 m3 /s and predicted peak flow with the lowest prediction error of 11.6%, indicating that the final model could have predicted the flood on August 24, 2021 given a peak rainfall scenario.

Research started in the 1950s went through several ups and downs and reached the same period of the third boom as it is now. With the shocking situation where Alpha Go defeated Lee Se-dol, the strongest player in Go, in 2016, interest in artificial intelligence increased rapidly, and stories about the future situations that artificial intelligence will bring about, such as the possibility and singularity of artificial intelligence, are talked about even among the general public. Certainly, artificial intelligence has the potential to fundamentally change the way humans live, not just technological advances.The real value of artificial intelligence algorithms is prediction. At the center of all the algorithmic revolutions that have taken place in the various fields of modern society, there is one unchanging purpose: prediction. The algorithm for predicting the risk of recidivism used in US law enforcement fits precisely with the principle that individual humans behave in a predictable and consistent manner. While using the algorithm of predicting the risk of a second offender, an artificial intelligence algorithm, not a judge, actually takes the place of the defendant's decision on whether or not to be arrested or sentenced. Automated decision making continues to grow at an unprecedented rate and benefits because machine learning offers the possibility to extend the automated decision-making process, allowing wider, deeper decisions without human intervention. It is also very large and is expected to continue to expand its use.However, the risks are as great as the benefits of artificial intelligence algorithms. The risks of artificial intelligence algorithms outweigh the individual risks of any algorithmic technology specifically applied. Despite the widespread use of artificial intelligence in the social sphere, the reality is that the problems of artificial intelligence cannot be properly grasped. However, people who were treated differently due to automatic decision-making by artificial intelligence began to question the fairness or fairness of artificial intelligence, and in particular, while causing sensitive problems such as discriminatory results, controversy surrounding artificial intelligence algorithms gradually became more and more controversial. It is expanding. Even if a decision made by artificial intelligence is wrong or causes negative effects such as discrimination, there is a big problem that there are few means to object to this. In a situation where automated decision-making is more likely to threaten human autonomy and dignity, in order to secure an individual's autonomous personality, make sure that the entire process of the individual's automatic decision-making that affects him or her is fair and error-free. It is of utmost importance to know and allow humans to directly intervene if necessary.Although available data is increasing and algorithms are gradually improving, artificial intelligence algorithms do not completely eliminate the uncertainty posed by decision making.Eventually, there are cases in which humans, as finalists, have to make important decisions in situations where uncertainty has not been resolved. It is necessary to build a system in which artificial intelligence algorithms and human experts cooperate well to make the best decisions, and in addition to the direction of such a collaboration system establishment, the problem of legal responsibility due to errors in decision-making in artificial intelligence algorithms or collaboration systems is necessary. I want to deal with it in this paper."

To solve this problem, a multimode convolution neural network method is proposed to effectively improve the performance of facial expression recognition in video. Firstly, OpenFace 2.0 is used to detect face images in video, and two deep convolution neural networks are used to extract spatiotemporal expression features. Furthermore, spatial convolution neural network is used to extract the spatial information features of each static expression image, and the dynamic information feature is extracted from the optical flow information of multiple expression images based on temporal convolution neural network. Then, the spatiotemporal features learned by the two deep convolution neural networks are fused by multiplication. Finally, the fused features are input into support vector machine to realize the facial expression classification. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the proposed method can reach 64.57% and 60.89%, respectively on RML and Baum-ls datasets.

Subsequently, the data cleansing process including missing value detection and normalization was followed by the establishment of approximately 600,000 refined datasets. We analyzed the correlation of 42 factors collected to predict the occurrence of black ice by selecting only 21 factors that have a valid effect on black ice prediction.

The algorithm bias has the characteristic of being intervened in the system construction process as the computer becomes an artificial neural network-based autonomous intelligence system. The objective of this paper is to deal with the aspects of bias that are involved in each stage of artificial intelligence, the fairness criterion for the judgment of bias, and the bias mitigation methods. Different types of fairness are difficult to satisfy simultaneously and require different combinations of criteria and factors depending on the field and context of AI application. Each method for mitigating the bias of training data, classifiers, and prediction alone do not completely block the bias, and a balance between bias mitigation and accuracy should be sought. Even if bias is identified through unlimited access to the algorithm through AI auditing, it is difficult to determine whether the algorithm is biased. The bias mitigation technology goes beyond simply removing the bias, and is moving toward solving the problem of both reducing the bias and securing the robustness of the system, and adjusting the various types of fairness. In conclusion, these characteristics imply that policies and education that recognize AI biases and seek solutions should be explored in terms of bias recognition and coordination based on system understanding beyond recognizing issues at the conceptual level."
A Context-aware Task Offloading Scheme in Collaborative Vehicular Edge Computing Systems,2021,"['Differential Evolution', 'Mobile Edge Computing', 'Machine Learning', 'Computing Offloading', 'Context-aware']",,"With the development of mobile edge computing (MEC), some late-model application technologies, such as self-driving, augmented reality (AR) and traffic perception, emerge as the times require. Nevertheless, the high-latency and low-reliability of the traditional cloud computing solutions are difficult to meet the requirement of growing smart cars (SCs) with computing-intensive applications. Hence, this paper studies an efficient offloading decision and resource allocation scheme in collaborative vehicular edge computing networks with multiple SCs and multiple MEC servers to reduce latency. To solve this problem with effect, we propose a context-aware offloading strategy based on differential evolution algorithm (DE) by considering vehicle mobility, roadside units (RSUs) coverage, vehicle priority. On this basis, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is employed to predict idle computing resources according to the base station traffic in different periods. Simulation results demonstrate that the practical performance of the context-aware vehicular task offloading (CAVTO) optimization scheme could reduce the system delay significantly."
Data Correction For Enhancing Classification Accuracy By Unknown Deep Neural Network Classifiers,2021,"['Data correction', 'Deep neural network', 'Ensemble method', 'Machine learning', 'Poisoning attack']",,"Deep neural networks provide excellent performance in pattern recognition, audio classification, and image recognition. It is important that they accurately recognize input data, particularly when they are used in autonomous vehicles or for medical services. In this study, we propose a data correction method for increasing the accuracy of an unknown classifier by modifying the input data without changing the classifier. This method modifies the input data slightly so that the unknown classifier will correctly recognize the input data. It is an ensemble method that has the characteristic of transferability to an unknown classifier by generating corrected data that are correctly recognized by several classifiers that are known in advance. We tested our method using MNIST and CIFAR-10 as experimental data. The experimental results exhibit that the accuracy of the unknown classifier is a 100% correct recognition rate owing to the data correction generated by the proposed method, which minimizes data distortion to maintain the data’s recognizability by humans."

Object detection in financial reporting documents for subsequent recognition,2021,"['segmentation', 'neural networks', 'RetinaNet', 'document analysis', 'machine learning']",,"Document page segmentation is an important step in building a quality optical character recognition module. The study examined already existing work on the topic of page segmentation and focused on the development of a segmentation model that has greater functional significance for application in an organization, as well as broad capabilities for managing the quality of the model. The main problems of document segmentation were highlighted, which include a complex background of intersecting objects. As classes for detection, not only classic text, table and figure were selected, but also additional types, such as signature, logo and table without borders (or with partially missing borders). This made it possible to pose a non-trivial task of detecting non-standard document elements. The authors compared existing neural network architectures for object detection based on published research data. The most suitable architecture was RetinaNet. To ensure the possibility of quality control of the model, a method based on neural network modeling using the RetinaNet architecture is proposed. During the study, several models were built, the quality of which was assessed on the test sample using the Mean average Precision metric. The best result among the constructed algorithms was shown by a model that includes four neural networks: the focus of the first neural network on detecting tables and tables without borders, the second - seals and signatures, the third - pictures and logos, and the fourth - text. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that the approach based on four neural networks showed the best results in accordance with the objectives of the study on the test sample in the context of most classes of detection. The method proposed in the article can be used to recognize other objects. A promising direction in which the analysis can be continued is the segmentation of tables; the areas of the table that differ in function will act as classes: heading, cell with a name, cell with data, empty cell."

With the conventional method, the memory access interval for image processing was fixed, which limited the processing speed. In this work, we developed a novel memory access method that dynamically controls the intervals between memory access requests for image processing by monitoring the memory status. We implemented an image processing system with the proposed method and examined its characteristics. The maximum processing speed with the proposed method reached 30.7 fps, which was 1.65 times faster than that of the conventional method."

Study of scale-free structures in feed-forward neural networks against backdoor attacks,2021,"['Feed-forward neural networks', 'Scale-free networks', 'Backdoor attack']",,"Due to the computational complexities of artificial neural networks, MLaaS (machine learning as a service), which is one of the main cloud computing services, is taking the responsibility of the neural network training. With the increase in demand for third-party neural network training, there is a high possibility of adversarial attacks through malicious training. Backdoor attacks are among the most efficient attacks which cause targeted misclassification while the accuracy on clean data is not affected. In this paper, we provide the first investigation about the influence of applying scale-free networks to feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) against backdoor attacks inserted via the MNIST dataset. It is the first time that the feed-forward neural network structure is changed to improve the network robustness against backdoor attacks using scale-free structure before the network is getting attacked. It has been achieved that scale-free neural networks with long range connections not only keep the accuracy high with strong stability but also make it independent of the number of hidden layers and prevent overfitting."
Few-Shot Image Synthesis using Noise-Based Deep Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets,2021,"['font', 'font styles', 'computer vision', 'image generation', 'generative adversarial networks']",,"In recent years research on automatic font generation with machine learning mainly focus on using transformation-based methods, in comparison, generative model-based methods of font generation have received less attention. Transformation-based methods learn a mapping of the transformations from an existing input to a target. This makes them ambiguous because in some cases a single input reference may correspond to multiple possible outputs. In this work, we focus on font generation using the generative model-based methods which learn the buildup of the characters from noise-to-image. We propose a novel way to train a conditional generative deep neural model so that we can achieve font style control on the generated font images. Our research demonstrates how to generate new font images conditioned on both character class labels and character style labels when using the generative model-based methods. We achieve this by introducing a modified generator network which is given inputs noise, character class, and style, which help us to calculate losses separately for the character class labels and character style labels. We show that adding the character style vector on top of the character class vector separately gives the model rich information about the font and enables us to explicitly specify not only the character class but also the character style that we want the model to generate."

The new articles from media were selected to find out the present of education so that we can figure out the appropriateness of the proposed framework to predict the future of education. Research findings reveal that gradual tendencies of topics could not be found except teacher education and they are diverse from characteristics of agents (students and teachers) to the curriculum and pedagogical strategies. On the other hand, the results of analysis on the media articles focuses more on the projects launched by the government and the immediate responses to the COVID-19, as well as educational technologies related to big data and artificial intelligence. It is surprising that only a few key words are occupied in the latest articles from the literature review and many of them have not been discussed before. This indicates that the predictive framework is not effective to establish the long-term plan for education due to the uncertainty of educational environment, and thus this study will give some implications for developing the model to forecast the future of education."

Recently, there is an increasing number of cases of using the accumulated big data of universities to prepare measures to fill new students. A representative example of this is the analysis of factors that affect student employment. Existing employment-influencing factor analysis studies have applied quantitative models such as regression analysis to university big data. However, since the factors affecting employment differ by major, it is necessary to reflect this. In this paper, the factors affecting employment by major are analyzed using the data of University C and the decision tree model. In addition, based on the analysis results, a roadmap for student employment by major is recommended. As a result of the experiment, four decision tree models were constructed for each major, and factors affecting employment by major and roadmap were derived."

From a sociobiological point of view, humans are beings who live a social life and engage in altruistic cooperation. From the point of view of brain science, humans suppress instinct through the frontal lobe and think rationally, and at the same time empathize and solidarize with the suffering of others through the mirror neuron system. From an anthropological point of view, humans have increased kin altruism, collective altruism, reciprocal altruism, and ethical altruism. From a semiotic and phenomenological point of view, humans achieved a cognitive revolution by fusing natural intelligence, scientific and technological intelligence, and social intelligence through metaphor, metonymy, and image schema. And they interpret the world in front of them, and aim for meaning, and practice it.When these are fused, human beings, as biological beings, are a survival machine controlled by selfish genes, and at the same time, as social beings, form society and cooperate altruistically.Humans are beings that seek existence by overcoming anxiety and alienation and are interdependent becomings that depend on others, act as conditions and causality, and become with each other. Accordingly, humans suppress or restrain desire or selfish instincts, and pursue moral rationality, and empathize and solidarize with others to achieve true self-realization, and to gain the approval of others, and to make others freer.As aesthetic beings, human beings seek more beautiful things despite wasting energy. As transcendent beings, human beings seek perfection from imperfection, holiness from vulgarity, and infinity from finiteness.No matter how we view human nature, religion, philosophy, and art that have seen human nature statically must be revised. Human nature fluctuates according to 12 factors: labor, the system of distributing values, communication and empathy with others, and group learning, etc. Nevertheless, we must note that in an egalitarian commune there are few evildoers as everyone promotes goodness and altruism to one another."

However, due to structural characteristics such as vertical symbolism, high-rise buildings pose a fire threat from various fire factors. Therefore, fire prevention and countermeasures that can minimize social loss are required. Therefore, in this study, for effective fire prevention and response in high-rise building fires, using public data from Korean National Fire Agency, the influence of fire factors that affect property damage depending on whether sprinklers operate or not, and From the analysis results, we suggest a systematic improvement plan. In this paper, an independent variable for fire impact analysis based on maching learning, a field of artificial intelligence, was selected through the significant probability and Pearson correlation analysis between property damage and fire factors of high-rise building fires, and the random forest technique was used to determine the effects of sprinkler operation on property damage. The importance of fire factors was calculated. As a result of the analysis, the importance of fire factors affecting property damage in high-rise building fires was analyzed in the order of fire suppression time, number of firefighters and police officers, fire station street, and number of building floors. From this, the fire extinguishing time requires pluralistic measures to reduce property damage regardless of whether the sprinkler is in operation. As for the number of building floors, the impact on property damage reduction when the sprinkler is not in operation is 75%p of the relative importance compared to the case in which the sprinkler is operated. Therefore, it was found that the policy system regarding the installation and operation of sprinklers needs to be improved."

However, there is still a lot of time is needed for the preventive effect by the vaccine to come out. Therefore, it can be said that the development of an infectious disease treatment that can be used when contracting COVID-19 is a very important issue. However, developing a treatment for COVID-19 requires more time than developing a vaccine. There are many reasons, but among the many drug candidates that can be used in remedy, until a good drug candidate is found that can inhibit or overcome COVID-19, experiments on cell culture and chemical reactions must continue and iteratively, and the results of the chemical reaction must be evaluated. This is because researchers have to check and make judgments one by one. Therefore, in this paper, in order to shorten the clinical trial time required for the development of a remedy agent for the COVID-19, we designed a system that can automatically transform and show the chemical reaction result when a candidate drugs are administered to the COVID-19 virus in a short time and the performance was evaluated. A style transformation model based on StarGAN-v2 designed in this paper supports conversion between multiple styles. In addition, using the automated style transformation model, a candidate drug or compound is directly administered to a specific virus cell and the results can be simulated quickly without waiting for the results of a clinical trial waiting for the results. Therefore, if the style transformation model designed in this paper is used as a simulator for administration results in the clinical trial stage of new drug development, it will be able to contribute to shortening the clinical trial procedure and time"

A New Hybrid Approach of Clustering Based Probabilistic Decision Tree to Forecast Wind Power on Large Scales,2021,['Wind power forecast  · K-means clustering  · NB tree  · Machine learning  · Windfarm'],,"The wind power forecasting plays a vital role in renewable energy production. Due to the dynamic and uncertain behavior of wind, it is really hard to catch the actual features of wind for accurate forecasting measures. The patchy and instability of wind leading to the assortment of training samples have a main infl uence on the forecasting accuracy. For this purpose, an accurate forecasting method is needed. This paper proposed a new hybrid approach of clustering based probabilistic decision tree to forecast wind power effi ciently. The collected data is screened for noisy information and selected those variables which mainly contribute in accurate predictions. Then, the wind data is normalized using mean and standard deviation to extract playing level fi elds for each feature. Based on the similarity of the data behavior, the K-means clustering algorithm is applied to classify the samples into diff erent groups which contain the historical wind data. Further, the Naïve Bayes (NB) tree is proposed to extract probabilities for each feature in the clusters. The NB tree is a hybrid model of C4.5 and NB methods that successfully applied on three big real-world wind datasets (hourly, monthly, yearly) collected from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The forecasting accuracy exposed that the proposed method could forecast an accurate wind power from hours to years’ data. Comprehensive comparisons are made of the proposed method with the most popular state of the art techniques which show that this method provides more accurate prediction results."

Firstly, an experiment was performed using simulator linkage and actual process operation information. As a result, it was possible to obtain effects such as reducing overshooting when the target load was reached when linking the simulator. Secondly, an experiment was performed using actual operation information for optimizing combustion-related variables. However. the result of optimization by MPC solution was difficult to apply to actual process control. This is because the mechanical power generation control system is designed for the purpose of following the demand load, ① it is difficult to define a clear causal relationship between the process operation variables and nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, and ② data preprocessing techniques for handling disturbances and time delays.

Unlike other plant characteristics, barks show only little change regardless of the season and are maintained for a long period. Nevertheless, barks show a complex shape with a large variation depending on the environment, and there are insufficient materials that can be utilized to train algorithms. Here, in addition to the previously published bark image dataset, BarkNet v.1.0, images of barks were collected, and a dataset consisting of 53 tree species that can be easily observed in Korea was presented. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained and tested on the dataset, and the factors that interfere with the model's performance were identified. For CNN architecture, VGG-16 and 19 were utilized. As a result, VGG-16 achieved 90.41% and VGG-19 achieved 92.62% accuracy. When tested on new tree images that do not exist in the original dataset but belong to the same genus or family, it was confirmed that more than 80% of cases were successfully identified as the same genus or family. Meanwhile, it was found that the model tended to misclassify when there were distracting features in the image, including leaves, mosses, and knots. In these cases, we propose that random cropping and classification by majority votes are valid for improving possible errors in training and inferences."

Optimizations of such routines, including GEMM, have been conducted by vendors and researches with auto-tuning techniques. To achieve high performance for parallel matrix multiplication, a matrix multiplication processing scheme based on the optimization of local matrix multiplication at each node should be necessarily applied. In this paper, the application of parallel double-precision general matrix multiplication (PDGEMM) on Intel KNL was examined. The application of DGEMM calculated sub-matrices multiplication at each node. Details of the proposed DGEMM were introduced, including a blocked matrix multiplication algorithm with AVX-512 instruction sets and several optimization techniques, such as the data prefetching, loop unrolling, and cache blocking. This study found that the proposed PDGEMM performance was better than that in the ordinary cases of PDGEMM from the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) on both 4 and 16-node KNL clusters, with the flop rate improvements of 6% and 68%, respectively."

Fault Classification of a Blade Pitch System in a Floating Wind Turbine Based on a Recurrent Neural Network,2021,"['Floating wind turbine', 'Blade pitch system', 'Fault diagnosis', 'Machine learning', 'Gated recurrent units']",,"This paper describes a recurrent neural network (RNN) for the fault classification of a blade pitch system of a spar-type floating wind turbine. An artificial neural network (ANN) can effectively recognize multiple faults of a system and build a training model with training data for decision-making. The ANN comprises an encoder and a decoder. The encoder uses a gated recurrent unit, which is a recurrent neural network, for dimensionality reduction of the input data. The decoder uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for diagnosis decision-making. To create data, we use a wind turbine simulator that enables fully coupled nonlinear time-domain numerical simulations of offshore wind turbines considering six fault types including biases and fixed outputs in pitch sensors and excessive friction, slit lock, incorrect voltage, and short circuits in actuators. The input data are time-series data collected by two sensors and two control inputs under the condition that of one fault of the six types occurs. A gated recurrent unit (GRU) that is one of the RNNs classifies the suggested faults of the blade pitch system. The performance of fault classification based on the gate recurrent unit is evaluated by a test procedure, and the results indicate that the proposed scheme works effectively. The proposed ANN shows a 1.4% improvement in its performance compared to an MLP-based approach."

In addition, it is necessary to double-verify production data by using automatic data collection technology so that the production process can be traced transparently. In this study, we want to show a case of data-centered integration of a large aircraft parts processing factory that requires high precision, takes a long time, and has the characteristics of processing large raw materials. For this, the components of the data-oriented integrated production system were identified and the connection structure between them was explained.

To overcome this situation, universities are seeking ways to use big data within the school to improve the quality of education. A study on the prediction of dropout students is a representative case of using big data in universities. The dropout prediction can prepare a systematic management plan by identifying students who will drop out of school due to reasons such as dropout or expulsion. In the case of actual on-campus data, a large number of missing values are included because it is collected and managed by various departments. For this reason, it is necessary to construct a model by effectively reflecting the missing values. In this study, we propose a university student dropout prediction model based on eXtreme Gradient Boost that can be applied to data with many missing values and shows high performance. In order to examine the practical applicability of the proposed model, an experiment was performed using data from C University in Chungbuk. As a result of the experiment, the prediction performance of the proposed model was found to be excellent. The management strategy of dropout students can be established through the prediction results of the model proposed in this paper."

To find out the impact of side-jets on aerodynamic coefficients, we simulate side-jets as air gas and utilize multi-fidelity models to evaluate differences between aerodynamic coefficients obtained with and without side-jets. We computed differences in aerodynamic coefficients to investigate side-jet effects for the changes of a Mach number, a bank angle, and an angle of attack. As a result, asymmetrically developed side-jets affect the longitudinal force and moment coefficients, and the lateral force and moment coefficients drastically change in-between -30 and 30 degrees of bank angles. In contrast, side-jets hardly influence the axial force coefficients. As for the axial moment coefficient, we could not determine the side-jet effect due to a lack of aerodynamic coefficient samples in the Mach number. All in all, we confirm that side-jets lead to the change of a missile attitude as they considerably vary the longitudinal and lateral aerodynamic coefficients."

Forty patients of them also underwent a 6-month follow-up CMR. The CMR protocol included T2-weighted imaging, T1 mapping, rest first-pass perfusion, and late gadolinium enhancement. Radiomics features were extracted from the T1 maps using open-source software. Radiomics signatures were constructed with the selected strongest features to evaluate the myocardial injury severity and predict the recovery of left ventricular (LV) longitudinal systolic myocardial contractility.Results: A total of 1088 segments of the acute CMR images were analyzed; 103 (9.5%) segments showed microvascular obstruction (MVO), and 557 (51.2%) segments showed MI. A total of 640 segments were included in the 6-month follow-up analysis, of which 160 (25.0%) segments showed favorable recovery of LV longitudinal systolic myocardial contractility. Combined radiomics signature and T1 values resulted in a higher diagnostic performance for MVO compared to T1 values alone (area under the curve [AUC] in the training set; 0.88, 0.72, p = 0.031: AUC in the test set; 0.86, 0.71, p = 0.002). Combined radiomics signature and T1 values also provided a higher predictive value for LV longitudinal systolic myocardial contractility recovery compared to T1 values (AUC in the training set; 0.76, 0.55, p < 0.001: AUC in the test set; 0.77, 0.60, p < 0.001).Conclusion: The combination of radiomics of non-contrast-enhanced T1 mapping and T1 values could provide higher diagnostic accuracy for MVO. Radiomics also provides incremental value in the prediction of LV longitudinal systolic myocardial contractility at six months."

Many graph embedding techniques attempt to represent the similarity of nodes in local subgraphs as the distance in vector space. Deep learning for real-world graph-structured data poses great challenges for the interpretation of the result, as the entangled information is induced by complex interactions of neighborhood nodes together with many latent factors. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a mutual information-based method to have a good performance on link prediction as well as to produce an interpretable subgraph for the link. Mutual information is used to find a subgraph that plays an important role in maximizing the similarity of two nodes and to give an explanation statistically. Our method effectively predicts the link by utilizing subgraphs based on the importance of the nodes and the edges for link prediction. At the same time, it gives a compact explanation for link prediction by mutual information."

Then, the number of successful speech recognition cases was measured on the basis of the speech uttered by three groups (i.e., native English speakers, Korean-English bilinguals, and EFL students). It showed that the chatbot found it difficult to recognize fast speech phenomena including Tapification and/or Contraction. Moreover, the chatbot recognized bilingual speakers' English pronunciation most accurately, followed by native English speakers and EFL students, which might be attributed to the ASR algorithm based on the spoken English as an International Language (EIL). An additional analysis employing the Praat revealed that this was due to the duration of speech and pauses and that this sophisticated technology did not appear to be fully functional in recognizing unstressed sounds with a low level of duration. Finally, the present study suggests some ideas for designing and utilizing chatbots to achieve a higher level of efficacy in TEFL."

DNN-Based Brain MRI Classification Using Fuzzy Clustering and Autoencoder Features,2021,"['Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'Fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering', 'Deep neural network', 'Autoencoder', 'Classification']",,"Worldwide interest has been noted in medical image analysis and classification using machine learning techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the safe and painless procedures for human brain scanning. During the MRI procedure, magnetic fields and radio waves are used to scan and map the extended view of brain tissues for further pathological processes and analysis. For a qualitative and quantitative MRI analysis, the manual capability of radiologists and/or doctors is limited and time-consuming in complex and group-level diagnoses. Hence, the development of an intelligent, robust, and reliable support system for the diagnosis of brain-related diseases is a top priority. In this paper, a new deep neural network based MRI image classification approach is proposed that uses fuzzy c-mean (FCM) and an autoencoder to classify brain MRI as normal or abnormal, diminishing human error during the diagnosis of diseases in MRI scans. Here, FCM is utilized for abnormal tissue segmentation from brain MRI images, followed by an autoencoder, for extraction and dimensionality reduction of features. Finally, a deep neural network was used for the classification of brain MRI images that were trained using FCM-extracted features and sample data. Considering the availability of raw MRI data, data augmentation techniques have also been used to increase the number of data required to train a deep neural network. The experiment results achieved 96% accuracy and a 95% sensitivity rate for classification. The results demonstrate that the proposed well-trained deep learning technology has the potential to make solid predictions regarding brain abnormalities; therefore, it can be used as a prominent tool in clinical practice."

In our proposed system, we first detect the faces of input images using YOLOv5 and classify them as the one of three scene complexity classes (Simple, Moderate, and Complex) based on the number of detected faces. After that, the image is fed into the Faster-RCNN with the one of three ResNet (ResNet-18, 50, and 101) as backbone network depending on the scene complexity for detecting the face area and identifying whether the person is wearing the mask properly or not. We evaluated our proposed system using public mask detection datasets. The results show that our proposed system outperforms other models."

Speaker overlap is when two or more speakers speak at the same time during a conversation, and can lead to performance degradation in the fields of speech recognition or speaker recognition, and a lot of research is being conducted because it can prevent performance degradation. Recently, as application of artificial intelligence is increasing, there is a demand for switching between artificial intelligence frameworks. However, when switching frameworks, performance degradation is observed due to the unique characteristics of each framework, making it difficult to switch frameworks. In this paper, the process of converting the speaker overlap detection system based on the Keras framework to the pytorch-based system is explained and considers components. As a result of the framework switching, the pytorch-based system showed better performance than the existing Keras-based speaker overlap detection system, so it can be said that it is valuable as a fundamental study on systematic framework conversion."

Studies that calculate and predict solar radiation without additional equipment are also insufficient. This study aims to predict power consumption of various buildings based on only meteorological data provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration. It is meaningful in that no additional devices are installed except for the power consumption data. Hourly solar radiation was derived using calculation formula. Accuracy was derived by applying meteorological data and calculated insolation as input data for predicting building power consumption. Solar radiation was derived with CVRMSE of 27.61%, MBE of -10.62%, and RMSE of 53.41 W/㎡ regarding the accuracy of calculated and measured data.

Recently, CF research using machine learning algorithms has been actively conducted, among which Autoencoder models have outstanding recommendation performances. Autoencoder models go through preprocessing to improve recommendation performance. However, traditional preprocessing used by current models cannot solve information loss due to dimensional reduction and restoration as well as uneven distribution of datasets. Therefore, in this work, we propose a preprocessing system suitable for user-based Autoencoder models. This work consists of filter modules and distribution modules, which sequentially reduce the problems of traditional preprocessing. We minimized the information loss problems in filter modules and the uneven distribution of datasets in distribution modules. We then conducted experiments comparing each module to conventional preprocessing to confirm the improved results. We also proved that recommendation performance increase when we train a user-based Autoencoder model with datasets that applied the suggested method through an experiment."
PM10 예측 성능 향상을 위한 이진 분류 모델 비교 분석,2021,,,"High forecast accuracy is required as social issues on particulate matter increase. Therefore, many attempts are being made using machine learning to increase the accuracy of particulate matter prediction. However, due to problems with the distribution of imbalance in the concentration and various characteristics of particulate matter, the learning of prediction models is not well done. In this paper, to solve these problems, a binary classification model was proposed to predict the concentration of particulate matter needed for prediction by dividing it into two classes based on the value of 80㎍/㎥. Four classification algorithms were utilized for the binary classification of PM10. Classification algorithms used logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, and MLP. As a result of performance evaluation through confusion matrix, the MLP model showed the highest binary classification performance with 89.98% accuracy among the four models."

Meta model (approximated function form) is constructed based on some samples and is improved in sequence by adding a few samples at a time. It has been observed that computational intelligence such as support vector regression(SVR) and radial basis function networks(RBFN) can be effectively applied to meta-modeling. The performance is affected by hyper-parameters, for example, Gaussian width and a regularization parameter. One of the most popular methods for estimating suitable/adequate hyper-parameters is the cross validation(CV) test. However, CV test is usually time consuming, and, may not be applicable for sequential approximation optimization with a small number of sample points. In this research, we suggest a sequential meta-learning method using bagging and boosting in order to reduce the burden on choosing the width of Gaussian function as well as to generate a good approximate model with as a small number of samples as possible. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated in terms of generalization ability and control of parameter through numerical experiments."

Most depression-related data mining and machine learning studies have been conducted to predict the presence of depression or to derive individual risk factors. However, since depression is caused by a combination of various factors, it is necessary to identify the complex relationship between the factors in order to establish effective anti-depression and management measures. In this study, we propose a methodology for identifying and interpreting patterns of depression expressions using the method of deriving random forest rules, where the random forest rule consists of the condition for the manifestation of the depressive pattern and the prediction result of depression when the condition is met. The analysis was carried out by subdividing into 4 groups in consideration of the different depressive patterns according to gender and age. Depression rules derived by the proposed methodology were validated by comparing them with the results of previous studies. Also, through the AUC comparison test, the depression diagnosis performance of the derived rules was evaluated, and it was not different from the performance of the existing PHQ-9 summing method. The significance of this study can be found in that it enabled the interpretation of the complex relationship between depressive factors beyond the existing studies that focused on prediction and deduction of major factors."

The worst flood situation in urban area can be occurred with difficulties of structural measures such as river levees, discharge capacity of urban sewage, storage basin of storm water, and pump facilities. However, identifying in advance the spatial flood information can have a decisive effect on minimizing flood damage. Therefore, this study presents a methodology that can predict the urban flood map in real-time by using rainfall data of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), the results of two-dimensional flood analysis and random forest (RF) regression model. The Ujeong district in Ulsan metropolitan city, which the flood is frequently occurred, was selected for the study area. The RF regression model predicted the flood map corresponding to the 50 mm, 80 mm, and 110 mm rainfall events with 6-hours duration. And, the predicted results showed 63%, 80%, and 67% goodness of fit compared to the results of two-dimensional flood analysis model. It is judged that the suggested results of this study can be utilized as basic data for evacuation and response to urban flooding that occurs suddenly."

A lab-scale experiment was designed to produce fault datasets (time-series electric current measurements) for 10 failure modes of the air compressor. The results demonstrated that the temporal pattern of the datasets showed periodicity with a different period, depending on the failure mode. An AD model with a convolutional autoencoder was developed and trained based on a normal operation dataset. The reconstruction error was used as the threshold for AD. The reconstruction error was noted to be dependent on the AD model and hyperparameter tuning. The AD model was applied to the synthetic dataset, which comprised both normal and abnormal conditions of the air compressor for validation. The AD model exhibited good detection performance on anomalies showing periodicity but poor performance on anomalies resulting from subtle load changes in the motor."

Automatic modulation classification of noise‐like radar intrapulse signals using cascade classifier,2021,"['complex envelope', 'convolutional neural network', 'modulation classification', 'radar emitter identification']",,"Automatic modulation classification is essential in radar emitter identification. We propose a cascade classifier by combining a support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), considering that noise might be taken as radar signals. First, the SVM distinguishes noise signals by the main ridge slice feature of signals. Second, the complex envelope features of the predicted radar signals are extracted and placed into a designed CNN, where a modulation classification task is performed. Simulation results show that the SVM‐CNN can effectively distinguish radar signals from noise. The overall probability of successful recognition (PSR) of modulation is 98.52% at 20 dB and 82.27% at −2 dB with low computation costs. Furthermore, we found that the accuracy of intermediate frequency estimation significantly affects the PSR. This study shows the possibility of training a classifier using complex envelope features. What the proposed CNN has learned can be interpreted as an equivalent matched filter consisting of a series of small filters that can provide different responses determined by envelope features."

Currently, large corporations and several countries are making large-scale investments, seeing AI technology as the core of their industrial competitiveness. There is no limit to the field of use of artificial intelligence, and its capabilities are expected to be endless in the future. Based on the impact of AI on the game of Go, we can predict the future impact of the development of artificial intelligence on society and communities. First, even if artificial intelligence develops, the current social system is not expected to be greatly affected for the time being. Because artificial intelligence is a machine, it is a tool that can be used by humans and is not a competitor to humans. Second, the computational power of artificial intelligence affects the technological development of Baduk. Third, the development of artificial intelligence requires a new code of conduct. Because Go players are tempted to win the game by using artificial intelligence without their opponents knowledge, policies to properly prevent and control this are necessary. In this article, the necessity, legal structure, and important issues related to the regulation of artificial intelligence are reviewed. Artificial intelligence has a great impact in that it replaces human cognitive and computational abilities by machines, and in that the development of artificial intelligence technology and its application fields are rapidly spread along with the development of science and technology. The role of administration is important to increase the usefulness of artificial intelligence and reduce potential harm. The administration should also function as a facilitator for the development of artificial intelligence technology, but there should be no shortages in its activity as a monitor to prevent infringement on the rights and interests of the people. As for laws related to artificial intelligence, autonomous laws centered on large corporations are important, and national regulations also have a larger space for use of soft laws such as guidelines rather than acts. Algorithms, which are the methods of operation of artificial intelligence, are based on their own rules. The codes that organize them are similar to laws, but because of their concealed nature and anonymity, they are different from national laws formed by congressional procedures and promulgated to the public. Care should be taken to ensure that ruled by law is not ruled by code. The administration has already carried out a significant part of the investigation, diagnosis and regulation using artificial intelligence in the areas of road traffic, taxation, punishment, education and health, and it is expected that there will be more and more applications of artificial intelligence in the future. The protection of privacy and non-discrimination are required and monitored by the state against large AI companies. However, when the state directly uses artificial intelligence to conduct administration, care must be taken not to infringe on the rights and interests of the people themselves. When the number of tasks and disputes related to artificial intelligence increase, a national organization that is responsible for dealing with them should be established. The 4th Industrial Revolution Committee, which is currently organized, focuses on the development and application of artificial intelligence, so it is evaluated that it is not enough as an institution for regulation such as protecting the basic rights of the people and ensuring transparency of algorithms. In the future, an independent and efficient agency on artificial intelligence should be established in Korea."

The China’s warfighting concept pertaining to system confrontations and the USA’s warfighting concept to systems warfare analyze a military entity as system of systems and they try to protect their systems and destroy opposing systems. The former is based on the NCW concept to actualize its concept for victory, the system destruction warfare. The latter is based on the decision-centric warfare theory and created the mosaic warfare theory to actualize it. Also, this essay asserts that all of them pursue the algorithmic warfare using AI. It strongly insists that the algorithmic warfare is inevitable in the near future. Because big data means larger and more complex data sets and data sets are very important to AI/ML(machine learning), it enunciates that the Korea military must prioritize making data sets in each field and sector in order to develop relevant AI. Also, it suggests that Korea military needs to shift a threat analysis from the order of battle one to system of systems one and have very transformable organizations. In this perspective, if the Korea military uses AI capabilities properly, it can decide more fast than the opposing systems and transform military organizations into very improvisatory and adaptable forms based on situational changes. However, in the AI algorithmic warfare, it argues that the nature of war as political means will be relevant, the human will to fight be critical, and the fog and frictions in war exist. It concludes that disregarding the nature of war, any military organizations face a danger."

Recently, various attempts have been made to utilize agricultural solar power generation. Agricultural photovoltaic power generation has a disadvantage in that maintenance is relatively difficult because it is installed on a relatively high structure unlike conventional photovoltaic power generation. To solve these problems, intelligent and efficient operation and diagnostic functions are required. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a prediction and diagnosis system to collect and store the power output of agricultural solar power generation facilities and implement an intelligent prediction model. The proposed system predicts the amount of power generation based on the amount of solar power generation and environmental sensor data, determines whether there is an abnormality in the facility, calculates the aging degree of the facility and provides it to the user."

This nature of the job has always required intricate systems manufactured using an expensive set of sensors and components. In this paper, we propose a system to draw the trajectory of a golf ball during a drive. The proposed system combines the classical computer vision techniques and a modern deep neural network to project the trajectories over videos taken from monocular cameras. Before starting to track the ball, the system uses YOLO(You Only Look Once) V3, deep neural network model to perform localization of the golf ball and the player. To track the initial point of impact between the club and the ball the system uses Hough transform. Finally to track the ball, the system extracts motion information of the video by using frame differencing. Unto the information received from frame differencing, the system applies filters based on a few assumptions, size and direction of movement to obtain the detections of the golf ball. The proposed system was tested on a multitude of videos to verify its effectiveness and the respective results are presented."

As the nature of the cloud is distributed and dynamic, the jeopardies present in the current implementations of virtualization, numerous security threats and attacks have been reported. Considering the potent architecture and the system complexity, it is indispensable to adopt fundamentals. This paper proposes a secure authentication and data sharing scheme for providing security to the cloud data. An efficient IPSO-KELM is proposed for detecting the malicious behaviour of the user. Initially, the proposed method starts with the authentication phase of the data sender. After authentication, the sender sends the data to the cloud, and the IPSO-KELM identifies if the received data from the sender is an attacked one or normal data i.e. the algorithm identifies if the data is received from a malicious sender or authenticated sender. If the data received from the sender is identified to be normal data, then the data is securely shared with the data receiver using SHA256-RSA algorithm. The upshot of the proposed method are scrutinized by identifying the dissimilarities with the other existing techniques to confirm that the proposed IPSO-KELM and SHA256-RSA works well for malicious user detection and secure data sharing in the cloud."

In this study, we employ an elastic net-based feature selection which is one of the embedded methods and demonstrate the utility of which by analyzing the results. Using the fNIRS dataset obtained from 18 participants for classifying brain activation induced by mental arithmetic and idle state, we calculated classification accuracies after performing feature selection while changing the parameter α (weight of lasso vs. ridge regularization). Grand averages of classification accuracy are 80.0 ± 9.4%, 79.3 ± 9.6%, 79.0 ± 9.2%, 79.7 ± 10.1%, 77.6 ± 10.3%, 79.2 ± 8.9%, and 80.0 ± 7.8% for the various values of α = 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5, respectively, and are not statistically different from the grand average of classification accuracy estimated with all features (80.1 ± 9.5%). As a result, no difference in classification accuracy is revealed for all considered parameter α values. Especially for α = 0.5, we are able to achieve the statistically same level of classification accuracy with even 16.4% features of the total features. Since elastic net-based feature selection can be easily applied to other cases without complicated initialization and parameter fine-tuning, we can be looking forward to seeing that the elastic-based feature selection can be actively applied to fNIRS data."

Runoff occurs by reaction of a watershed to the rainfall and has non-linearity and uncertainty due to the complex relation of weather and watershed factors. ANN (Artificial Neural Network), which learns from the data, is one of the machine learning technique known as a proper model to interpret non-linear data. The performance of ANN is affected by the ANN’s structure, the number of hidden layer nodes, learning rate, and activation function. Especially, the activation function has a role to deliver the information entered and decides the way of making output. Therefore, It is important to apply appropriate activation functions according to the problem to solve. In this paper, ANN models were constructed to estimate runoff with different activation functions and each model was compared and evaluated. Sigmoid, Hyperbolic tangent, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), ELU (Exponential Linear Unit) functions were applied to the hidden layer, and Identity, ReLU, Softplus functions applied to the output layer.

센서 데이터 변곡점에 따른 Time Segmentation 기반 항공기 엔진의 고장 패턴 추출,2021,"['Fault Detection', 'Time Segmentation', 'Signal Discretization', 'Inflection Point', 'Sensor Data']",,"As mechatronic systems have various, complex functions and require high performance, automatic fault detection is necessary for secure operation in manufacturing processes. For conducting automatic and real-time fault detection in modern mechatronic systems, multiple sensor signals are collected by internet of things technologies. Since traditional statistical control charts or machine learning approaches show significant results with unified and solid density models under normal operating states but they have limitations with scattered signal models under normal states, many pattern extraction and matching approaches have been paid attention. Signal discretization-based pattern extraction methods are one of popular signal analyses, which reduce the size of the given datasets as much as possible as well as highlight significant and inherent signal behaviors. Since general pattern extraction methods are usually conducted with a fixed size of time segmentation, they can easily cut off significant behaviors, and consequently the performance of the extracted fault patterns will be reduced. In this regard, adjustable time segmentation is proposed to extract much meaningful fault patterns in multiple sensor signals. By considering inflection points of signals, we determine the optimal cut-points of time segments in each sensor signal. In addition, to clarify the inflection points, we apply Savitzky-golay filter to the original datasets. To validate and verify the performance of the proposed segmentation, the dataset collected from an aircraft engine (provided by NASA prognostics center) is used to fault pattern extraction. As a result, the proposed adjustable time segmentation shows better performance in fault pattern extraction."

In particular, trailing edge noise is a major noise source. A number of results using complex predictive models with machine learning techniques and artificial neural network have been reported, and the results are generally good, depending on the application. However, the rigorous verification of the model itself that produces such predictive results is very insufficient, and there is a lack of understanding of the process in which the results are produced, and an explanation of the various physical phenomena observed in the experiment is not easy. In this study, Brooks, Pope, and Marcolini (BPM) model, the most popular semi-empirical model for airfoil noise prediction, was subjected to an analysis using multilevel modeling. The multilevel model is a statistical model containing both fixed effects and random effects. We were able to reckon the interpretation of two issues that are left unexplained in BPM model and to improve our understanding of the noise phenomenon of wind turbines.

INSTABILITY OF THE BETTI SEQUENCE FOR PERSISTENT HOMOLOGY AND A STABILIZED VERSION OF THE BETTI SEQUENCE,2021,"['Topological data analysis', 'Persistence homology', 'Vectorization', 'Stability', 'Betti sequence.']",,"Topological Data Analysis (TDA), a relatively new ﬁeld of data analysis, has proved very useful in a variety of applications. The main persistence tool from TDA is persis- tent homology in which data structure is examined at many scales. Representations of persis- tent homology include persistence barcodes and persistence diagrams, both of which are not straightforward to reconcile with traditional machine learning algorithms as they are sets of intervals or multisets. The problem of faithfully representing barcodes and persistent diagrams has been pursued along two main avenues: kernel methods and vectorizations. One vectoriza- tion is the Betti sequence, or Betti curve, derived from the persistence barcode. While the Betti sequence has been used in classiﬁcation problems in various applications, to our knowledge, the stability of the sequence has never before been discussed. In this paper we show that the Betti sequence is unstable under the 1-Wasserstein metric with regards to small perturbations in the barcode from which it is calculated. In addition, we propose a novel stabilized version of the Betti sequence based on the Gaussian smoothing seen in the Stable Persistence Bag of Words for persistent homology. We then introduce the normalized cumulative Betti sequence and provide numerical examples that support the main statement of the paper."

A defining feature of CAT stems from its item selection algorithms, among which both research interest and practical applications of decision-tree based CAT (DT-based CAT) have been rising recently. In the field of machine learning, however, it is well known that decision-trees, as a form of predictive models with simple and interpretable tree structures, can be vulnerable to the problem of overfitting or the problem of creating overly complex trees that do not generalize to newly observed data. Among various ensemble techniques developed to adequately address this problem, we the authors paid attention to the Alternating Model Tree (AMT) due to its interpretable tree-like structure. The purpose of this article is to investigate the viability of the Alternating Model Tree (AMT) as an item selection algorithm for constructing CAT. To this end, we first presented a detailed exposition of how AMT-based CAT can be constructed and then compared its performance with DT-based CAT using two sets of publicly available psychological test scores. The results provided supportive evidence that AMT-based CAT is viable, and that AMT-based CAT can predict test scores at least as accurate as DT-based CAT does. Based on our findings, we discuss implications, limitations, and directions of future studies."
Strip Crown Prediction in Hot Rolling Process Using Random Forest,2021,['Hot rolling · Strip crown · Ensemble method · Random forest'],,"This paper established a model based on an ensemble method to predict strip crown using 230,000 coils of data obtained from a hot rolling line. Before modeling, a specific method was proposed to reduce noise and remove outliers, and a new dataset of 5657 samples was generated. Parameter tuning considering mean squared error (MSE) was carried out to establish three machine learning models including support vector machine (SVC), regression tree (RT), and random forest (RF). Determination coefficient (R 2 ), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were used as indicators to evaluate the prediction of models. Results showed that the RF had the best performance with the highest R 2 of 0.707, as well as the lowest RMSE of 5.66 μm. Moreover, an additional method that repeated the three models 100 times was developed, and box plots were used to visualize the distribution of R 2 , MAE and RMSE. RF can correct for decision trees to reduce overfitting to their training set, improving the generalization, and in this paper, the trained RF which had stable performance is considered as the most recommended model. After that, for RF, rankings of rolling process variable were validated to make a comparison with the existing physical understanding"

Although experts use a security system such as intrusion detection systems, the existing intrusion systems have low detection accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a machine learning model for more accurate intrusion detections of devices in edge computing. The proposed model is a hybrid model that combines a stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract important feature vectors from the input data using sparsity constraints. To find the optimal model, we compared and analyzed the performance as adjusting the sparsity coefficient of SSAE. As a result, the model showed the highest accuracy as a 96.9% using the sparsity constraints. Therefore, the model showed the highest performance when model trains only important features."

Based on this, we determined the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each of these components. AUC analysis identified 10 features which could be consistently applied to distinguish between all KNCs and WSB chickens in both breast (0.988) and thigh (1.000) meat without error. Here, both 1H NMR and 2D NMR could successfully quantify various target metabolites which could be used to distinguish between different chicken breeds based on their metabolic profile."

"Investigating the capabilities of multispectral remote sensors data to map alteration zones in the Abhar area, NW Iran",2021,"['Abhar', 'alteration zones', 'Sentinel-2', 'ASTER', 'SVM', 'ANN']",,"Economic mineralization is often associated with alterations that are identifiable by remote sensing coupled geological analysis. The present paper aims to investigate the capabilities of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data to map iron oxide and hydrothermally alteration zones in the Abhar area, NW Iran. To achieve this goal, the principal component analysis (PCA) and two machine learning methods including support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed. PCA method was carried out on four bands of all data and then the appropriate principal components were selected to map alterations. Due to the high precision of ASTER data within the short-wave infrared range, these data results are more satisfactory compared with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensors in detecting hydrothermally alterations through the PCA technique. Based on the obtained maps, the performance of all data types was approximately similar in the detection of iron oxide zones. Our desired data were classified by two methods of SVM and ANN. The results of these algorithms were presented as confusion matrix. According to these results, for hydrothermally alterations, ASTER data showed better performance in both SVM and ANN than other datasets by gaining values greater than 90%. These data did not perform well in the iron oxide zones detection, while Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 have been more successful. For iron oxide, based on confusion matrix, Landsat-8 data have obtained the values of 78% and 79% through SVM and ANN algorithms, respectively, and also Sentinel-2 has acquired the values of 88.11% and 90.55% via SVM and ANN, respectively. Therefore, to map iron oxide zones, Sentinel-2 data are more favorable than Landsat-8 data. In addition, the ANN algorithm in ASTER data has represented the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient with the values of 88.73% and 0.8453, respectively."
Consultation Management Model based on Behavior Classification of Special-Needs Students,2021,,,"Unlike behaviors that are generally known, information regarding unspecific behaviors is insufficient. For an education or guidance regarding the unspecific behaviors, collection and management of data regarding the unspecific behaviors of special-needs students are needed. In this paper, a consultation management model based on behavior classification of special-needs students using machine learning is proposed. It collects data by photographing the behavior of special students in real time, analyzes the behavior pattern, composes a data set, and trains it in the suggestion system. It is possible to improve the accuracy by comparing the behavior of special students photographed later into the suggestion system and analyzing the results by comparing it with the existing data again.

Modeling Individual Differences in Driver Workload Inference Using Physiological Data,2021,"['Real-traffic experiment', 'Cognitive response', 'Electrocardiogram (ECG)', 'Electroencephalogram (EEG)', 'Fuzzy clustering']",,"Inferring driver workload has started to draw greater attention with the emerging automotive technology of higher autonomy. In this paper, we revisited the popular assumption of fixed workload levels determined by the driving environment, and propose a framework to generate a Personalized Driver Workload Profile (PDWP) that incorporates individual differences. A rich set of physiological and operational data from a real-traffic Electric Vehicle (EV) driving experiment was utilized. Physiological features were generated and selected from forty drivers’ electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using multiple signal processing and machine learning techniques. A PDWP is defined as a random variable with three possible workload levels, and conditional distributions of the PDWP of the rest period and four driving environments were generated using fuzzy c-means clustering. The results revealed there exists little resemblance among the PDWPs of individual drivers, even in an identical driving environment. Moreover, some drivers exhibited strong evidence of EV range stress, but such phenomena were not universal. Our study is the first attempt to incorporate individual differences in estimating driving workload based on the direct cognitive responses using physiological data collected in a realtraffic experiment."
Preoperative hyperlactatemia and early mortality after liver transplantation: selection of important variables using random forest survival analysis,2021,"['Early mortality', 'Lactate', 'Liver transplantation', 'Random survival.']",,"Background: Generally, lactate levels > 2 mmol/L represent hyperlactatemia, whereas lactic acidosis is often defined as lactate > 4 mmol/L. Although hyperlactatemia is common finding in liver transplant (LT) candidates, association between lactate and organ failures with Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) is poorly studied. We searched the important variables for pre-LT hyperlactatemia and examined the impact of preoperative hyperlactatemia on early mortality after LT. Methods: A total of 2,002 patients from LT registry between January 2008 and February 2019 were analyzed. Six organ failures (liver, kidney, brain, coagulation, circulation, and lung) were defined by criteria of EASL-CLIF ACLF Consortium. Variable importance of preoperative hyperlactatemia was examined by machine learning using random survival forest (RSF). Kaplan-Meier Survival curve analysis was performed to assess 90-day mortality.Results: Median lactate level was 1.9 mmol/L (interquartile range: 1.4, 2.4 mmol/L) and 107 (5.3%) patients showed > 4.0 mmol/L. RSF analysis revealed that the four most important variables for hyperlactatemia were MELD score, circulatory failure, hemoglobin, and respiratory failure. The 30-day and 90-day mortality rates were 2.7% and 5.1%, whereas patients with lactate > 4.0 mmol/L showed increased rate of 15.0% and 19.6%, respectively. Conclusion: About 50% and 5% of LT candidates showed pre-LT hyperlactatemia of > 2.0 mmol/L and > 4.0 mmol/L, respectively. Pre-LT lactate > 4.0 mmol/L was associated with increased early post-LT mortality. Our results suggest that future study of correcting modifiable risk factors may play a role in preventing hyperlactatemia and lowering early mortality after LT."

Although the current weather forecast provides quantitative rainfall, there are several difficulties in predicting the extent of damage. Therefore, in order to understand the impact of damage, the threshold rainfall for each watershed is required. The damage caused by rainfall occurs differently by region, and there are limitations in the analysis considering the characteristic factors of each watershed. In addition, whenever rainfall comes, the analysis of rainfall-runoff through the hydrological model consumes a lot of time and is often analyzed using only simple rainfall data. This study used GIS data and calculated the threshold rainfall from the threshold runoff causing flooding by coupling two hydrologic models. The calculation result was verified by comparing it with the actual case, and it was analyzed that damage occurred in the dangerous area in general.

"On the optimization of building energy, material, and economic management using soft computing",2021,"['sustainability', 'building energy optimization', 'economic management', 'soft computing']",,"This paper provides energy and economic analysis relevant to the cooling season in building enclosures. For a whole year, an Energy Plus thermal transfer model has been created and simulated. Simulations were made from the cities in five different areas of climate in China using weather data files. Energy savings were done from natural cold (e.g., outdoor air), and electricity reductions were performed from air-conditioning electricity devices. This research has investigated the relationship between the cost and building energy while finding a strong and positive correlation. This study has used the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) to calculate the accurate measurement. Three regression models as Pearson correlation coefficient (r), root mean square (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) was used to calculate the results. Following the results of (R<sup>2</sup>) and RMSE, ELM has shown its higher performance in predicting the strength, energy, and cost of building materials. Based on the simulation results, for office buildings situated in cold areas, the energy savings resulting from phase change materials (PCM) are more prevalent. The test findings demonstrate that the energy savings from PCM applications for the cool area and hot summers and cold winter office buildings were increased. Simple payback time indicated that PCMBs in inhabited buildings could be used cost-effectively in a mild temperature environment."

Numerical simulation was carried out using the Van der Meer equation and Level III reliability design method based on the Monte Carlo simulation. In doing so, modified Glukhovskiy wave height distribution and situ wave height data collected at Ulleungdo from January 1, 1979-December 31, 2019 were used. Tri-modal Gaissuian wave slope distribution was also used, which showed good agreements with situ wave data collected at Mangbang from April 26, 2017, to April 20, 2018. The probability coefficients of tri-modal Gaussian distribution were estimated using Matlab-based statistics and machine learning toolbox, MLE [Maximum Likelihood Estimates]. In the numerical simulation, the intrinsic limitations of Gaussian distribution were revealed, such as imposing a non-negligible probability mass even in the negative wave slope, under-shooting in longer and shorter waves, and over-shooting in mid-scale waves. In the case of failure probability of an armoring rock, Gaussian distribution was shown to give underestimated failure probability. The extent of underestimation was more considerable at Mangbang, where a tidal terrace of lower depth and gently varying slope was developed than at Ulleungdo. These differences were triggered by the presence of probability plateau formed in wave slope distribution whenever infra-gravity waves appear in random wave packet due to the resonant wave-wave interaction. Therefore, it can be easily conceivable that probability plateau has a significant effect on the armoring rock failure probability. Therefore, PIANC s recommendation that wave slope follows Gaussian distribution needs to be amended. Moreover, the reliability-based design of breakwater should be implemented based on tri-modal Gaussian wave slope distribution, which can accurately reproduce probability plateau."

Previous studies used hydrological and climate data simultaneously as input data of the learning process. Further, they excluded linear trends in input data and GRACE/GFO data because the trend components obtained from GRACE/GFO data were assumed to be the same for other periods. However, hydrological models include high uncertainties, and observational period of GRACE/GFO is not long enough to estimate reliable TWS trends. In this study, we used convolutional neural networks (CNN) method incorporating only climate data set (temperature, evaporation, and precipitation) to predict TWS variations in the missing period of GRACE/GFO. We also make CNN model learn the linear trend of GRACE/GFO data. In most river basins considered in this study, our CNN model successfully predicts seasonal and long-term variations of TWS change."

However, most sports organizations do not properly grasp the importance of crisis communication. For effective crisis communication, preparation for the crisis is necessary, and in this regard, the recent crisis of Corona 19 is a crisis that sports organizations must prepare for. Therefore, this study compared and analyzed the media response messages of KBO and K-League officials in the case of Corona 19 Positive Athletes in the League. Text data of 163 articles in 26 media were analyzed using big data analysis techniques such as web scraping through Python programming and Bayesian filter among machine learning algorithms. Through this study, KBO showed an open attitude that the secretary general, who is the general manager of the organization, promptly proceeded to direct media interviews from the beginning of the situation, but it was not effective because of a consistent and unified message. KBO should collect as much information as possible at the beginning of the crisis, but it was insufficient. In addition, the KBO's crisis stage and federation's post crisis stage response allowed us to infer that corrective action, justification, and ingratiation strategies could be effective if the organization's past history and crisis responsibility were low. This study provides valuable academic and practical implications for the post-corona era in that it dealt with effective crisis communication in the context of the COVID-19 situation."

Photo- based simulacrum has been continuously produced from analog printing or photomontage to digital compositing. The production of the analog simulacrum required sophisticated manual labor and skill, as well as an accurate understanding of the photochemical principle of photography. Since then, with the spread of digital technology, the production of simulacrums has become much easier. By using digital tools, easy and sophisticated operation became possible. With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence algorithms, the production of simulacrum takes another leap forward. GAN is an algorithm that calculates similar data based on learning data, and is a generative model optimized for the production of simulacrum. GAN is opening a new dimension of simulacrum by continuously growing and conquering new tasks. This means that the eyes of artificial intelligence-based machines are once again expanding the human vision."

Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) was standardized by 3GPP, aiming to deliver data services through unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum. Furthermore, the 3GPP proposed 5G New Radio-Unlicensed (NR-U) study item. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted enormous attention to implement 5G and beyond systems, which is known as Intelligent Radio (IR). To tackle the challenges of unlicensed spectrum networks in 4G/5G/B5G systems, a lot of works have been done, focusing on using Machine Learning (ML) to support resource allocation in LTE-LAA/NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence environments. Generally speaking, ML techniques are used in IR based on statistical models established for solving specific optimization problems. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive survey on the recent research efforts related to unlicensed cellular networks and IR technologies, which work jointly to implement 5G and beyond wireless networks. Furthermore, we introduce a positioning assisted LTE-LAA system based on the difference in received signal strength (DRSS) to allocate resources among UEs.

Advances in information processing are commonly used to quantify gigantic building activity data steps to boost the activity efficiency of the building energy systems. Here, some smart data mining models are offered to measure, and predict the time series for energy in order to expose different ephemeral principles for using energy. Such considerations illustrate the use of machines in relation to time, such as day hour, time of day, week, month and year relationships within a family unit, which are key components in gathering and separating the effect of consumers behaviors in the use of energy and their pattern of energy prediction. It is necessary to determine the multiple relations through the usage of different appliances from simultaneous information flows. In comparison, specific relations among interval-based instances where multiple appliances use continue for certain duration are difficult to determine. In order to resolve these difficulties, an unsupervised energy time-series data clustering and a frequent pattern mining study as well as a deep learning technique for estimating energy use were presented. A broad test using true data sets that are rich in smart meter data were conducted.

And science takes, for example, mathematics, quantum approaches, or encryption technology, as well as various challenges arising from social science problems such as identity, privacy, and the impact of machine learning on individuals and society as a mode of progress. The development and commercialization of a new financial business model, combined with disruptive innovation, is called FinTech. However, how the government and industry-university respond to it will become particularly important in evaluating the future of the UK’s financial sector.The government is aiming to ensure that the UK is firmly positioned as a global leader in Fin Tech, and is already making great strides toward this goal. As part of this policy, Rt Hon. George Osborne has commissioned me to report on the future of FinTech and write recommendations for how science can most effectively contribute to FinTech.This paper provides a long-term vision for the UK's FinTech sector, building on the government’s work to date. The Recommendation seeks to lay a solid foundation for supporting and facilitating growth in this sector for 2025. In particular, I will give an example of how governments, regulators, and industry and academia must work closely together to proceed in an innovative way. As with any technology, FinTech itself is neither good nor bad. It can be good or bad depending on the usage of the technique. It has already been shown that FinTech fundamentally changes existing business models. This creates a great opportunity to develop and report better business and user services, potentially paving the way for people currently unable to access financial services. However, this possibility should not be taken for granted.FinTech has a lot of potential to offer new ways to scam and exploit businesses and users, and if not done properly, it could increase the marginalization of financial services (financial exclusion). It is important for governments and regulators to keep an eye on this emerging sector."

However, we can speculate what will be necessary in the future when considering the weaknesses in the early stages of AI. In the era of materialism, human virtues are worthlessly discarded, which leads to the degradation of human values. Therefore, we need an image of a human being that creates a humanity where human nature is recovered. As there are no children without parents, we should not have communication problems and always be honest, extending every courtesy by recovering good nature through filial duty (孝) remaining a permanent truth.Additionally, emotional human-touch will be paradoxically missed by people during the era of AI that is equipped with convenience and rapidity. The most one that we say to AI ‘Genie’ as a product of untact era is ‘Genie, I love you’, and we can guess what people may want from this. Work efficiency is improved by celebrating various anniversaries through emotional management in the workplace that is perceived as a base. As AI improves, humans will continue to thirst for sympathy and physical contact.

K-평균 군집화를 통해 전체 민원은 민원 주제에 따라 10개의 군집으로 분류되었다. 분류된 군집별로 정서 분석을 시행한 결과, 군집 내 민원의 주제에 따라 주요 정서가 다르게 나타났다. 이러한 분석을 바탕으로 인천 시민들이 인천시에 바라는 바를 확인할 수 있었다. 나아가 실제 현장에서 업무 효율을 개선할 수 있는 방안인 도배성 민원 방지와 정서 노동 예방 등을 제언하였다.  본 연구는 텍스트 분석 기법을 이용하여 민원 데이터를 분석할 수 있다는 것을 잘 보여주고 있다. 그러나 민원의 본문을 수집하지 못해 제목만으로 분석했다는 한계가 있었다. 따라서 후속 연구에서는 민원 제목뿐 아니라 본문까지 분석에 포함할 수 있다면 이러한 한계를 극복할 수 있을 것이다.","This study performed in-depth analyses of civil petition data of Incheon City to investigate Incheon citizens’ public concerns and demands in the city.  Civil petition data were electronically collected from e-People and analyzed using machine learning and deep learning techniques such as word embedding, K-means clustering, and emotional analysis.  Entire civil petitions were classified into 10 clusters using K-means clustering according to the complaint topic. As a result of the emotional analysis for each classified cluster, the main emotions were found to be different according to the topic of civil complaints within the cluster. Based on these analyses, it was possible to confirm what Incheon citizens wanted from Incheon City. Furthermore, we suggested policies to improve work efficiency in the field, a method to prevent spams, and emotional labor.  Our study demonstrates how text analysis techniques can be applied to investigate citizens’ opinions and emotions about the city government. Although the study has the limitation of using only the title information of the text, it still provides rich information about people’s petitions."

Methods To this end, 10 special teachers working at Chungcheongnam-do public elementary school, 10 general education teachers who coached students subject to special education for more than two semesters, and two elementary school principals with more than 10 years of experience in special education were selected. And I did a qualitative research by conducting interviews with them for eight weeks. Results The result is as follows: First, special and integrated education teachers attempted strong motivation and official cooperation for the educational needs of students with disabilities. However, they almost copied the curriculum of predecessors. It also showed that the instructional modification of integrated education curriculum will not be effective in the integrated education environment. Next, the instructional modification provided by the government is not properly utilized in the integrated education field. So they strongly argued that a separate program was needed to solve this. Finally, even with the decrease in the number of students, the instructional modification of the curriculum of the content subjects for students with disabilities was not done efficiently. Conclusions Therefore, we should stop the research of improving teacher cooperation and formal instructional modification that we have focused on so far. And I suggest that instructional modification study should be conducted closely with the special education class. I also propose to introduce a machine learning program to special education students. In the future, it will be necessary to study why subjects other than Korean and math are not operated efficiently in integrated education environment."

Until now, the level of AI technology was at the level of support for decision-making, but now it will play a role as a decision-making system, resulting in a responsibility that only humans have borne.It is also an attempt to minimize these concerns by proposing several ethical principles for implementing accountability related to algorithms. There are clearly limitations that algorithms have to overcome in order to cope with these various problems. In order to solve these problems, a clear and transparent understanding of the algorithm must first be premised. Despite the many advantages of the algorithm, if it is impossible to predict unpredictability, error in pattern recognition, inability to explain the operation process of machine learning, and it is impossible to grasp a convincing discrimination criterion, many restrictions are inevitably applied to its use. Therefore, I believe that there is a need for guidelines to increase the transparency of the algorithm and to take measures to take legal and normative responses by establishing various standards.Through policies that ensure transparency, I believe that better understanding of AI technology and regulations based on that understanding will eventually be found. Although fewer than humans, artificial intelligence also makes mistakes, so I believe that appropriate regulations can be developed only by publicly knowing why such mistakes occur.In the end, it is necessary to optimize the algorithm to explain meaningful inferences or plans for the results presented by artificial intelligence, and I believe that such algorithm regulation is possible through transparency. In addition, in order to effectively manage and regulate artificial intelligence, transparency must be ensured throughout the entire process, from the algorithm production stage to countermeasures and disposal when a problem occurs. In order to legalize and standardize artificial intelligence regulations based on transparency and apply them, it is also a question of how much disclosure, explanation, or fairness and robustness can be judged as having transparency."

Data were generated to emulate a real educational large-scale data in varying degrees of intraclass correlation. Specifically, glmmLasso, a penalized regression algorithm to consider the multilevel data structure in variable selection, was compared to LASSO and elastic net with regard to prediction and variable selection. As a result, glmmLasso outperformed the other methods in terms of prediction, which magnified with increasing ICC values. While glmmLasso was superior to the other methods in selecting true level-2 predictors, it also tended to select many false level-1 predictors. When it is important to establish models of high prediction and identify level-2 predictors, glmmLasso can be preferred to the other methods. An empirical data analysis was also conducted to illustrate the applicability of the simulation study. In particular, TALIS 2018 variables to predict teacher cooperation were explored via the three penalized regression techniques. Based on the results of both studies, suggestions for future research are discussed."
Approach and application to transfer heterogeneous simulation data from finite element analysis to neural networks,2021,"[': plausibility check', 'finite element simulation', 'spherical detector surface', 'deep neural network', 'convolutional neural network', 'simulation DNA']",,"The simulation of product behavior is a vital part of current virtual product development. It can be expected that soon there will be more product simulations due to the availability of easy-to-use finite element analysis software and computational power. Consequently, the amount of accessible new simulation data adds up to the already existing amount. However, even when using easy-to-use finite element software tools, errors can occur during the setup of finite element simulations, and users should be warned about certain mistakes by automatic algorithms. To use the vast amount of available finite element simulations for a data-driven finite element support tool, in this paper, a methodology will be presented to transform different finite element simulations to unified matrices. The procedure is based on the projection of nodes onto a detector sphere, which is converted into a matrix in the next step. The generated matrices represent the simulation and can be described as the DNA of a finite element simulation. They can be used as an input for any machine learning model, such as convolutional neural networks. The essential steps of preprocessing the data and an application with a large dataset are part of this contribution. The trained network can then be used for an automatic plausibility check for new simulations, based on the previous simulation data from the past. This can result in a tool for automatic plausibility checks and can be the backbone for a feedback system for less experienced users."

Korean, however, presents some of the sentence-final suffixes to be exploited for identifying sentiment. Those suffixes mark honorification which are interpreted as lowered or raised speech depending on their type. This research has referred them as Sentiment-Triggering Suffixes (STSs) and extracted them from a large sentiment corpus, utilizing Chi-square test and Association rules. A series of experiments has proved that using STSs as a feature is effective in detecting sentiment particularly when a sentence is short in length and does not contain a sentiment-bearing word. In addition, better results have been derived when STSs imposing negative sentiment were implemented. Utilizing STSs, in particular, helps identify rhetorical question, which is considered as a challenging task.

Transforming the Justice Delivery System in India through Innovation and Technology: Opportunities and Limitations of Integrating Technology in the Judicial System,2021,"['Right of Access to Justice', 'Justice Delivery System', 'Information and Communication Technology (ICT)', 'Law', 'Artificial Intelligence (AI)']",,"The Constitution of India mandates citizen’s ‘right of access to justice’ and it is the onerous duty of the State to take positive steps in the fulfilment of the right. The ‘right of access to justice’ encompasses within itself two aspects: the right to access courts and tribunals of the country and the right to reasonable speedy and effective justice in any court or tribunal of the country. However, due to huge arrears and pendency of cases in the Indian courts, the State is miserably failing in its constitutional duty to provide right of access to justice. The situation is aggravated due to the spread of pandemic COVID-19 in the year 2020-21, which led to closure of physical court complexes leading to denial of access to justice. With basic infrastructural upgrades, like integration of Information and Communication Technologies in courts, it was seen that India was successfully able to shift its courts on the virtual medium with much ease and success. In the long run, implementing AI-based technologies, like machine learning and natural language processing, to restructure the judicial system will help in reducing the arrears and pendency in the court system. But integration of technology in the judiciary raises some fundamental issues, which needs to be addressed beforehand. At the foremost lies the issue of ‘digital-divide’, which is the disparate distribution of affordable technology among the rural and urban populations of the country. Secondly, the issue of language and the rights of the disabled people. And thirdly, the issue of data privacy with regards to the litigants which is perplexing the dynamics of constitutionalism. It is therefore argued that the policy makers should adopt a principled approach to address the perplexing issues of technology-based solution, for long term integration of technology in the Justice Delivery System."

However, due to the nature of the lamination process, there is a problem that the frequency of error occurrence may vary depending on each layer or physical cell location. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced as the number of write/erase(P/E) operations of the flash memory increases. Most flash-based storage devices such as SSDs use ECC for error correction. Since this method provides a fixed strength of data protection for all flash memory pages, it has limitations in 3D NAND flash memory, where the error rate varies depending on the physical location. Therefore, in this paper, pages and layers with different error rates are classified into clusters through the K-means machine learning algorithm, and differentiated data protection strength is applied to each cluster. We classify pages and layers based on the number of errors measured after endurance test, where the error rate varies significantly for each page and layer, and add parity data to stripes for areas vulnerable to errors to provides differentiate data protection strength. We show the possibility that this differentiated data protection policy can contribute to the improvement of reliability and lifespan of 3D NAND flash memory compared to the protection techniques using RAID-like or ECC alone."

To overcome the problem, a video facial expression recognition method using spatiotemporal recurrent neural network and feature fusion is proposed. Firstly, the video is preprocessed. Then, the double-layer cascade structure is used to detect a face in a video image. In addition, two deep convolutional neural networks are used to extract the time-domain and airspace facial features in the video. The spatial convolutional neural network is used to extract the spatial information features from each frame of the static expression images in the video. The temporal convolutional neural network is used to extract the dynamic information features from the optical flow information from multiple frames of expression images in the video. A multiplication fusion is performed with the spatiotemporal features learned by the two deep convolutional neural networks. Finally, the fused features are input to the support vector machine to realize the facial expression classification task. The experimental results on cNTERFACE, RML, and AFEW6.0 datasets show that the recognition rates obtained by the proposed method are as high as 88.67%, 70.32%, and 63.84%, respectively. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method obtains higher recognition accuracy than other recently reported methods."

This not only provides detailed and clear grammatical feature information for each component constituting the corresponding phrase, but also makes it possible to grasp the relationship between components. In Chinese, “Qilai” and “VQilai” are often utilized and correspond to vocabulary and special phrases foreign learners find it difficult when learning the language. Therefore, the errors occur frequently in translation and syntax analysis machines on which foreign learners rely heavily, and this is believed to be due to poor primary analysis of these components. This paper briefly describes the features and notation of feature grammar and provides grammatical feature information for the verb “Qilai” and three types of “VQilai” phrases. This includes both the syntactic and semantic features, and even suggests as a rudimentary interpretation method an algorithm that can analyze each phrase in more detail. In order to build Chinese language-related devices, systems, or to improve the functions of existing ones, it is required to have a detailed analysis method, process, and result data on Chinese components and sentences. We look forward to continuing this research in language studies."

This study presents the scientific basis for a big data analysis of institutional improvements in fire safety and responses by evaluating the correlation and importance of factors that affect property damage based on whether sprinkler systems are used in buildings to fight structure fires. Independent variables used in property damage analysis utilize building information and the time and distance affecting site access by mobilized equipment and personnel from the Korean National Fire Agency. In the analysis process, independent variables for machine learning were selected by analyzing significance probability and the Pearson correlation between property damage and fire factors. Using random forest, the importance of factors affecting property damage is derived based on whether there was a sprinkler system inside the building or not. In the analysis results, the main factors influencing property damage included mobilized personnel, mobilized equipment, initial time needed to extinguish the fire, the total fire suppression time, etc. If a sprinkler system was installed, the relative importance of the initial fire exhaustion time and the total fire suppression time was calculated to be 34.2% and 3.9% higher, compared to not having a sprinkler system installed. These results show that the use of such fire extinguishing equipment can minimize property damage, so it confirms the need for policy system improvement that can strengthen the installation and operation of fire extinguishing equipment."

McCarthy defined AI as a machine that behaves in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving. Artificial intelligence is a form of “intelligent computing” in that it relies on computer programs that can sense, reason, learn, act, and adapt much like humans do. It is “intelligent” because it emulates human cognition. It is “artificial,” because it involves computational rather than biological information processing. Technically, AI is mainly powered by machine learning algorithms, i.e., algorithms that change in response to their own received inputs and consequently improve with experience. The increasing use of AI and autonomous systems will have revolutionary impacts on society and there are many things we do not know about how AI will impact the law. There is a argument whether we could imagine a human-level AI that demands constitutional rights and should that entitle them to constitutional rights for AI. It could be possible that we can grant the constitutional rights similar to those of corporations and agents for AI, but we are not unable to recognize constitutional rights for AI because they are not natural humans. The reason is as follows. Though AI has consciousness, self-consciousness, autonomy and cognitive abilities, he cannot has ethical personality. Objectivity is not one of AI’s virtues. Rather, algorithms reflect back the biases in the programming that are input when models are designed and in the data used to train them. Modern constitutional principle is based on the premise that ethical human being as a constitutional human character is essential for the prevent and removal of threat to humanity and the improvement the quality of life."

The size of the energy reflected by the IR-UWB Radar differs from body to body, and the amount of energy transmitted is also different.

In this paper, frequency characteristics of each material are confirmed by using FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) transform of the size of reflected wave. As a result, it was confirmed that the frequency characteristics of each material appeared differently, and it was shown that material recognition is possible by collecting the frequency characteristic data for each material and learning it using machine learning such as SVM."

The earthquakes injured many residents, damaged buildings, and affected the economy of Gyeongju and Pohang. The damage proxy maps (DPMs) were generated from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery by comparing pre- and co-events interferometric coherences to identify anomalous changes that indicate damaged by the earthquakes. DPMs manage to detect coherence loss in residential and commercial areas in both Gyeongju and Pohang earthquakes. We found that our results show a good correlation with the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) report with Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale values of more than VII (seven). The color scale of Sentinel-1 DPMs indicates an increasingly significant change in the area covered by the pixel, delineating collapsed walls and roofs from the official report. The resulting maps can be used to assess the distribution of seismic damage after the Gyeongju and Pohang earthquakes and can also be used as inventory data of damaged buildings to map seismic vulnerability using machine learning in Gyeongju or Pohang."

The results showed that 8 topics (‘petrology and geochemistry’, ‘hydrology and hydrogeology’, ‘economic geology’, ‘volcanology’, ‘soil contaminant and remediation’, ‘general and structural geology’, ‘geophysics and geophysical exploration’, and ‘clay mineral’) were identified in the EEG. Before 1994, classic topics (‘economic geology’, ‘volcanology’, and ‘general and structure geology’) were dominant research trends. After 1994, emerging topics (‘hydrology and hydrogeology’, ‘soil contaminant and remediation’, ‘clay mineral’) have arisen, and its portion has gradually increased. The result of association analysis showed that EEG tends to be more comprehensive based on ‘economic geology’. Our results provide understanding of how geological research topics branch out and merge with other fields using a useful literature review tool for geological research in South Korea."

These techniques are mainly used for all type of medical images such as for Chest X-ray, Low-Dose Computed Tomography (CT). These are also used to intensify tiny anatomies like vessels, lung nodules, airways and pulmonary fissures. The proposed techniques consist of two main steps using the MATLAB software (R2021a). First, the technique should apply for the process of normalization for improving the basic image more correctly. In the next, the technique actively rearranges the intensity of the image contrast. Second, the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) method was used for enhancing small details, textures and local contrast of the image. As a result, this paper shows the modern and improved techniques of HE and some advantages of the technique on the traditional HE. Therefore, this paper concludes that various techniques related to the HE can be helpful for many processes, especially image pre-processing for Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL)."

German theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht formulated the Lehrstuck (learning play) theory that aimed to radicalize the relationship between the stage and the actor, in which he suggested that the actor would stand in the place of both acting and observing while performing a character and would reach a self-reflection and awakening through the ‘social gesture (Gestus)’ he/she observed and mimicked. The victim-survivors of the documentary also perform certain social gesture by appearing before the camera, the process of which resonates with the aim of self-reflexivity in both Lehrstuck and the ethnomethodology in qualitative research. Brecht’s Lehrstuck is called a ‘sociological experiment’ in that it pursues the actor’s in-depth understanding of social reality through the performance as an empirical experiment of gestures, which is supported by the self-referencing reflexive principle of ethnomethodology. The two ‘comfort women’ documentaries, My Own Breathing and Comfort, are the cases that show the stage situations of the documentary as sociological experiments. The victim-survivor Lee Yong-soo in My Own Breathing stands before the camera as an interviewer after a repetitive near-vocational training to ask questions, and the three ‘#MeToo’ victim-survivors in Comfort recite the testimony of the late victim-survivor Kim Soon-ak to compare their social experiences with Kim’s own. In these situations, the camera does not just remain a machine to record but becomes a self-reflexive actor that causes actions of the victim-survivors, or intervenes in their actions, and the documentary becomes a stage for sociological practices."

Most companies are investing a lot of capital and time in product planning and development in various ways, including big data analysis, in order to satisfy the needs and services of consumers. In addition, the analysis data of public data that has been disclosed has the advantage that it can be actively used to predict product launch time reflecting the timely demand for new products and to develop new products. However, the success rate of new products is very low in situations where it is difficult to meet consumer needs for new products. In order to solve this problem, some companies have recently outsource some of consumer demand for products through external suppliers, and many companies are applying social buzz analysis to business. In this paper, propose a companion animal product outsourcing system based on web crawling in a situation where companion animals are increasing exponentially due to the recent increase in single-person households and the aging of the population. Through the proposal system, expected that companion animal product developers and planners could shorten the time invested in product development and launch products that meet the needs of consumers. In future research on regression analysis and machine learning should be continued to improve the accuracy of product analysis of the proposed system."

There is also an urgent need for evolving training programs that can foster actors who are capable of adapting across various media channels. In response, we seek to study and present the ‘Respiratory Etude’ as a training model based on the principles of etude creation, focusing on the respiratory training process during the training process of voice acting skill enhancement. The purpose of respiratory training is to go one step further than just using it as a process to learn breathing techniques by using powerful speech organs, instead interpreting it as a means to utilize it as a channel for active emotional stimulation in order to discover the potential of an actor’s voice and create a new nature for him as an actor. In other words, we would like to propose the use of respiratory training as a medium to awaken emotional responses in the actor’s body and to evoke true living, breathing emotions. As is already well known, the etude, unlike improvisation, is an organic implementation tool of the Stanislavski ‘Method of Physical Actions’, a training model designed to consciously trigger psychological and physical behavior in a well-organized theatrical structure in order to stimulate the subconscious and create improvisations through genuine experiences. This study focuses on the moment of genuine encounter brought about by the provocation of natural emotions in a given dramatic situation during the creation process of an etude. With our findings, the following four types of training models for respiratory etudes are presented: 1, warm up – human machine making, fire-breathing dragon 2, animal etude 3, object etude 4, respiratory etude. Through this training model, the actor will be able to tune his body to read his impulses and emotions in a sensitive manner in order to drive a process provoked by impulses that lead to genuine emotions, thereby expanding the actor’s self and awakening the potential of his voice to the world of creation."

The implications of this study are as follows. first. In sports events, there are many situations in which wins or losses occur with equal probability, and there are many variables that cannot be quantified, such as a player's condition and a person playing it. This is the biggest drawback of the field where artificial intelligence makes predictions by learning data called machine learning, so you shouldn't be too blind. Second, competition with players from poor countries or players who do not benefit from artificial intelligence will not be fair competition. Third, with the advent of robot referees, controversy over misappropriation and cases of dissatisfaction with the referee's decision are decreasing, but there is also a sense of crisis that the number of unemployed people will be increased by giving up jobs to robots. Fourth, if the competition between humans and robots is based on win or loss, the emotions of sports will disappear and only pleasure will remain. Fifth, it is a general academic argument that artificial intelligence cannot direct human artistic and philosophical impressions. Sports contain human philosophy. Artificial intelligence without a mind is just a side element of sports and will not be able to contain the true spirit of sports."

Chlorophyll-a concentration, an important marine variable, in the surface layer of the global ocean has been retrieved for decades through various ocean color satellites and utilized in various research fields. However, the commonly used chlorophyll-a concentration algorithm is only suitable for application in clear water and cannot be applied to turbid waters because significant errors are caused by differences in their distinct components and optical properties. In addition, designing a standard algorithm for coastal waters is difficult because of differences in various optical characteristics depending on the coastal area. To overcome this problem, various algorithms have been developed and used considering the components and the variations in the optical properties of coastal waters with high turbidity. Chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval algorithms can be categorized into empirical algorithms, semi-analytic algorithms, and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms mainly use the blue-green band ratio based on the reflective spectrum of sea water as the basic form. In constrast, algorithms developed for turbid water utilizes the greenred band ratio, the red-near-infrared band ratio, and the inherent optical properties to compensate for the effect of dissolved organisms and suspended sediments in coastal area. Reliable retrieval of satellite chlorophyll-a concentration from turbid waters is essential for monitoring the coastal environment and understanding changes in the marine ecosystem.Therefore, this study summarizes the pre-existing algorithms that have been utilized for monitoring turbid Case 2 water and presents the problems associated with the mornitoring and study of seas around the Korean Peninsula. We also summarize the prospective for future ocean color satellites, which can yield more accurate and diverse results regarding the ecological environment with the development of multi-spectral and hyperspectral sensors."

As it was known, 元泳義 was a Classical Chinese scholar and educator in the beginning of modern times. Since the time he was actively involved with the works was coincided with Korean modern times and Japanese colonial times, it had the characteristics of transition in terms of academic works and education. It seemed that the purpose of 初等作文法 was to raise Classical Chinese academic ability and to require the modern grammar book to follow the new education trend. His 初等作文法 was the first Chinese literature grammar book in Korea. There were some research about the backgrounds, meanings, and parts of speech. However, this study was about parts of speech and the discussion of 虛詞 which conveyed the tone of speech as well as nuance. In terms of study in Chinese literature, 虛詞 is the important part in understanding of the meaning and context. 文章體法 , which was comprable to 初等作文法 , written by Lee Jonglin was the ｢虛字法｣ and had the contents of 虛詞. Since ｢虛字法｣ written by Lee Jonglin was just the translation of Chinese materials, therefore, there was the lack of the originality. However, 虛詞論 written by 元泳義 did not refer to other external materials. Espeically, 元泳義 took the example from his original writing and it showed that his level of Chinese literature was excellent to write with deep understanding of 文理 without any limitation. The part of 虛字 or 虛詞說 belong to the column of 【副詞】 and 【接續詞】, 【轉詞】, 【止詞】 in 初等作文法 . It might be applicable to today’s Chinese literature education: To divide into ‘最(the most: 高等), 頗(quite: 次等) and 僅(little: 低等)’ and discuss about the difference. In addition, to explain of ‘然’ or ‘然而’ such as adversative transitions, in the sentence ‘轉詞文句의 轉字가 有이 一種 機器가 輪軸을 全憑旋轉야 活動을 得과 如니(轉詞 might be similar for a machine to get the action from the turning)’, it is visible for two sentences have two different aversive meaning through the sensible expression. In addition, there was various contents about 虛詞, this characteristic of the 虛詞說 in 初等作文法 might have the significant meaning from the modern times to nowadays after 100 years. Nowadays, the education about 虛詞 in the Classical Chinese literature in the middle and high school is not a simple issue, therefore, the study of it has been continued. This 虛詞說 in 初等作文法 was written by 元泳義 who had studied under 省齋 柳重敎(1832~1893), might be valuable materials to help in today’s learning and education of 虛詞."

These systems take into account the daily maximum wind speed to determine the critical wind speed that causes fruit drops and provide the weather risk information to farmers. In an effort to increase the accuracy of wind risk predictions, an artificial neural network for binary classification was implemented. In the present study, the daily wind speed and other weather data, which were measured at weather stations at sites of interest in Jeollabuk-do and Jeollanam-do as well as Gyeongsangbuk-do and p art of Gyeongsangnam-do provinces in 2019, were used f or training the neural network. These weather stations include 210 synoptic and automated weather stations operated by the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA). The wind speed data collected at the same locations between January 1 and December 12, 2020 were used to validate the neural network model. The data collected from December 13, 2020 to February 18, 2021 were used to evaluate the wind risk prediction performance before and after the use of the artificial neural network. The critical wind speed of damage risk was determined to be 11 m/s, which is the wind speed reported to cause fruit drops and damages. Furthermore, the maximum wind speeds were expressed using Weibull distribution probability density function for warning of wind damage. It was found that the accuracy of wind damage risk prediction was improved from 65.36% to 93.62% after re-classification using the artificial neural network. Nevertheless, the error rate also increased from 13.46% to 37.64%, as well. It is likely that the machine learning approach used in the present study would benefit case studies where no prediction by risk warning systems becomes a relatively serious issue."

EU에서 데이터 소유권 논의가 등장한 것은, 데이터의 유통을 촉진하기 위한 것인데 플랫폼은 소유권이 보장되더라도 빅데이터를 유통할 유인이 없기 때문에, 데이터 소유권 인정은 데이터 잠금 현상을 더욱 공고히 할 뿐이다. 오히려 데이터 소유권은 데이터 거래에 참여하는 사람들 사이에 거래비용을 높이고 플랫폼 후발주자 입장에서는 빅데이터로 인해 경쟁력의 격차를 뛰어넘을 수 없게 되어 승자독식현상이 강화되며, 플랫폼 소비자의 개인정보 침해 우려가 높아지게 것이다. Big Tech는 빅데이터로부터 막대한 경제적 이익을 거두고 있는 반면 정보주체들은 Big Tech의 디지털 서비스를 무료로 사용하는 정도의 혜택만 받고 있다는 점에서, 정보주체들에게 데이터 소유권을 인정해 그들에게 경제적 이익을 귀속시켜야 한다는 주장도 있지만, 현재 정보주체에게 인정되는 강력한 개인정보 보호를 넘어서 데이터 소유권을 인정해야 할 필요는 적어 보인다. 플랫폼 소비자와 플랫폼 운영자 사이의 문제는 계약법으로 해결할 수 있으며, 이들 사이 존재하는 불균형은 약관규제법으로 해결할 수 있다. 정보주체들에게 데이터 소유권을 인정하게 되면, 데이터 보유자에게 데이터 소유권을 인정하는 것 이상으로 거래비용이 발생하여 원활한 데이터 경제가 저해될 것이다.","After the Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe explicitly mentioned ‘Data Ownership’ for the purpose of creating the right conditions for thriving digital networks and of making the best use of the growth potential of the digital economy, debates on the possible introduction of data ownership was ignited in Korea. Because the discussion began in the context of the digital economy, the characteristics of big data and of big data economy play an essential role. The first characteristic of data is non-rivarly. By reason of this key characteristic social welfare will in principle be maximized by guaranteeing data sharing or re-use. Furthermore big data consists of personal information and the interest of data holder is in conflict with data subjects. Lastly the marginal cost of production of big data is usually close to zero for the data holder, while the marginal utility derived from big data does never decline because machine learning needs continuously big data. Therefore for the Big Tech who collect and analyse big data, an infinite amount of data is optimal. Another characteristic of data economy is related to the characteristics of online platforms which are the main holders of big data. Platforms show indirect network effects and provide their service cheaply or freely to consumers in order to attract consumers first. The loss thereby is afterwards cross-subsidized from sellers. But customers use platform services not fully free of charge, but in exchange of their personal information. Big Techs collect the personal informations, i.e. big data, and make relentless and effective innovation, which allows the business model of Big Techs competitive and enables “winner-take-all.” Data holder can already rely on the trade secret and contract law. An additional protection for data holder, i.e., data ownership for data holder seems to be unnecessary. The discussion for the data ownership aimed to promote distribution to or re-use of big data by third parties. But there are little incentives for making big data accessible to third parties even if data ownership is guaranteed. Rather the introduction of data ownership would reinforce existing lock-in effects and produce high transaction costs. This would also strengthen the winner-take-all dynamics and increase the probability of abusing personal information. Despite the critics that Big Techs derive enormous economic benefits from big data and data subjects are satisfied with free digital services, the introduction of data ownership for data subjects is for the time being inappropriate. The issue could be handled with contract law and inequality of bargaining power and information asymmetry between platform providers and consumers is at least partly solved by regulation of Terms and Conditions. The data ownership for data subjects will produce unsolvably high transaction costs."
