XGBoost와 SHAP 기법을 활용한 근로자 이직 예측에 관한 연구,2021,"['Employee Turnover', 'XGBoost(eXtreme Gradient Boosting)', 'XAI(eXplainable AI)', 'SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations)']",,"PurposeIn order for companies to continue to grow, they should properly manage human resources, which are the core of corporate competitiveness. Employee turnover means the loss of talent in the workforce. When an employee voluntarily leaves his or her company, it will lose hiring and training cost and lead to the withdrawal of key personnel and new costs to train a new employee. From an employee's viewpoint, moving to another company is also risky because it can be time consuming and costly. Therefore, in order to reduce the social and economic costs caused by employee turnover, it is necessary to accurately predict employee turnover intention, identify the factors affecting employee turnover, and manage them appropriately in the company.Design/methodology/approachPrior studies have mainly used logistic regression and decision trees, which have explanatory power but poor predictive accuracy. In order to develop a more accurate prediction model, XGBoost is proposed as the classification technique. Then, to compensate for the lack of explainability, SHAP, one of the XAI techniques, is applied. As a result, the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is improved compared to the conventional methods such as LOGIT and Decision Trees. By applying SHAP to the proposed model, the factors affecting the overall employee turnover intention as well as a specific sample’s turnover intention are identified.FindingsExperimental results show that the prediction accuracy of XGBoost is superior to that of logistic regression and decision trees. Using SHAP, we find that jobseeking, annuity, eng_test, comm_temp, seti_dev, seti_money, equl_ablt, and sati_safe significantly affect overall employee turnover intention. In addition, it is confirmed that the factors affecting an individual’s turnover intention are more diverse. Our research findings imply that companies should adopt a personalized approach for each employee in order to effectively prevent his or her turnover."
XGBoost를 활용한 이륜자동차 교통사고 심각도 비교분석,2021,,,"Emergence of the COVID 19 pandemic has resulted in a sharp increase in the number of two-wheeler vehicular traffic accidents, prompting the introduction of numerous efforts for their prevention. This study applied XGBoost to determine the factors that affect severity of two-wheeled vehicular traffic accidents, by examining data collected over the past 10 years and analyzing the influence of each factor. Among the total factors assessed, variables affecting the severity of traffic accidents were overwhelmingly high in cases of signal violations, followed by the age group of drivers (60s or older), factors pertaining only to the car, and cases of centerline infringement. Based on the research results, a reasonable legal reform plan was proposed to prevent serious traffic accidents and strengthen safety management of two-wheeled vehicles. Based on the research results, we propose a reasonable legal reform plan to prevent serious traffic accidents and strengthen safety management of two-wheeled vehicles."

ConvXGB consists of several stacked convolutional layers to learn the features of the input and is able to learn features automatically, followed by XGBoost in the last layer for predicting the class labels. The ConvXGB model is simplified by reducing the number of parameters under appropriate conditions, since it is not necessary re-adjust the weight values in a back propagation cycle.

In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been successfully shown to obtain high accuracy of stock price direction. Although there are numerous research studies being conducted regarding the direction of stock price movement, there are relatively few studies on labeling of data for learning algorithms. The problem with incorrectly labeled data sets in intelligent systems based on machine learning is that learner then trains the incorrect identification and knowledge, which will make it harder for trained learners to predict the correct results. Therefore, incorrect labeling methods could cause information loss and may act as a cause of poor prediction performance when implementing a prediction model. To solve this problem, this study proposes an N-period volatility labeling that is based on the volatility of n-period look back window, which is more dynamic. In order to identify the usefulness of the proposed model, this study is compared against the conventional approach. An empirical study of the proposed model is simulated in the Nasdaq stock market."

Despite their predictive performances, the acknowledged drawback of ML techniques is their lack of interpretable features that can be used to evaluate policy impacts. In this sense, this article aims to not only develop discrete choice modeling using ML techniques but also provide the useful insights about demystifying (i.e., interpreting) ML models. In particular, XGBoost, rule-based ensemble model combined with ML, is adopted to predict and understand mode choice behaviors related to Korea-Japan undersea tunnel high-speed train. XGBoost model notably possesses more interpretable algorithmic features than other ML models as well as high degree of predictive power for multi-level data—e.g., stated preference (SP) survey. Overall model estimates were accurated at 81% and also presented high accuracy for each model choice. To interpret users’ behaviors and preferences, variable importance (VI), variable contribution, and interactive partial dependence were estimated. The results of VI indicates that air mode, for instance, was affected by order of air fare, Fukuoka visit frequency, and Japan visit frequency, ferry mode was affected by order of Age, Willing to use tunnel, and Japan visit by air mode, and train mode was affected by train fare, age, and Japan visit frequency."
Performance of Prediction Models for Diagnosing Severe Aortic Stenosis Based on Aortic Valve Calcium on Cardiac Computed Tomography: Incorporation of Radiomics and Machine Learning,2021,"['Aortic valve calcium', 'Aortic stenosis', 'Computed tomography', 'Radiomics', 'Machine learning']",,"Objective: We aimed to develop a prediction model for diagnosing severe aortic stenosis (AS) using computed tomography (CT) radiomics features of aortic valve calcium (AVC) and machine learning (ML) algorithms.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 408 patients who underwent cardiac CT between March 2010 and August 2017 and had echocardiographic examinations (240 patients with severe AS on echocardiography [the severe AS group] and 168 patients without severe AS [the non-severe AS group]). Data were divided into a training set (312 patients) and a validation set (96 patients). Using non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CT scans, AVC was segmented, and 128 radiomics features for AVC were extracted. After feature selection was performed with three ML algorithms (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO], random forests [RFs], and eXtreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost]), model classifiers for diagnosing severe AS on echocardiography were developed in combination with three different model classifier methods (logistic regression, RF, and XGBoost). The performance (c-index) of each radiomics prediction model was compared with predictions based on AVC volume and score.Results: The radiomics scores derived from LASSO were significantly different between the severe AS and non-severe AS groups in the validation set (median, 1.563 vs. 0.197, respectively, p < 0.001). A radiomics prediction model based on feature selection by LASSO + model classifier by XGBoost showed the highest c-index of 0.921 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.869– 0.973) in the validation set. Compared to prediction models based on AVC volume and score (c-indexes of 0.894 [95% CI, 0.815– 0.948] and 0.899 [95% CI, 0.820–0.951], respectively), eight and three of the nine radiomics prediction models showed higher discrimination abilities for severe AS. However, the differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05 for all).Conclusion: Models based on the radiomics features of AVC and ML algorithms may perform well for diagnosing severe AS, but the added value compared to AVC volume and score should be investigated further."

In recent years, our group investigated the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and free-PSA predictive role for prostate cancer (PCa), using the classical binary logistic regression (LR) modeling. In this research, we approached the same clinical problem by several different ML algorithms, to evaluate their performances and feasibility in a real-world evidence PCa detection trial.Materials and Methods: The occurrence of a positive biopsy has been studied in a large cohort of 1,246 Italian men undergoing first or repeat biopsy. Seven supervised ML algorithms were selected to build biomarkers-based predictive models: generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, eXtreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost), distributed random forest/extremely randomized forest, multilayer artificial Deep Neural Network, naïve Bayes classifier, and an automatic ML ensemble function.Results: All the ML models showed better performances in terms of area under curve (AUC) and accuracy, when compared to LR model. Among them, an XGBoost model tuned by the autoML function reached the best metrics (AUC, 0.830), well overtaking LR results (AUC, 0.738). In the variable importance ranking coming from this XGBoost model (accuracy, 0.824), the PCA3 score importance was 3-fold and 4-fold larger, when compared to that of free-PSA and PSA, respectively.Conclusions: The ML approach proved to be feasible and able to achieve good predictive performances with reproducible results: it may thus be recommended, when applied to PCa prediction based on biomarkers fluctuations."

To that end, we use individual-level, high-frequency transaction data from franchise retail stores. Our dataset is promising for machine learning applications given that consumer purchases in our empirical setting are more frequent and their patterns more complex than those used in consumer churn or adoption analyses in the past.  We report that the machine learning techniques of extreme gradient boosting and neural networks exhibit better performances overall than traditional models, but the extent of these improvements is marginal. Although underwhelming, our result is broadly aligned with earlier findings. We offer four conjectures behind this finding: suboptimal neural network design and training, linearly separable data, a suboptimal design with regard to feature engineering, and a need for more data. We further discuss the implications of each in the paper. Our paper will offer precursors and guidelines to academics and practitioners who may be interested in applying machine learning techniques to predict consumers’ repeat purchase behaviors in retail settings."

Ensemble learning-based hierarchical retrieval of similar cases for site planning,2021,"['site planning', 'similarity retrieval', 'parcel representation', 'XGBoost algorithm']",,"Site planning not only involves the arrangement of a large number of elements but also considers the complexity of urban systems; hence, the design process involves large workloads and is time consuming. Retrieving similar existing cases helps architects optimize or accelerate the design process. This paper proposes a computational approach that provides valuable references by retrieving similar cases. Three types of attributes are extracted to represent a given parcel: land-use attributes, geometric attributes (area, orientation, etc.), and environmental attributes (greening rate, surrounding facilities, etc.). The complete hierarchical retrieval process is divided into three phases. The first phase selects cases whose land-use attributes are consistent with the target parcel. Then, the similarity distances between the given target parcel and the selected cases are calculated using geometric attributes. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier is adopted to determine which case is similar to the target parcel. Finally, similarity scores of the retrieved cases are calculated based on the environmental attributes to provide more options during the actual design. In total, 1189 cases with different land-use types in Beijing were collected for the case base. The comparative experimental results confirmed that the proposed ensemble learning-based hierarchical retrieval of similar cases approach improves the accuracy of retrieval results. Furthermore, we use a real-world target parcel to demonstrate the superiority and flexibility of the retrieval process."

Increased suspended sediment concentration (SSC) has various effects on water supply systems such as increased treatment cost and consequently, there have been various efforts to develop a model for predicting SSC. However, SSC is affected by both the natural and anthropogenic environment, making it challenging to predict SSC. Recently, advanced machine learning models have increasingly been used for water quality prediction. This study developed an ensemble machine learning model to predict SSC using the XGBoost (XGB) algorithm. The observed discharge (Q) and SSC in two fields monitoring stations were used to develop the model. The input variables were clustered in two groups with low and high ranges of Q using the k-means clustering algorithm. Then each group of data was separately used to optimize XGB (Model 1). The model performance was compared with that of the XGB model using the entire data (Model 2). The models were evaluated by mean squared error-observation standard deviation ratio (RSR) and root mean squared error. The RSR were 0.51 and 0.57 in the two monitoring stations for Model 2, respectively, while the model performance improved to RSR 0.46 and 0.55, respectively, for Model 1."

Therefore, this study aimed to discriminate adrenal tumors from a single blood sample based on the combination of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and machine learning algorithms in serum profiling of adrenal steroids.Methods: The LC-MS-based steroid profiling was applied to serum samples obtained from patients with nonfunctioning adenoma(NFA, n=73), Cushing’s syndrome (CS, n=30), and primary aldosteronism (PA, n=40) in a prospective multicenter study of adrenaldisease. The decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) were performed to categorize the subtypes of adrenal tumors.Results: The CS group showed higher serum levels of 11-deoxycortisol than the NFA group, and increased levels of tetrahydrocortisone (THE), 20α-dihydrocortisol, and 6β-hydroxycortisol were found in the PA group. However, the CS group showed lower levelsof dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate derivative (DHEA-S) than both the NFA and PA groups. Patients with PA expressed higher serum 18-hydroxycortisol and DHEA but lower THE than NFA patients. The balanced accuracies of DT, RF, andXGBoost for classifying each type were 78%, 96%, and 97%, respectively. In receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis forCS, XGBoost, and RF showed a significantly greater diagnostic power than the DT. However, in ROC analysis for PA, only RF exhibited better diagnostic performance than DT.Conclusion: The combination of LC-MS-based steroid profiling with machine learning algorithms could be a promising one-stepdiagnostic approach for the classification of adrenal tumor subtypes."

KSURE(Korea Trade Insurance Corporation) is a major public institution for financial policy in Korea, and thus the company is strongly committed to backing export companies with various systems. Nevertheless, there are still fewer cases of realized business model based on big-data analyses.  In this situation, this paper aims to develop a new business model which can be applied to an ex-ante prediction for the likelihood of the insurance accident of credit guarantee. We utilize internal data from KSURE which supports export companies in Korea and apply machine learning models. Then, we conduct performance comparison among the predictive models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN(Deep Neural Network).  For decades, many researchers have tried to find better models which can help to predict bankruptcy since the ex-ante prediction is crucial for corporate managers, investors, creditors, and other stakeholders. The development of the prediction for financial distress or bankruptcy was originated from Smith(1930), Fitzpatrick(1932), or Merwin(1942). One of the most famous models is the Altmans Z-score model(Altman, 1968) which was based on the multiple discriminant analysis. This model is widely used in both research and practice by this time. The author suggests the score model that utilizes five key financial ratios to predict the probability of bankruptcy in the next two years. Ohlson(1980) introduces logit model to complement some limitations of previous models. Furthermore, Elmer and Borowski(1988) develop and examine a rule-based, automated system which conducts the financial analysis of savings and loans.  Since the 1980s, researchers in Korea have started to examine analyses on the prediction of financial distress or bankruptcy. Kim(1987) analyzes financial ratios and develops the prediction model. Also, Han et al.(1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2005, 2006) construct the prediction model using various techniques including artificial neural network. Yang(1996) introduces multiple discriminant analysis and logit model. Besides, Kim and Kim(2001) utilize artificial neural network techniques for ex-ante prediction of insolvent enterprises. After that, many scholars have been trying to predict financial distress or bankruptcy more precisely based on diverse models such as Random Forest or SVM. One major distinction of our research from the previous research is that we focus on examining the predicted probability of default for each sample case, not only on investigating the classification accuracy of each model for the entire sample.  Most predictive models in this paper show that the level of the accuracy of classification is about 70% based on the entire sample. To be specific, LightGBM model shows the highest accuracy of 71.1% and Logit model indicates the lowest accuracy of 69%. However, we confirm that there are open to multiple interpretations. In the context of the business, we have to put more emphasis on efforts to minimize type 2 error which causes more harmful operating losses for the guaranty company. Thus, we also compare the classification accuracy by splitting predicted probability of the default into ten equal intervals.  When we examine the classification accuracy for each interval, Logit model has the highest accuracy of 100% for 0~10% of the predicted probability of the default, however, Logit model has a relatively lower accuracy of 61.5% for 90~100% of the predicted probability of the default. On the other hand, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and DNN indicate more desirable results since they indicate a higher level of accuracy for both 0~10% and 90~100% of the predicted probability of the default but have a lower level of accur"
Forecasting KOSPI Return Using a Modified Stochastic AdaBoosting,2021,"['Machine Learning', 'AdaBoost', 'XGBoost', 'Decaying Convergence Rate']",,"AdaBoost tweaks the sample weight for each training set used in the iterative process, however, it is demonstrated that it provides more correlated errors as the boosting iteration proceeds if models’ accuracy is high enough. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel way to improve the performance of the existing AdaBoost algorithm by employing heterogeneous models and a stochastic twist. By employing the heterogeneous ensemble, it ensures different models that have a different initial assumption about the data are used to improve on diversity. Also, by using a stochastic algorithm with a decaying convergence rate, the model is designed to balance out the trade-off between model prediction performance and model convergence. The result showed that the stochastic algorithm with decaying convergence rate’s did have a improving effect and outperformed other existing boosting techniques."

머신러닝 분석을 통한 분양가 상한제의 주택시장 영향 연구,2021,"['분양가상한제', '랜덤포레스트', 'Price Ceiling System', 'XGBoost', 'Random Forest']",,"Housing prices in Korea continued to rise with the consumer’s desire for asset increase and suppliers’ desire for profit, and the government introduced a price ceiling system in 1972 to stabilize housing prices. The government expected that housing stability would be achieved by introducing the price ceiling system, but there was a constant controversy over the effect of it. Some experts argued that the price ceiling system does not affect existing housing prices, but rather reduces housing supply, which increases price in the long run. In this study, we intend to analyze the impact of the price ceiling system on housing market forecast by predicting housing market based on the presence or absence of the price ceiling system and comparing the accuracy. Several previous research have studied the factors affecting housing price, but this only identified the correlation, and there was insufficient of research on housing price prediction according to actual policy. To overcome such statistical limitations, this paper predicts housing price using machine learning that can be interpreted with high accuracy even if input variables are incomplete, wide, or irregular. As a result of analysis, the difference between RMSE(Root Mean Error), error rate mean, and error rate standard deviation was insignificant even if the price ceiling system was applied or not. This means that the housing market is more affected by other factors than the price ceiling system."

A variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosted regression tree (BRT), XGBoost (XGB), and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) were used for predicting the occurrence of four benthic macroinvertebrate species. The Bayesian optimization method successfully tuned model hyperparameters, with all ML models resulting an area under the curve (AUC) > 0.7. Also, hyperparameter search ranges that generally clustered around the optimal values suggest the efficiency of the Bayesian optimization in finding optimal sets of hyperparameters. Tree based ensemble algorithms (BRT, RF, and XGB) tended to show higher performances than SVM and MLP. Important hyperparameters and optimal values differed by species and ML model, indicating the necessity of hyperparameter tuning for improving individual model performances. The optimization results demonstrate that for all macroinvertebrate species SVM and RF required fewer numbers of trials until obtaining optimal hyperparameter sets, leading to reduced computational cost compared to other ML algorithms.

To this end, 15 proactive information (e.g., number of stories and period of construction) that are usually available prior to construction were considered and two over-sampling techniques (SMOTE and ADASYN) were used to address the problem of class-imbalanced data. The results showed that all machine learning methods achieved 0.876~0.941 in the F1-score with the adoption of over-sampling techniques.

It has been consistently highlighted that the offer price does not properly reflect the corporate value in the Korean domestic IPO market. In most studies, the initial yield of IPO shares is around 20% to 30% on average but it is significantly affected by extreme values with high deviations. The wide variation in the yield of individual public offer shares makes it difficult to predict their stock price. Therefore, this study contributes to investors’ investment decisions by introducing machine learning algorithms to predict the closing price and closing price returns over the initial price of the listing.

기계학습법을 통한 압축 벤토나이트의 열전도도 추정 모델 평가,2021,"['공학적 방벽', '벤토나이트 완충재', '열전도도', '기계학습법', 'Engineered barrier system', 'Compacted bentonite', 'Thermal conductivity', 'Machine learning method']","완충재는 고준위 방사성 폐기물을 처분하기 위한 공학적 방벽 시스템에서 중요한 구성요소 중 하나이며 사용 후 핵연료가 담긴 처분용기와 암반사이에 채워지는 물질이기 때문에 지하수 유입으로부터 처분용기를 보호하고, 방사성 핵종 유출을 저지하는 중요한 역할을 수행한다. 따라서 공학적 방벽 시스템의 처분용기로부터 발생하는 고온의 열량은 완충재를 통하여 전파되기에 완충재의 열전도도는 처분시스템의 안전성 평가에 매우 중요하다. 본 연구에서는 국내에서 생산되는 압축 벤토나이트 완충재의 열전도도 예측을 위한 경험적 회귀 모델의 정합성을 검증하고 정확도를 높이기 위해 예측모델의 구축에 기계학습법을 적용해 보았다. 벤토나이트의 건조밀도, 함수비 및 온도 값을 바탕으로 열전도도를 예측하고자 하였으며, 이때 다항 회귀, 결정 트리, 서포트 벡터 머신, 앙상블, 가우시안 프로세스 회귀, 인공신경망, 심층 신뢰 신경망, 유전 프로그래밍과 같은 기계학습 기법을 적용하였다. 기계학습 기법을 이용하여 예측한 결과, 부스팅 기반의 앙상블 기법, 유전 프로그래밍, 3차 함수 기반의 SVM,가우시안 프로세스 회귀의 기계학습기법을 활용한 모델이 선형 회귀 분석 기법에 비해 좋은 성능을 보였으며, 특히 앙상블의 부스팅 기법과 가우시안 프로세스 회귀 기법을 사용한 모델들이 가장 좋은 성능을 보였다.","The buffer is a key component of an engineered barrier system that safeguards the disposal of high-level radioactive waste. Buffers arelocated between disposal canisters and host rock, and they can restrain the release of radionuclides and protect canisters from the inflow of ground water. Since considerable heat is released from a disposal canister to the surrounding buffer, the thermal conductivity of the buffer is a very important parameter in the entire disposal safety. For this reason, a lot of research has been conducted on thermal conductivity prediction models that consider various factors. In this study, the thermal conductivity of a buffer is estimated using the machine learning methods of: linear regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), ensemble, Gaussian process regression (GPR), neural network, deep belief network, and genetic programming. In the results, the machine learning methods such as ensemble, genetic programming, SVM with cubic parameter, and GPR showed better performance compared with the regression model, with the ensemble with XGBoost and Gaussian process regression models showing best performance."
